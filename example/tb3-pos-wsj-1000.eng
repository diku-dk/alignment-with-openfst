The current account deficit on France 's balance of payments narrowed to 1.48 billion French francs ( $ 236.8 million ) in August from a revised 2.1 billion francs in July , the Finance Ministry said .
Previously , the July figure was estimated at a deficit of 613 million francs .
Seasonally adjusted figures for August were n't available because of a recent strike
that has disrupted the ministry 's data collection .
Every workday at 11 a.m. , 40-year-old Mike Sinyard dons cycling clothes , hops on a bike
he keeps at his Morgan Hill , Calif. , office and sets out to cover a distance most people would travel only by car .
As many as 50 of his employees at Specialized Bicycle Components Inc. ride with him .
When they return to their desks at 1 p.m. , they have pedaled 20 miles .
Such fervor for cycling helped Mr. Sinyard build a creative company at the forefront of its industry .
Founded by bike enthusiasts rather than businessmen , Specialized spotted the appeal of fat-tired bikes
that go almost anywhere and began mass-producing them in 1981 .
In the past five years , the company 's sales have grown to $ 80 million from $ 26 million .
Today , so-called mountain bikes account for two-thirds of the $ 2 billion spent annually on all bicycles in the U.S .
With 65 % of its sales coming from mountain bikes , Specialized is widely considered to be a market leader .
( Accessories , largely for mountain-bike users , account for much of the rest of sales .
)
But today , the company needs its entrepreneurial spirit more than ever .
One large competitor after another is leaping into the booming market Specialized helped create , turning out mountain bikes with such well-known names as Schwinn , Peugeot , Raleigh and Nishiki .
Thus , Mr. Sinyard 's company must innovate more than ever to stay ahead of them , by developing new products specifically for mountain biking .
At the same time , though , it must become more structured to better manage its growth .
Accomplishing both will be a balancing act as challenging as riding a unicycle .
It is a problem common to small companies
that have grown fast -- especially when their success attracts big-time competitors .
`` The big word around Specialized is passion , '' says Erik Eidsmo , a former ski-industry executive
whom Mr. Sinyard recruited from Citicorp to run marketing and sales .
`` What
I hope to bring to this is another word : process .
That 's my challenge .
It 's Mike 's challenge as well .
''
Mr. Eidsmo is one of several key people from outside the cycling industry
who were hired to bring the free-wheeling , fast-growing company under tighter control .
`` We had a lot of problems , '' Mr. Sinyard says .
While the company 's sales were soaring , `` We still had a system
that was probably appropriate for $ 10 million to $ 20 million in sales .
'' Adds Mr. Eidsmo , `` What felt good that day was done that day .
Since his arrival in May , Mr. Eidsmo has put in place techniques learned while working for Citicorp , such as management-by-objective , detailed project plans and forecasts of company sales and product trends .
`` We 're finally getting -- and it 's been very painful -- some understanding of what
the company 's long-term horizon should begin to look like , '' Mr. Eidsmo says .
`` But it 's risky , '' he says of Specialized
's attempt to adopt a corporate structure .
`` You do n't want to lose the magic '' of the company 's creative drive .
Hoping to stay ahead of the pack , the company is emphasizing innovation .
At a recent trade show , convention-goers lined up to view a new Specialized bike frame
that weighs just 2.7 pounds -- a pound less than the lightest mountain-bike frame on the market .
By replacing the frame 's steel lugs with titanium ones , Mr. Sinyard 's company plans to make its next generation of frames even lighter .
At the trade show , Specialized also unveiled a revolutionary three-spoked bike wheel developed jointly by Specialized and Du Pont Co .
Made of space-age materials , the wheel spokes are designed like airplane wings to shave 10 minutes off the time of a rider in a 100-mile race , the company claims .
It currently costs $ 750 , though Mr. Sinyard thinks the price can be reduced within three years to between $ 200 and $ 250 .
He was able to slash the price of the company 's least expensive mountain bike to $ 279 from $ 750 in
But demands on the company 's creativity are certain to grow .
Competition is intensifying as larger companies invade a mountain-bike market Mr. Sinyard 's company once had virtually all to itself .
U.S. Cycling Federation official Philip Milburn says mountain biking is `` growing at such a monstrous rate that a lot of companies are getting into this .
One especially coveted Specialized market
the new players are targeting is mountain-bike accessories , which
Mr. Eidsmo calls `` the future of our business .
'' Accessories not only sell faster than whole bikes , they also offer profit margins nearly double the 25 % to 30 % or so on sales of complete cycles .
To get a piece of the business , Nike Inc. , Beaverton , Ore. , introduced a line of mountain-bike shoes .
About a month ago , Michelin Tire Corp. , Greenville , S.C. , began selling mountain-bike tires , for years
a Specialized stronghold .
Competition in the sale of complete bikes is heating up too .
Trek Bicycle Corp. , which accounts for one-quarter of the $ 400 million in annual sales at its Milwaukee-based parent , Intrepid Corp. , entered the mountain-bike business in 1983 .
Trek previously made only traditional road bikes , but `` it did n't take a rocket scientist to change a road bike into a mountain bike , '' says Trek 's president , Dick Burke .
The segment now makes up roughly two-thirds of his company 's total sales .
At Giant Bicycle Inc. , Rancho Dominguez , Calif. , sales have tripled since the company entered the U.S. mountain-bike business in 1987 .
A subsidiary of a Taiwanese holding company with world-wide sales of $ 150 million , Giant is one example of the sudden globalization of Mr. Sinyard 's once-cozy market niche .
Schwinn Bicycle Co. , Chicago , established joint ventures with bike companies in mainland China and Hungary to sell bikes .
In the past year , Derby International Corp. , Luxembourg , has acquired such major brands as Peugeot , Raleigh and Nishiki .
In response to the internationalization of the business , Mr. Sinyard 's company is replacing independent distributors overseas with wholly owned subsidiaries .
The move will cut out the cost of a middleman and give Specialized more control over marketing and sales .
But as Bill Austin , Giant 's president , puts it , `` With some of the bigger players consolidating their strength , the game has changed .
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell to a seasonally adjusted 332,000 for the week ended Oct. 14 from 396,000
the previous week , the Labor Department said .
The number of people receiving state benefits in the week ended Oct. 7 fell to a seasonally adjusted 2,202,000 , or 2.1 % of those covered by unemployment insurance , from 2,205,000
the previous week , when the insured unemployment rate was 2.2 % .
Counting all state and federal benefit programs , the number of people receiving unemployment benefits in the week ended Oct. 7 fell to 1,784,400 from 1,810,700
a week earlier .
These figures are n't seasonally adjusted .
Revco D.S. Inc. , the drugstore chain
that filed for bankruptcy-court protection last year , received a $ 925 million offer from a group led by Texas billionaire Robert Bass .
Revco reacted cautiously , saying the plan would add $ 260 million of new debt to the highly leveraged company .
It was Revco 's huge debt from its $ 1.3 billion leveraged buy-out in 1986 that forced it to seek protection under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code .
Revco insists that the proposal is simply an `` expression of interest , '' because under Chapter 11 Revco has `` exclusivity rights '' until Feb. 28 .
Those rights prevent anyone other than Revco from proposing a reorganization plan .
Also under Chapter 11 , a reorganization plan is subject to approval by bondholders , banks and other creditors .
A financial adviser for Revco bondholders , David Schulte , of Chilmark Partners , had mixed reactions to the offer .
He said he feared a Revco reorganization might force bondholders to accept a `` cheap deal , '' and that the Bass group 's offer would give them more money .
However , the group is offering to pay off bondholders in cash only -- $ 260.5 million -- and no equity .
The Revco bonds are high-yield , high-risk `` junk '' bonds ; holders have $ 750 million in claims against Revco , Mr. Schulte said .
Revco received the offer Oct. 20 , but issued a response yesterday only after a copy of the proposal was made public by bondholders .
Acadia Partners Limited Partnership , a Fort Worth , Texas , partnership
that includes the Robert M. Bass Group , made the proposal .
Mr. Bass is based in Fort Worth .
Analysts said the nation 's second-largest drugstore chain was a valuable company , despite its financial woes .
Its problem , they say , is that management paid too much in the leveraged buy-out and the current $ 515 million debt load is keeping Revco in the red .
`` If bought at the right price , it could still be profitable , '' said Jeffrey Stein , an analyst at McDonald & Co. , Cleveland .
In addition , Revco 's 1,900 stores in 27 states represent a lot of real estate , he said , and demographics are helping pharmacies : The nation 's aging population will boost demand for prescription drugs .
Last week , Revco 's parent company , Anac Holding Corp. , said the company reported a loss of $ 16.2 million for the fiscal first quarter , compared with a loss of $ 27.9 million in the year-earlier quarter .
Sales were $ 597.8 million , up 2.4 % from the previous year .
The company , based in Twinsburg , Ohio , said its operating profit before depreciation and amortization increased 51 % , to $ 9.2 million from $ 6.1 million .
Acadia Partners and the Bass Group declined to comment .
The partnership also includes American Express Co. , Equitable Life Assurance Society of the U.S. and Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc .
The offer consists of $ 410.5 million in cash and the rest in notes .
Acadia would sell up to 10 % of the equity in the reorganized company to creditors and bondholders in exchange for the cash distribution , but creditors and bondholders would receive no discount for their shares .
Revco 's chairman and chief executive officer , Boake A. Sells , said both
the company and the bondholders have put forth reorganization plans , but little progress has been made since negotiations began this summer .
He said he has not met with representatives from Acadia .
Any reorganization proposal , Mr. Sells said , is difficult to assess because it must be agreed upon by the company , bondholders , banks and other creditors .
Revco has $ 1.5 billion in claims outstanding .
`` It 's not like the board can decide '' by itself , Mr. Sells said , adding , `` we 're indifferent to ( the Bass ) plan .
We just want a plan that satisfies creditors and at the end leaves a healthy Revco .
But Mr. Schulte , the bondholders ' adviser , said Revco was dragging its feet in responding to the proposal .
`` They want to pretend it does n't exist , '' he said .
Mr. Schulte , who met with Acadia representatives on Oct. 10 , said , `` It 's certainly a responsible offer .
It 's not an effort to steal the company '' in the middle of the night .
American Telephone & Telegraph Co. unveiled a sweetened pension and early-retirement program for management that it hopes will enable it to save $ 450 million in the next year .
AT&T also said net income rose 19 % in the third quarter .
AT&T said its amended pension program will nearly double to 34,000
the number of managers eligible to retire with immediate pension payments .
AT&T said that based on studies of other companies
that have offered retirement plans , it expects about one-third of its eligible managers to retire under the new program .
AT&T said third-quarter net income grew , despite stiff competition in all of the company 's markets .
Net income rose to $ 699 million , or 65 cents
a share , from the year-earlier $ 587 million , or 55 cents
a share .
Revenue edged up to $ 8.9 billion from $ 8.81 billion .
The latest period 's net was reduced $ 102 million , or nine cents
a share , for a change in depreciation method and concurrent changes in estimates of depreciable lives and net salvage for certain telecommunications equipment .
The results roughly matched estimates of securities analysts , who were encouraged by AT&T increasing its operating margin to 13 % from 11 %
a year ago , because of continued cost-cutting efforts .
Sales of long-distance services , an extremely competitive market , rose 6.4 % .
But the growth was partly offset by lower equipment sales and rentals and price cuts on some products .
Under the amended pension program , AT&T managers
who have at least five years of service will have five years added to their age and length of service for pension purposes .
Managers
who retire Dec. 30 will have an additional 15 % added to their monthly pension for as long as five years or age 65 , whichever comes earlier .
An AT&T spokeswoman said the company would likely replace about one-third of its managers
who choose to retire with new employees .
Analysts hailed the sweetened pension package , which
they said had been the subject of rumors for several months .
`` This tells you
AT&T is serious about continuing to manage their cost structure and is committed to 20%-a-year earnings growth , '' said Jack Grubman , an analyst with PaineWebber Inc .
But other analysts expressed disappointment that the cost-cutting move wo n't result in even greater earnings growth .
`` This is a good move , but it only gets you to where people 's expectations already are , '' in terms of earnings growth , said Joel D. Gross , an analyst with Donaldson , Lufkin & Jenrette .
Mr. Gross said he had hoped that a cost savings of $ 450 million would result in even greater growth than the 20 % annual earnings increase AT&T has told analysts
it expects in the future .
AT&T said the special retirement option will increase fourth-quarter expenses .
But the company said the amount ca n't be determined until it knows how many managers opt to retire .
AT&T said the expense increase will be largely offset by a gain from its previously announced plan to swap its holdings in Ing .
C. Olivetti & Co. for shares in Cie .
Industriali Riunite , an Italian holding company .
For the nine months , AT&T said net income was $ 1.99 billion , or $ 1.85
a share , up 19 % from $ 1.67 billion , or $ 1.56
Revenue gained 3.1 % to $ 26.81 billion from $ 26 billion .
In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange , AT&T shares closed at $ 43.375 , up 87.5 cents .
Bankers Trust New York Corp. won permission from the Federal Reserve Board to move the company 's private placement department to its fledgling securities subsidiary .
The seemingly mundane action , which was opposed by the Securities Industry Association , a trade group , has important implications for banks ' recent entry into the underwriting of corporate securities .
The Fed 's action increases the volume of publicly registered securities that banks ' securities affiliates will be able to underwrite .
Several other banks have similar applications pending .
Over the past two years , the Fed has given a handful of banks ' securities affiliates permission to underwrite and deal in a variety of corporate , asset-backed and municipal securities
that had previously been the sole domain of securities firms .
Securities firms have challenged those Fed approvals , saying they violate federal laws separating the banking and securities businesses .
However , the Fed limited the revenue that banks could earn from these new underwriting activities to no more than 10 % of the revenue earned from other securities activities long open to banks , such as dealing in U.S. Treasurys .
For some banks that 10 % ceiling created problems .
But , by allowing BT Securities Inc. to handle private placements , the Fed boosted the volume of new types of underwriting that the unit can do .
Private placements involve debt and equity securities , typically in denominations of $ 1 million , that are sold to institutional investors and are n't registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission .
Last year , Bankers Trust said it placed $ 10 billion of corporate debt and equities privately .
Boston Edison Co. said it will take a previously reported $ 60 million charge against earnings in the fourth quarter .
The charge resulted from a settlement approved yesterday by the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities .
As expected , the settlement limits rate increases for three years and ties future charges to customers for operation of the troubled Pilgrim Nuclear Power Station to that plant 's performance .
In its order , the state regulatory agency said the company `` must be held accountable for the mistakes made in the management of the plant 's operation .
'' Pilgrim had been closed for 32 months .
Furukawa Electric Co. said it plans to increase production of computer memory devices on a large scale in the U.S. and Japan .
As part of the move , its affiliated U.S. company , International Components Technology Corp. , purchased a Mexican plant formerly belonging to KSI Disc Products Inc .
The price was n't disclosed .
Together with two existing plants in the U.S. , Furukawa said it will expand its current local monthly production of memory disks to 1.4 million sheets from 800,000 .
In Japan , Furukawa said it will raise production at a plant outside Tokyo to 300,000 sheets monthly from 100,000 .
Furukawa said the U.S. market is strengthening as related computer technology gains in sophistication and quality .
Singer Bette Midler won a $ 400,000 federal court jury verdict against Young & Rubicam in a case
that threatens a popular advertising industry practice of using `` sound-alike '' performers to tout products .
The decision in Los Angeles federal court stems from a 1985 Mercury Sable TV ad that Young & Rubicam worked up for Ford Motor Co .
The ad agency had approached Ms. Midler about appearing , but she declined , citing a longstanding policy of refusing advertising work .
The agency then turned to a former backup singer for Ms. Midler
who appeared in the ad and crooned what was generally considered a more than credible imitation of Ms. Midler 's 1973 hit song `` Do You Wanna Dance .
The appeals court held : `` When a distinctive voice of a professional singer is widely known and is deliberately imitated in order to sell a product , the sellers have appropriated what is not theirs .
The judge in the jury trial said there was insufficient evidence to hold Ford liable in the case .
In a statement , Young & Rubicam called the award `` unfortunate but bearable .
Peter Laird , a Los Angeles lawyer for Ms. Midler , said , `` We believe that the verdict reaffirms her position and our position that advertisers and advertising agencies can not with impunity imitate the voices of well-known performers .
That is a property right
that belongs to the performer .
The award , although far less than the $ 10 million , including punitive damages , that Ms. Midler sought , is likely to force Madison Avenue to further rethink how they use famous songs in ads .
Last year 's appeals court decision , for instance , spawned several suits , reportedly including a recent action by the heirs of singer Bobby Darin against McDonald 's Corp. over its `` Mac Tonight '' TV commercials , a rough parody of Mr. Darin 's `` Mack
the Knife '' trademark .
The appeals-court decision last year was particularly surprising because the same court had dismissed a similar case in 1970 involving singer Nancy Sinatra and a tire ad -- also a Young & Rubicam product .
Ms. Sinatra sued over the use of her `` These Boots are Made for Walkin ' '' song in the ad .
At that time , the court held that such a claim would interfere with federal copyright law , which has always cracked down on the unauthorized copying of songs and musical compositions but never actual performances .
`` One thing
that is a little unnerving is that you had three old men on the court of appeals in California coming up with a statement that Nancy Sinatra is not distinctive but that Bette Midler is .
I am not sure that judges , many of whom
I like very much , are proper repositories for making distinctions about pop singers , '' said Richard Kurnit , a New York advertising lawyer .
Nonetheless , Mr. Kurnit said that the latest decisions are having a chilling effect .
`` It has made people think twice about how they use music and is forcing them to be more circumspect about doing a particular rendition of a song in its most famous form , '' he said .

Just five months after Ogilvy Group was swallowed up in an unsolicited takeover , Kenneth Roman , Ogilvy 's chairman and chief executive officer , said he is leaving to take a top post at American Express Co .
Mr. Roman , 59 years old , abruptly announced he will leave the venerable ad agency , whose largest client is American Express , to become American Express 's executive vice president for corporate affairs and communications .
He will succeed Harry L. Freeman , 57 , who has said he will retire in December .
Mr. Freeman said in August that he would retire by the end of this year to take `` executive responsibility '' for an embarrassing effort to discredit banker Edmond Safra .
American Express representatives apparently influenced the publication of unfavorable articles about Mr. Safra .
The company later apologized and agreed to make $ 8 million in contributions to charities chosen by him .
Although Mr. Freeman is retiring , he will continue to work as a consultant for American Express on a project basis .
Ad industry executives were n't surprised by Mr. Roman 's decision to leave Ogilvy .
The agency , under his direction , bitterly fought a takeover attempt by WPP Group PLC of London before succumbing in May .
And although Mr. Roman and WPP 's chief executive , Martin Sorrell , have gone out of their way to be publicly supportive of each other , people close to Mr. Roman say he was unhappy giving up control of the company .
Some executives also cite tension because of efforts by Mr. Sorrell , a financial man , to cut costs at the agency .
Mr. Roman will be succeeded as the head of Ogilvy 's flagship ad agency , Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide , by Graham Phillips , 50 , who had been president of North American operations and who , like Mr. Sorrell , is British .
Alexander Brody , 56 , will take on the newly created position of president of the world-wide agency and chief executive of its international operations .
He had been president of the international operations .
Mr. Roman also had overseen Ogilvy Group 's two other units , the Scali McCabe Sloves advertising agency and its research division , but those units will now report directly to WPP .
Mr. Roman appears custom-made for the American Express job .
Known as a traditional executive , he is very much in the conservative American Express mold .
Moreover , after 26 years at Ogilvy
he had honed a reputation for being squeaky-clean and a straight arrow -- which can only help American Express in the wake of the Safra incident .
He also is close to American Express 's chairman and chief executive officer , James D. Robinson III .
Aside from working with Mr. Robinson on the American Express advertising account for about 11 years , Mr. Roman serves on several of the same charities and boards as Mr. Robinson .
The abrupt management change sparked widespread speculation that Mr. Roman had been pushed out of Ogilvy 's top spot by Mr. Sorrell .
But Mr. Roman flatly denied the speculation , saying Mr. Sorrell had tried several times to persuade him to stay , offering various incentives and in one instance sending a note with a case of wine ( The wine , naturally , was Seagram 's brand , an Ogilvy client ) .
`` He asked me not to resign .
The implication that I was pushed aside would n't be accurate , '' Mr. Roman said .
Mr. Sorrell , traveling in the Far East , could n't be reached .
Mr. Roman said American Express 's Mr. Robinson first approached him about the job in late September .
According to industry executives , Peter Sutherland , a former European Community commissioner from Ireland , was also a serious contender for the American Express job .
Although it ultimately was n't offered to him , he will be on retainer to American Express as an adviser on international matters .
After talking on and off for the past four weeks , Mr. Roman said , he agreed to take the job because `` it 's the right time , it 's a terrific opportunity , and I think I leave the company in very strong hands .
It was my decision , not anyone else 's .
Mr. Roman also brushed aside reports about infighting between him and Mr. Phillips , his successor at Ogilvy .
The two executives could hardly be more different .
Mr. Roman comes across as a low-key executive ; Mr. Phillips has a flashier personality .
During time off , Mr. Roman tends to his garden ; Mr. Phillips confesses to a fondness for , among other things , fast cars and planes .
Industry executives say that although the two executives used to clash more frequently , the WPP takeover brought them closer together .
`` I 'm the guy
who made him
head of New York , head of the U.S. , president of North America , and recommended him { to Mr. Sorrell } as my successor .
Would I have done all those things successively if I did n't think he was the right guy ?
'' Mr. Roman asked .
He labeled reports of friction `` ridiculous , '' and said that he spent part of the weekend on Mr. Phillips 's boat in Connecticut .
Mr. Roman will oversee American Express 's public relations and government affairs , among other things , but he wo n't be involved in its advertising , which is handled by the operating units .
`` I consider this a second career , '' he said .
He also will sit on the company 's corporate planning and policy committee , made up of the top corporate and operating executives .
Mr. Roman 's departure is n't expected to have any enormous repercussions at Ogilvy .
American Express , Kraft General Foods , and Mattel executives said the move wo n't affect their relationships with the ad agency .
`` General Foods 's relationships with its agencies are based on the agencies ' work , and will continue to be , '' said David Hurwitt , a vice president of Kraft General Foods .
But some clients and analysts expressed concern that Mr. Phillips is n't as well-known to many clients .
`` Ken was my key contact , '' said J. Nicholas Hahn , president and chief executive officer of Cotton Inc. , which represents cotton producers .
`` I do n't know { Mr. Phillips } all that well .
I have n't seen or talked to him in several years .
And some analysts questioned whether Mr. Phillips would have the skills Ogilvy needs to turn the agency around .
While the agency has done well in many parts of the world , its flagship New York office has had a dismal track record recently ; it has won few new accounts while losing big ones , including Maxwell House .
`` I think { Mr. Phillips } is going to need some help .
I think they need creative leadership , and I do n't think they have it , '' said Emma Hill , an analyst with Wertheim & Co .
Ogilvy & Mather 's top creative executive , Norman Berry , left the agency earlier this year .
`` Norm Berry was a creative inspiration at the company , and nobody has filled that void , '' said Ms. Hill .
But other analysts said that having Mr. Phillips succeed Mr. Roman would make for a smooth transition .
`` Graham Phillips has been there a long time , knows the culture well , is aggressive , and apparently gets along well with '' Mr. Sorrell , said Andrew Wallach , an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert .
`` It 's probably a reasonable transition .
Hopefully , he 'll be the answer to the problems they 've had in New York .
Sale of Saatchi Unit Close
Computer Sciences Corp. , El Segundo , Calif. , said it is close to making final an agreement to buy Cleveland Consulting Associates from Saatchi & Saatchi
Computer Sciences would n't disclose the proposed purchase price for Cleveland Consulting , which counsels companies on logistics and supply .
But David Lord , managing editor of Consultants News , an industry publication based in Fitzwilliam , N.H. , said an industry standard would suggest a purchase price of between one and two times Cleveland Consulting 's approximately $ 15 million annual revenue .
Both Saatchi & Saatchi , which announced its intention to sell off most of its consulting business in June , and Cleveland Consulting declined to comment on the proposed sale .

Japan 's Daiwa Securities Co. named Masahiro Dozen president .
Mr. Dozen succeeds Sadakane Doi , who will become vice chairman .
Yoshitoki Chino retains his title of chairman of Daiwa , Japan 's second-largest securities firm .
In Japanese firms , the president usually is in charge of day-to-day operations , while the chairman 's role is more a ceremonial one .
The title of chief executive officer is n't used .
While people within Daiwa , particularly internationalists , expected that Mr. Dozen , 52 , would eventually become Daiwa 's president , the speed of his promotion surprised many .
It was only earlier this year that the jovial , easygoing executive -- he likes to joke with Americans about how his name is synonymous with twelve -- was appointed deputy president .
Mr. Dozen is taking over the reins of a securities company
that does very well in its domestic market but that is still seeking to realize its potential in global investment banking and securities dealing .
Daiwa is one of the world 's largest securities firms .
As of March 31 , the Daiwa group had shareholder equity of 801.21 billion yen ( $ 5.64 billion ) .
For the six months ended Sept. 30 , Daiwa reported unconsolidated ( parent company ) net income of 79.03 billion yen ( $ 556.5 million ) on revenue of 332.38 billion yen ( $ 2.34 billion ) .
Both
figures were record highs .
Several observers interpreted Mr. Dozen 's appointment as an attempt by Daiwa to make its international operations more profitable while preparing the firm for the effects of the continuing deregulation of Japan 's domestic markets , which should mean increased competition .
All of Japan 's so-called Big Four securities firms -- Nomura Securities Co. Ltd. , the world 's largest , Nikko Securities Co. Ltd. , Yamaichi Securities Co. Ltd. and Daiwa -- have suffered setbacks in their attempts to break into foreign markets .
While they have moved to the fore in underwriting fixed-income securities in the Eurobond market -- mostly for Japanese firms -- they have been only marginally profitable , if at all , in the U.S .
American institutional investors have never had a large appetite for Japanese equities .
And while the Japanese have stepped up their purchases of U.S. shares in the past several months , they have shown themselves in the past to be fickle investors .
At the same time , Daiwa and its brethren have faced stiff competition from well-entrenched American competitors
that have prevented them from building strong links to U.S. corporations and institutional investors .
Mr. Dozen knows these problems firsthand .
When he arrived in the U.S. in 1969 -- the start of an eight-year tour -- he tried selling Japanese yen-denominated bonds to U.S. investors .
`` He made desperate efforts , using the yellow pages from beginning to end , '' said Koji Yoneyama , president of Daiwa 's U.S. unit .
`` But not a single piece of paper was sold .
By his own account , Mr. Dozen did n't do much better with U.S. bonds .
In an interview
a few months ago , he recalled how after some training at Salomon Brothers Inc. , he successfully bid for the opportunity to sell portions of 20 U.S. corporate bond issues .
But he could n't sell any .
`` Japanese stock salesmen selling American bonds ?
Maybe it 's crazy , '' he said .
Mr. Dozen even related the indignity suffered when he and two colleagues went on an overnight fishing expedition off the New Jersey shore and caught nothing .
Upon returning to New York , `` Exhausted , I got into a taxicab , and the woman driver said : ` Americans make better fishermen , ' '' he recalled .
Undaunted , Mr. Dozen said that Daiwa 's goal is to build `` a high-technology oriented international organization with maybe some Japanese flavor to it .
He said that he was particularly interested in his firm gaining expertise in futures , options , mortgaged-backed securities , computerized trading and investment systems as well as mergers and acquisitions .
Mr. Dozen said Daiwa 's strengths were its large capital base , its influential position in the Tokyo market and its links to Japanese corporations and institutional investors .
Mr. Dozen joined Daiwa upon his graduation from Kyoto University in 1959 .
Like many young recruits in Japanese securities firms , he began his career peddling stock to individual investors .
In his climb to the top , Mr. Dozen also headed the company 's stock-exchange division , its fixed-income units and its international operations .
`` He was constantly picking up new things to fill out his experience ; he is very well-balanced , '' said Takuro Isoda , chairman of Daiwa 's U.S. unit in New York .
But it

I suggest that The Wall Street Journal ( as well as other U.S. news publications of like mind ) should put its money where its mouth is : Lend computer equipment to replace that damaged at El Espectador , buy ad space , publish stories under the bylines of El Espectador journalists .
Perhaps an arrangement could be worked out to `` sponsor '' El Espectador journalists and staff by paying for added security in exchange for exclusive stories .
Reward El Espectador 's courage with real support .

This is the year
the negative ad , for years
a secondary presence in most political campaigns , became the main event .
The irony is that the attack commercial , after getting a boost in last year 's presidential campaign , has come of age in an off-off election year with only a few contests scattered across the country .
But in the three leading political contests of 1989 , the negative ads have reached new levels of hostility , raising fears that this kind of mudslinging , empty of significant issues , is ushering in a new era of campaigns without content .
`` Now , '' says Joseph Napolitan , a pioneer in political television , `` the idea is to attack first , last and always .
A trend
that started with the first stirrings of politics , accelerated with the dawn of the television age and became a sometimes-tawdry art form in 1988 , has reached an entirely new stage .
`` To get people 's attention these days , '' says Douglas Bailey , a political consultant , `` your TV ad needs to be bold and entertaining , and , more often than not , that means confrontational .
And , unlike a few years ago , you do n't even have to worry whether the ad is truthful .
In 1989 , as often as not , the principal fights in the major campaigns are prompted by the ads themselves .
Take a look , then , at the main attack commercials
that set the tone for Tuesday 's elections in New York City , New Jersey and Virginia :
New York City : The screen fills with a small , tight facial shot of David Dinkins , Democratic candidate for mayor of New York City .
`` David Dinkins failed to file his income taxes for four straight years , '' says a disembodied male voice .
And then this television commercial , paid for by Republican Rudolph Giuliani 's campaign and produced by Roger Ailes , the master of negative TV ads , really gets down to business .
Mr. Dinkins , the ad charges , also failed to report his campaign contributions accurately , hid his links to a failing insurance company and paid a convicted kidnapper `` through a phony organization with no members , no receipts and no office .
`` David Dinkins , '' says the kicker , `` Why does he always wait until he 's caught ?
`` Nasty innuendoes , '' says John Siegal , Mr. Dinkins 's issues director , `` designed to prosecute a case of political corruption
that simply does n't exist .
Stung by the Giuliani ads , Mr. Dinkins 's TV consultants , Robert Shrum and David Doak , finally unleashed a negative ad of their own .
The screen shows two distorted , unrecognizable photos , presumably of two politicians .
`` Compare two candidates for mayor , '' says the announcer .
`` One says he 's for banning cop-killer bullets .
The other has opposed a ban on cop-killer bullets .
One claims he 's pro-choice .
The other has opposed a woman 's right to choose .
`` Funny thing , '' says the kicker , `` both
these candidates are named Rudolph Giuliani .
Who 's telling the truth ?
Everybody -- and nobody .
It 's a classic situation of ads
that are true but not always fully accurate .
Mr. Dinkins did fail to file his income taxes for four years , but he insists he voluntarily admitted the `` oversight '' when he was being considered for a city job .
He was on the board of an insurance company with financial problems , but he insists he made no secret of it .
The city 's Campaign Finance Board has refused to pay Mr. Dinkins $ 95,142 in matching funds because his campaign records are incomplete .
The campaign has blamed these reporting problems on computer errors .
And , says Mr. Dinkins , he did n't know the man his campaign paid for a get-out-the-vote effort had been convicted of kidnapping .
But , say Mr. Dinkins 's managers , he did have an office and his organization did have members .
Mr. Giuliani 's campaign chairman , Peter Powers , says the Dinkins ad is `` deceptive .
'' The other side , he argues , `` knows Giuliani has always been pro-choice , even though he has personal reservations .
They know he is generally opposed to cop-killer bullets , but that he had some reservations about the language in the legislation .
Virginia : Democratic Lt. Gov. Douglas Wilder opened his gubernatorial battle with Republican Marshall Coleman with an abortion commercial produced by Frank Greer that analysts of every political persuasion agree was a tour de force .
Against a shot of Monticello superimposed on an American flag , an announcer talks about the `` strong tradition of freedom and individual liberty '' that Virginians have nurtured for generations .
Then , just as an image of the statue of Thomas Jefferson dissolves from the screen , the announcer continues : `` On the issue of abortion , Marshall Coleman wants to take away your right to choose and give it to the politicians .
That commercial -- which said Mr. Coleman wanted to take away the right of abortion `` even in cases of rape and incest , '' a charge Mr. Coleman denies -- changed the dynamics of the campaign , transforming it , at least in part , into a referendum on abortion .
The ad prompted Mr. Coleman , the former Virginia attorney general , to launch a series of advertisements created by Bob Goodman and designed to shake Mr. Wilder 's support among the very women
who were attracted by the abortion ad .
The Coleman counterattack featured a close-up of a young woman in shadows and the ad suggested that she was recalling an unpleasant courtroom ordeal .
A voice says , `` C'mon , now , do n't you have boyfriends ?
'' Then an announcer interjects : `` It was Douglas Wilder
who introduced a bill to force rape victims age 13 and younger to be interrogated about their private lives by lawyers for accused rapists .
So the next time Mr. Wilder talks about the rights of women , ask him about this law
he tried to pass .
Mr. Wilder did introduce such legislation 17 years ago , but he did so at the request of a constituent , a common legislative technique used by lawmakers .
The legislation
itself noted that it was introduced `` by request , '' and in 1983 Mr. Wilder introduced a bill to protect rape victims from unfounded interrogation .
`` People have grown tired of these ads and Coleman has gotten the stigma of being a negative campaigner , '' says Mark Rozell , a political scientist at Mary Washington College .
`` Wilder has managed to get across the idea that Coleman will say anything to get elected governor and -- more important -- has been able to put the onus for all the negative campaigning on Coleman .
Mr. Coleman said this week that he would devote the remainder of the political season to positive campaigning , but the truce lasted only hours .
By Tuesday night , television stations were carrying new ads featuring Mr. Coleman himself raising questions about Mr. Wilder 's sensitivity to rape victims .
New Jersey : The attacks began when Democratic Rep. James Florio aired an ad featuring a drawing of Pinocchio and a photograph of Mr. Florio 's rival , Republican Rep. Jim Courter .
`` Remember Pinocchio ?
'' says a female voice .
`` Consider Jim Courter .
And then this commercial , produced by Bob Squier , gets down to its own mean and dirty business .
Pictures of rusted oil drums swim into focus , and the female voice purrs , `` That hazardous waste on his { Mr. Courter 's } property -- the neighbors are suing for consumer fraud .
'' And the nose on Mr. Courter 's face grows .
The only fraud involved , cry Mr. Courter 's partisans , is the Florio commercial
itself , and so the Courter campaign has responded with its own Pinocchio commercial , produced by Mr. Ailes .
In this one , the screen fills with photographs of both
candidates .
`` Who 's really lying ?
'' asks a female voice .
`` Florio 's lying , '' the voice goes on , because `` the barrel on Courter 's land ... contained heating oil , was cleaned up and caused no pollution .
Mr. Courter 's long nose shrinks while Mr. Florio 's grows .
Stephen Salmore , a political scientist at New Jersey 's Eagleton Institute , says it 's another example of an ad
that 's true but not fully accurate .
Barrels were dumped on the Courter property , a complaint was made , but there is no evidence
the barrels were a serious threat to the environment .
Even so , according to Mr. Salmore , the ad was `` devastating '' because it raised questions about Mr. Courter 's credibility .
But it 's building on a long tradition .
In 1966 , on route to a re-election rout of Democrat Frank O'Connor , GOP Gov. Nelson Rockefeller of New York appeared in person saying , `` If you want to keep the crime rates high , O'Connor is your man .
Lep Group PLC of Britain , which holds a 62.42 % stake in Profit Systems Inc. , said it is considering courses of action
that could result in its having `` active control '' of the company .
In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission , Lep Group said a possible course of action may include acquiring some or all of the Profit Systems shares it does n't already own .
It noted , however , that it
has n't determined any specific terms of a possible transaction .
Lep Group and affiliates currently control 3,513,072 Profit Systems common shares , or 62.42 % , the filing said .
Profit Systems , Valley Stream , N.Y. , is an air freight forwarding concern .
MCI Communications Corp. said it received a $ 12 million contract to provide virtual network services to Woolworth Corp. 's 5,600 corporate and retail sites in the
The contract also provides for advanced billing and network management services .
Woolworth said it expects to expand usage of the MCI services as it adds about 6,000 business locations over the next few years .
American Pioneer Inc. said it agreed in principle to sell its American Pioneer Life Insurance Co. subsidiary to Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc. 's HBJ Insurance Cos. for $ 27 million .
American Pioneer , parent of American Pioneer Savings Bank , said the sale will add capital and reduce the level of investments in subsidiaries for the thrift holding company .
Recently , the boards of both
the parent company and the thrift also voted to suspend dividends on preferred shares of both
companies and convert all preferred into common shares .
The company said the move was necessary to meet capital requirements .
The transaction is subject to execution of a definitive purchase agreement and approval by various regulatory agencies , including the insurance departments of the states of Florida and Indiana , the company said .
In the second quarter , American Pioneer reported a loss of $ 7.3 million , compared with net income of $ 1.1 million
a year earlier .
The banking operation had a loss of $ 8.7 million in the second quarter , largely because of problem real-estate loans , while the insurance operations earned $ 884,000 .
Sanwa Shutter Corp. said its affiliated company in Malaysia , established this April , will begin manufacturing steel doors Wednesday .
Its partner in the joint venture is Sin Kean Boon Metal Industries , Penang , Malaysia .
Company officials said the new company , Sin Kean Boon-Sanwa ( J.V .
) is capitalized at the equivalent of 54 million yen ( $ 381,000 ) .
The Japanese concern has a 40 % stake , while the local partner has a 60 % stake .
The new company was created to meet growing demand for steel doors , concurrent with increasing local concern about fire prevention , the company said .
The head of British Satellite Broadcasting Ltd. said he hopes to raise about # 450 million ( $ 711 million ) before the satellite-TV venture makes its delayed debut next spring -- with a major chunk coming from new investors .
`` We 'll raise it through bank loans .
We 'll raise it through { new } equity .
And we 'll raise it through existing shareholders '' as well as through junk bonds , said Anthony Simonds-Gooding , the private consortium 's chief executive .
He said he believes the bank loan , to be arranged by February , will supply about half of the financing .
British Satellite , which already has raised # 423.5 million from 10 backers , initially expected to seek an additional # 400 million .
Mr. Simonds-Gooding said the additional financing may leave British Satellite owned by about 20 investors , including Australian entrepreneur Alan Bond , whose nearly 36 % stake would be reduced to as little as 20 % .
Bond Corp. , British Satellite 's biggest investor , would like to withdraw from the satellite-TV consortium , and analysts have speculated Hollywood studios might buy the Bond stake .
But Mr. Simonds-Gooding said he is n't talking to any studios about investing .
Besides Bond Corp. , British Satellite 's other backers include Pearson PLC , Reed International PLC and Granada Group PLC .
The consortium faced a setback in May when technical problems forced it to postpone the September launch until next spring .
Continued uncertainty about the timing of the consortium 's debut could make it hard to find a # 450 million cash injection .
Mr. Simonds-Gooding conceded that British Satellite 's potential U.K. lenders `` are saying , ` When you 're on the air , you 'll
{ actually } get the money .
' '' The bankers also insist that the loans depend on the consortium raising more money from new and existing backers .
British Satellite today is unveiling
a # 30 million advertising and promotional drive for the consortium 's planned five channels of movies , sports , entertainment and news shows .
As part of the drive , the first 50,000 viewers
who put up # 10 each will get a package valued at # 170 -- including a satellite receiving dish , equipment installation and a three-month subscription to its pay-movie service .
British Satellite faces competition from Sky Television , a satellite-TV venture begun last February and owned by Rupert Murdoch 's News Corp .
The rivals currently are locked in a costly bidding contest for Hollywood film rights .
New England Electric System bowed out of the bidding for Public Service Co. of New Hampshire , saying that the risks were too high and the potential payoff too far in the future to justify a higher offer .
The move leaves United Illuminating Co. and Northeast Utilities as the remaining outside bidders for PS of New Hampshire , which also has proposed an internal reorganization plan in Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings under which
it would remain an independent company .
New England Electric , based in Westborough , Mass. , had offered $ 2 billion to acquire PS of New Hampshire , well below the $ 2.29 billion value United Illuminating places on its bid and the $ 2.25 billion Northeast says its bid is worth .
United Illuminating is based in New Haven , Conn. , and Northeast is based in Hartford , Conn .
PS of New Hampshire , Manchester , N.H. , values its internal reorganization plan at about $ 2.2 billion .
John Rowe , president and chief executive officer of New England Electric , said the company 's return on equity could suffer if it made a higher bid and its forecasts related to PS of New Hampshire -- such as growth in electricity demand and improved operating efficiencies -- did n't come true .
`` When we evaluated raising our bid , the risks seemed substantial and persistent over the next five years , and the rewards seemed a long way out .
That got hard to take , '' he added .
Mr. Rowe also noted that political concerns also worried New England Electric .
No matter
who owns PS of New Hampshire , after it emerges from bankruptcy proceedings its rates will be among the highest in the nation , he said .
`` That attracts attention ...
it was just another
one of the risk factors '' that led to the company 's decision to withdraw from the bidding , he added .
Wilbur Ross Jr. of Rothschild Inc. , the financial adviser to the troubled company 's equity holders , said the withdrawal of New England Electric might speed up the reorganization process .
The fact that New England proposed lower rate increases -- 4.8 % over seven years against around 5.5 % boosts proposed by the other two outside bidders -- complicated negotiations with state officials , Mr. Ross asserted .
`` Now the field is less cluttered , '' he added .
Separately , the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission turned down for now a request by Northeast seeking approval of its possible purchase of PS of New Hampshire .
Northeast said it would refile its request and still hopes for an expedited review by the FERC so that it could complete the purchase by next summer if its bid is the one approved by the bankruptcy court .
PS of New Hampshire shares closed yesterday at $ 3.75 , off 25 cents , in New York Stock Exchange composite trading .
Manville Corp. said it offered to buy $ 500 million of its convertible preferred stock from the Manville Personal Injury Settlement Trust in a move
that would improve the trust 's liquidity and reduce the potential number of Manville shares outstanding .
Manville said it made the offer within the past several weeks as part of an effort to improve shareholder value .
It said it would purchase the stock at market price .
Manville and a spokeswoman for the trust said that the two are discussing the proposal but a decision has n't been made .
`` We are considering that offer along with all other alternatives , '' the trust spokeswoman said .
`` We need to look at how to maximize our cash flow to pay our beneficiaries .
The trust , created as part of Manville 's bankruptcy-law reorganization to compensate victims of asbestos-related diseases , owns 7.2 million of the Series
A convertible preferred shares , which are each convertible into 10 Manville common shares .
The trust also owns half of Manville 's 48 million common shares outstanding .
Based on Manville 's closing price yesterday of $ 9.25
a share , Manville 's offer would purchase about 5.4 million of its preferred shares , or about 75 % of the trust 's preferred stock holding .
In addition to the stock and 20 % of Manville 's profits beginning in 1992 , the trust is supposed to receive $ 2.5 billion over its 27-year life .
But it initially was funded with about $ 765 million and may soon face a cash crunch .
As of June 30 , it had settled about 15,000 of 81,000 claims filed and its unpaid claims totaled $ 136 million , a large portion of its $ 268 million in cash and marketable securities .
Since most of its assets are tied to Manville , a forest and building products concern , the trust might also want to diversify its holdings .
As part of its offer , Manville said it requested changes in some covenants between it and the trust to allow Manville to `` reflect a more typical corporate ownership and financial structure .
'' A Manville spokesman would n't elaborate on the proposed changes .
But he said they are `` to a large degree , housekeeping , '' although some may generate some disagreement .
Manville said the shares issued to the trust were intended to be sold , as needed , and that Manville has the right of first refusal to buy those shares .
Another fight is brewing between Congress and the Bush administration over how to pay for the savings-and-loan bailout without adding to the federal budget deficit .
In a hearing before the House Ways and Means Committee , the General Accounting Office and the Congressional Budget Office , which
both are arms of Congress , advised the new S&L bailout agency to abandon plans to raise temporary working capital through debt issued from an agency
that would n't be counted on the federal budget .
Officials of the Resolution Trust Corp. have said privately that such a plan was the most likely alternative to raise short-term cash for the bailout .
Instead , the GAO and the Congressional Budget Office said , the RTC should consider using Treasury debt , which is less expensive and subject to oversight by Congress .
The spending could be exempted from meeting deficit-reduction targets in the Gramm-Rudman budget law .
The RTC has projected that it will require between $ 50 billion to $ 100 billion in temporary working capital .
The borrowing to raise these funds would be paid off as assets of sick thrifts are sold .
The new S&L law allows the RTC to issue notes for as much as 85 % of the value of the assets
it holds .
But higher interest rates paid on off-budget debt could add billions to the bailout costs , and would n't be subject to congressional scrutiny , Ways and Means members argued .
`` To allow this massive level of unfettered federal borrowing without prior congressional approval would be irresponsible , '' said Rep. Fortney Stark ( D. , Calif. ) , who has introduced a bill to limit the RTC 's authority to issue debt .
The RTC will have to sell or merge hundreds of insolvent thrifts over the next three years .
The new S&L bailout law allows $ 50 billion to be spent to sell or merge sick S&Ls and their assets , but that is a net cost .
In the meantime , the agency must raise cash to maintain assets , such as real estate , until they can be sold .
Then the short-term debt is paid off through the proceeds of selling the assets .
David Mullins , assistant secretary of the Treasury , said that the working capital is necessary to reduce the final costs of the bailout , by allowing the agency to sell savings and loans without their bad assets , then hold the assets until they can be sold under favorable conditions .
He said it has n't yet been determined how the RTC will raise the cash , but the administration does n't want it to be included on the federal budget , because it would `` distort '' the budget process by requiring either exemptions from Gramm-Rudman or big increases in the budget deficit .
But the worst possibility would be raising no working capital , he said .
`` If working capital financing is not provided , '' he said , `` the RTC may have to slow { S&L sales } or dump acquired assets through fire sales .
Immunex Corp. said its scientists isolated a molecule
which may hold potential as a treatment for disruptions of the immune-system , ranging from organ-transplant rejection , to allergies and asthma .
The molecule is the mouse version of a protein called the interleukin-4 receptor .
IL-4 is a hormone
which directs the growth and function of white blood cells involved in the body 's immune response .
The IL-4 receptor on the surface of such cells receives the hormone 's message to rally the body 's defense .
But in certain conditions such as autoimmune diseases and allergies and transplant rejection , doctors would like to damp the immune response so such cells do n't touch off harmful inflammatory reactions or cell destruction .
A soluble form of the receptor might turn off a specific part of the immune response without general immune suppression , the company said .
The IL-4 receptor is one of five such receptors to be developed and tested by Receptech Corp. , a spinoff of Immunex , through a proposed $ 30 million initial public offering .
Immunex will contract with the spinoff to provide the research , development and initial testing of the new agents .
Immunex will have the option to buy back Receptech shares after five years .

First they get us to buy computers so we can get more information .
Then the computers give us more information than we can ever read .
Now they plan to sell us products
that sift through all the information to give us
what
we really want to know .
The products range from computer-edited , personal newsletters to systems
that sit inside a personal computer and pick stories on selected topics off news wires .
`` Filtered news is what people want , '' says Esther Dyson , editor of Release 1.0 , an industry newsletter
that spots new developments .
`` Most people read 10 times more than necessary in order to find out what
they really need .
Geoffrey Goodfellow , who dropped out of high school back in the 1970s to manage a computer network at a California research firm , says : `` Old network hands have started to turn off the network because they do n't have time to wade through the muck .
'' Mr. Goodfellow has started a Menlo Park , Calif. , company called Anterior Technology
that provides human editors for public electronic networks .
`` I see it as a sewage treatment plant , '' he says .
A new product , NewsEdge , carries five business news wires simultaneously into a user 's computer and beeps and flashes whenever an article appears that is of interest to the user .
The product , developed by Desktop Data Corp. , a new company based in Waltham , Mass. , scans the wires looking for articles
that contain key words specified by the user .
One early user , David Semmel , a Chicago venture capitalist and investor in Desktop Data , says he uses it to track takeover developments .
He says he told NewsEdge to look for stories containing such words as takeover , acquisition , acquire , LBO , tender , merger , junk and halted .
`` I 'm pretty confident I 'm catching everything , '' he says .
NewsEdge is pricey : $ 7,500
a year for a limited version , $ 40,000
a year if the cost of all the news wires is included .
And it works best in high-powered personal computers .
But some investors and consultants
who have tried it are enthusiastic .
Jeffrey Tarter , editor of SoftLetter , a Watertown , Mass. , industry newsletter , says : `` I 've seen a lot of people fooling around on the fringes of filtering information .
This is the first time
I 've seen something
I could imagine a lot of people using .
NewsEdge uses an FM radio band to carry news wires provided by Reuters , McGraw-Hill and Dow Jones & Co. , as well as PR Newswire , which carries corporate press releases .
An FM receiver attached to a user 's personal computer receives the information .
Some organizations have devised their own systems to sort through news wire items as they come in .
George Goodwin , an account manager at Royal Bank of Canada , adapted a Lotus Development Corp. program called Agenda to sort through international news wires .
It automatically selects stories from particular countries for reading by the international bankers responsible for lending in those areas .
For those
who do n't need their personalized information moment by moment , some services are offering overnight newsletters .
Individual Inc. , a new company in Brookline , Mass. , uses filtering technology developed by Cornell University computer scientist Gerard Salton , to automatically produce customized newsletters
it sends electronically to subscribers by 8 a.m.
the next day .
`` We are operating an information refinery
that takes a broad stream of raw data and turns it into actionable knowledge , '' says Yosi Amram , founder and president .
The daily newsletter , which is n't widely available yet , will have a base cost of $ 2,000
a year and provides full text of relevant articles under license agreements with Reuters , McGraw Hill , United Press International , two press release news wires and Japan 's Kyodo news service .
One early user is NEC Corp. 's U.S. printer marketing arm .
`` They want the full press releases on printer announcements by their competition , '' Mr. Amram says .
It also tracks personnel and financial announcements by NEC 's distributors and customers .
Individual Inc. 's technology goes beyond word searches by using a computerized thesaurus .
If a customer asks for stories about `` IBM , '' the computer will also supply stories
that mention `` I.B.M. , International Business Machines , or Big Blue , '' Mr. Amram says .
Moreover , Individual Inc. 's computers can weigh the value of an article based on how closely the story matches the subscriber 's interest area .
It compares the position of key words in the story ; words in the headline or first paragraph get a higher value .
And it calculates how often the words appear in the story compared with how often they appear in the entire data base .
The higher the ratio of hits to total words , the higher the presumed value to the reader .
Pinpoint Information Corp. , Chantilly , Va. , a producer of $ 1,800-a-year personalized newsletters about the computer industry
that started full operation last month , relies on 12 human readers to code news releases by topic in order to select items for each subscriber .
`` The computers find all the key words they can , but the editors confirm every one .
Computer picking is n't perfect , '' says Harvey Golomb , president and founder of Pinpoint .
The humans also write abstracts of articles from some 200 computer industry publications .
Once all the articles are coded and put in a data base , Pinpoint 's computers pick the most relevant for each subscriber and lay them out in a three-to-five-page newsletter format ; each newsletter is sent directly from the computer to the subscriber 's fax machine .
Mr. Golomb says each of his computers can produce and send about 75 unique newsletters
a night .
Many computer network users
who never see news wires would like to sort through their electronic mail automatically .
So-called E-mail is the collection of inter-office memos , gossip , technical data , schedules and directives distributed over local and national computer networks .
`` All these interconnected computers make it difficult to sort out what 's junk and what 's important , '' says Chuck Digate , a former Lotus Development executive
who has started a new company to cope with the problem .
Mr. Digate says his firm , Beyond Inc. , has licensed technology known as Information Lens from Massachusetts Institute of Technology and plans to develop it for commercial use .
The MIT project devised ways for E-mail to be automatically categorized as top priority if it comes from certain designated senders or requires action in the next couple of days .
Mr. Digate says that Beyond will refine the product `` so the message will be smart enough to know to come back and bother you again next week .
'' And if a user is busy , `` he can set it for crisis mode : ` Do n't bother me with reports until Monday .
' ''
A program called Notes , which is under development by Lotus , also is designed to sort E-mail sent within work groups .
One thing
that makes E-mail difficult to sift through is that each item looks the same .
Notes , which is designed for advanced computers that display graphics , allows mail senders to put different logos on their mail .
A daily news briefing from the company librarian , for example , would have a distinctive format on the screen , just as a paper version would have .
`` With E-mail , you do n't have the visual clues of paper , '' says Mr. Tarter , the editor of SoftLetter .
`` With Notes , they 're visually distinct .
Watching Congress sweat and grimace through its annual budget labors , fighting the urge to spend more , we 're reminded of those late-night movies in which
the anguished serial killer turns himself in to police and says , `` Stop me before I kill again .
'' The Members know they 're doing wrong , but they need help to restrain their darker compulsions .
Arkansas Democrat David Pryor spilled his guts on the Senate floor
the other day after he 'd joined the Finance Committee 's early-morning pork-barrel revels : `` I must tell you ...
I come to the floor tonight as one
who ended up with a busload of extraneous matter .
It was nothing more or nothing less than a feeding frenzy .
'' He was turning himself in .
`` Frankly , as I was walking back to get in my car , I heard many , many people ... opening champagne bottles and celebrating individual victories that some of us had accomplished in getting our little deal in the tax bill and winking at this person for slipping this in , '' he said .
`` As I was driving home , I did not feel very good about myself .
We can applaud Mr. Pryor 's moment of epiphany , even as we understand that he and his confreres need restraint lest they kill again .
A good place to start the rehabilitation is a `` legislative line-item veto '' bill now being offered by Indiana Senator Dan Coats .
The Coats bill , which already has 32 Senate co-sponsors , is n't a pure line-item veto because it would apply only to spending bills .
Instead it 's a form of `` enhanced rescission , '' giving a President
a chance to rescind , or strike , specific spending items
that just go too far .
Under the proposal , a President would have a chance twice each year to return a package of `` rescissions '' to the Hill -- once when he proposes his budget and again after Congress disposes .
Congress would have 20 days to reject the package with a 50 % majority , but then a President could veto that rejection .
Congress would then need the usual two-thirds majority to override any veto .
The proposal would restore some discipline erased from the budget process by the 1974 Budget `` Reform '' Act .
Before 1974 , a President could `` impound , '' or refuse to spend , funds appropriated by Congress .
Presidents Kennedy and Johnson were both big users of the impoundment power , but Congress saw its chance against a weakened President Nixon and stripped it away .

a President can still send up spending rescissions , but they 're meaningless unless Congress has a guilty conscience and changes its mind .
This is like asking foxes to feel remorse about chickens , and naturally rescissions are almost never approved .
In 1987 , President Reagan sent 73 rescissions back to the Hill , but only 3 % of the spending total was approved by Congress .
Senator Coats 's proposal would let the proposed spending cuts take place automatically unless Congress acts .
The Members could still try to serve their constituents with special-interest goodies , but the police ( in the form of a President ) would be there with a straitjacket if they really get crazy , as they do now .
Mr. Coats plans to offer his proposal as an amendment to a bill to raise the federal debt limit before the end of the month .
President Bush has endorsed the idea , and at least 50 sitting Senators have voted to support enhanced rescission authority in the past .
We 're told Senator Pryor is n't yet a co-sponsor , but if he and his colleagues are serious about kicking their compulsions , they 'll sign up .
First , the somewhat affected idealism of the 1960s .
Then , the all-too-sincere opportunism of the 1970s and 1980s .
What now ?
To judge from novels
that mirror the contemporary scene , we 're back in the age of anxiety .
Where '60s dropouts professed to scorn middle-class life and ambitious yuppies hoped to leave it far behind as they scaled the upper reaches of success , it now seems that so many people feel they 're slipping between the cracks , that middle-class life is viewed with nostalgia or outright longing .
Lisa Zeidner 's third novel , `` Limited Partnerships '' ( North Point Press , 256 pages , $ 18.95 ) is a stylish , funny and thoughtful look at the way love relationships are affected by the pressures of money , or , more specifically , the lack of it .
Nora Worth and Malcolm DeWitt , 33 and 39 respectively , live together in a townhouse in a transitional Philadelphia neighborhood .
Malcolm , a former film-maker turned architect , has just seen his first big chance at a lucrative commission turn to dust with the arrest of his shady , obnoxious client , a fly-by-night real estate developer .
Nora , who still has artistic aspirations , knows she is lucky to be working as a food stylist , prepping pies , burgers , frosty cold drinks and other comestibles to look as appetizing as possible in front of the camera .
After all , she reasons , `` there were housewives with Nikons and degrees from cooking schools in France
who would kill for her job .
'' But Nora and Malcolm feel trapped .
They seem to be having the `` worst of both
worlds : artistic work with none of art 's integrity and no control over the finished product ; self-employment without fun or profit .
It 's a downbeat , `` thirtysomething '' world , in which
bright , still youngish people are engaged in a glossy version of day labor , doing free-lance , semi-professional work
that brings little satisfaction or security but that they know they should be grateful to do .
Uncertainty dogs
every aspect of their lives .
Malcolm faces bankruptcy and an IRS audit , but Nora finds an extra $ 30,000 in her bank account , suddenly increasing her available funds
some fifteenfold .
While she is wondering whether to live it up , and do something even more dramatic , say get married , her life is further complicated by the reappearance of an old flame , David , a film critic and actor
who always seems to be just on the brink of stardom .
In novels of an earlier vintage , David would have represented excitement and danger ; Malcolm , placid , middle-class security .
The irony in this novel is that neither man represents a `` safe '' middle-class haven : Nora 's decision is between emotional excitement and emotional security , with no firm economic base anywhere .
The characters confront a world in which
it seems increasingly difficult to find a `` middle way '' between the extremes of success and failure , wealth and poverty .
In making Malcolm and Nora such wonderfully representative specimens of their class and generation , Ms. Zeidner has somewhat neglected the task of making them distinctively individual characters .
The humor of the story owes much to the fact that no hearts ( even the characters ' own ) are likely to bleed for the plight of health-food eaters .
But readers may well feel the pangs of recognition .
In any case , the foundering middle classes are n't the only ones in trouble -- or whose troubles provide material for fiction .
`` Rascal Money '' ( Contemporary Books , 412 pages , $ 17.95 ) , a novel by consultant and business analyst Joseph R. Garber , tells the story of an innovative , well-run , widely respected computer manufacturing company called PegaSys as it faces a hostile takeover attempt by AIW , a much smaller corporation
that is so incompetently managed as to constitute a standing joke in the business world .
Patrician , dynamic Scott Thatcher , founder and head of PegaSys , initially finds the takeover threat risible .
But , as he and his skilled team soon discover , they 're up against two factors they had n't counted on : first , a business climate in which
a failing company with few assets and many debts can borrow against the assets of the successful company
it hopes to acquire in order to finance the takeover ; second , that standing behind AIW is a sinister consortium of much bigger , shadier and shrewder foreign interests secretly providing the money and muscle for the deal .
Mr. Garber manages to invest this tale of financial wars with the colorful characters and fast-paced action of a suspense novel .
And like a spy or mystery story , this novel has strong elements of allegory , as the good and evil forces battle it out .
Mr. Garber depicts these moral qualities with the broad brush strokes of a satire
that occasionally descends to the realm of cliched caricatures .
Standard-issue portraits of flaky Californians , snobbish homosexuals and Neanderthal union leaders undermine the force of the author 's perceptions .
Yet the heavy-handedness of the satire also can be effective in a book like this : If the head of AIW were not portrayed as an utterly contemptible , malicious dolt , we would not much care whether his schemes were defeated , and would not be so diverted in the process .

Investors in the over-the-counter market dumped banking and insurance issues , sending the Nasdaq composite index lower for the third consecutive session .
All Nasdaq industry indexes finished lower , with financial issues hit the hardest .
Despite some early computer-guided program buying , the Nasdaq composite fell 1.39 to 451.37 .
The OTC market now has declined in eight of the past 11 sessions .
The Nasdaq bank index fell 5.00 to 432.61 , while the insurance index fell 3.56 to 528.56 , and the `` other finance '' index dropped 3.27 to 529.32 .
The largest financial issues , as measured by the Nasdaq financial index , tumbled 3.23 to
Meanwhile , the index of the 100 biggest non-financial stocks , the Nasdaq 100 , gained 0.47 to 438.15 .
Profit-taking accounted for much of the slide in OTC stock prices , according to David Mills , senior vice president of Boston Company Advisers .
He said many portfolio managers , whose year-end bonuses are tied to annual performance , are selling now rather than risk seeing their gains erode further .
`` The profit locking-in is definitely going on , '' said Mr. Mills , whose firm manages $ 600 million for Boston Co .
Tax-loss sellers , those investors
who sell loss-making stocks so they can deduct their losses from this year 's income , are also getting out , Mr. Mills said .
That 's helping put pressure on both
the market 's winners and its losers .
`` The stocks
that have been the best are having big pullbacks , and the ones
that have been the worst are getting clobbered , '' Mr. Mills said .
He expects the market to sink further and to reach a low sometime next month or in December .
The selling by money managers and individual investors is turning traders bearish as well .
`` We are advising a lot of our clients to make moves
that make sense to them , rather than waiting until the last minute , because things have been so volatile , '' said William Sulya , head of OTC trading at A.G. Edwards & Sons in St. Louis .
Ralph Costanza , head of the OTC trading department at Smith Barney , Harris Upham , said many market players are awaiting some resolution of the current debate over program trading .
Much of the market 's recent volatility has been blamed on this large-scale computerized trading technique
that can send stock prices surging or plummeting in a matter of minutes .
The problem has been particularly damaging to the OTC market , traditionally a base for the small investor .

Two New England banks reported substantial third-quarter net losses , reflecting the continuing woes of the region 's developers and lenders .
One Bancorp , Portland , Maine , buffeted by loan write-downs and expanded loss reserves , reported a net loss of $ 48.5 million , or $ 5.92
In the year-earlier period , the bank holding company reported net income of $ 523,000 , or six cents
Holyoke , Mass.-based Heritage Bancorp , also hurt by the depressed New England real estate market , reported a net loss of $ 8.9 million , or $ 1.22
a share , compared with net income of $ 3 million , or 40 cents
One Bancorp , which had warned that it planned to take a $ 49.8 million loan-loss provision in the third quarter , said it expects things to get worse , but more slowly , in the future .
`` Barring marked and unanticipated declines in real estate values , we expect our growth rates of nonperforming loans to slow , '' Vincent E. Furey Jr. , president and chief executive officer , said .
After taking write-downs of about $ 75 million in the last 12 months , he said the company is in position , `` to address accelerated disposal of problem assets .
One Bancorp 's primary capital-to-asset ratio is 6.6 % after third-quarter charges .
Under federal regulations , a 6 % ratio is the standard .
However , the company said it is n't in compliance with certain standards
it agreed to last fall in connection with two Massachusetts acquisitions .
Mr. Furey said the company is working to restore its capital ratio to regulatory compliance and expects to reach an agreement with regulators during the fourth quarter .
He said he expects a formal written agreement documenting One Bancorp 's plan to reduce problem assets and return to compliance .
The third-quarter loss reflected a $ 49.8 million provision for loan losses and write-downs of $ 8.5 million on foreclosed real estate .
One Bancorp said its loan-loss reserve of $ 59.4 million at Sept. 30 was 2.9 % of loans outstanding and 35 % of $ 170 million in nonperforming loans .
At June 30 , reserves of $ 52.2 million were 2.4 % of loans outstanding and 35 % of $ 150 million in nonperforming loans .
Loan and real-estate write-downs have reduced $ 195 million in nonperforming assets by 28 % from their original loan value , One Bancorp said .
Nonperforming assets consist of $ 170 million in nonperforming loans and $ 25 million in real estate acquired by agreement or foreclosure .
As a result of the losses , stockholders ' equity declined to $ 76.6 million , or $ 9.35
a share , at Sept. 30 , from $ 125.1 million , or $ 15.27
a share , at June 30 .
For the first nine months of 1989 , net losses at One Bancorp totaled $ 74.5 million , or $ 9.12
a share , compared to net income of $ 9.7 million , or $ 1.13
a share , in the year-earlier period .
Heritage Bancorp said it added $ 17 million to its loan-loss reserve , making the reserve $ 24.7 million or 1.6 % of total loans and 35 % of nonperforming loans .
Nonperforming loans increased from $ 32.2 million as of June 30 , 1988 , to $ 69.6 million as of Sept. 30 , 1989 .
Assets at Sept. 30 totaled $ 1.73 billion .
Chairman Richard B. Covell said he expects that Heritage will rebound in the fourth quarter and return to a positive mode of operation in 1990 .
`` We are aggressively pursuing workout strategies with respect to nonperforming assets in an effort to resolve these problems as expeditiously as possible , while simultaneously minimizing losses to the company , '' he said .
For the nine months , Heritage reported a net loss of $ 10.9 million , or $ 1.49
a share , compared to net income of $ 8.3 million , or $ 1.12
a share .

European Community employers fear that the EC Commission 's plans for a `` charter of fundamental social rights '' is a danger to industrial competitiveness .
`` We do n't want Brussels deciding conditions for workers unless they are necessary and useful , '' said Zygmunt Tyszkiewicz , secretary general of the employers ' confederation Unice .
Unice -- an acronym for the Union of Industrial and Employers ' Confederations of Europe -- fears that the charter will force EC countries to adopt a single pattern in labor relations .
Workers and management , Mr. Tyszkiewicz said , would lose the `` flexibility and diversity '' that has so far allowed them to adapt to local conditions and traditions .
The British government also strongly opposes the charter in its current form .
It argues , as does Unice , that labor relations are best left to be regulated at the national level .
France will propose a slightly watered-down version of the charter to be discussed by EC social-affairs ministers on Monday , officials said .
But the cosmetic changes are n't expected to win over Britain .
`` We still have serious differences with the text , '' a British official said , because it provides for a `` regulation of the labor market .
Mr. Tyszkiewicz said the charter would put poorer EC countries such as Spain , Greece and Portugal at a disadvantage .
It would force these countries to introduce minimum standards for pay and working hours , and provide for collective bargaining and worker `` participation '' in major corporate decisions .
This , he warned , would prevent these countries from bridging the difference with their richer EC brethren .
Indeed , lower wages -- in Greece , they are a third of the EC average -- are n't enough to offset higher transport costs and lower productivity in the southern countries .
Increasing labor costs , Mr. Tyszkiewicz argued , would only put the countries at a further disadvantage in competing in the barrier-free EC market planned for after 1992 .
But the Unice official said that producing a charter acceptable to both Britain and European industry is n't an unattainable goal .
The charter would just have to be restricted to a list of workers ' fundamental rights , without seeking to impose any norms .
A key provision in the current version of the charter would give the commission
a mandate to produce an `` action program '' detailing on what points EC member states would be required to comply with the goals set out in the charter .
This provision lies at the heart of the British and Unice fears of `` social engineering '' by the commission .
One possible political solution , an EC official said , would be for the commission to present the action program in late November , before the adoption of the charter at a summit of EC governments on Dec. 8 and 9 .
This would leave Britain free to adopt the charter after having rebutted the action program .
The charter was approved by the EC Commission on Sept. 21 .
France 's Socialist government , which currently holds the council 's rotating presidency , is committed to having the charter adopted by all 12 EC states before the end of 1989 -- the bicentennial of the French revolution and its `` Universal Declaration of Human Rights .

Two leading constitutional-law experts said President Bush does n't have the legal authority to exercise a line-item veto .
Professors Philip Kurland of the University of Chicago and Laurence Tribe of Harvard Law School said any effort by President Bush to claim authority for a line-item veto would contradict the text of the Constitution and the intent of its authors , as well as the views of previous presidents .
A line-item veto is a procedure
that would allow a president to veto part of a big congressional spending bill without having to scuttle the entire measure .
Mr. Bush has said he would like to be able to use this procedure .
A White House spokesman said last week that the president is considering declaring that the Constitution implicitly gives him
the authority for a line-item veto to provoke a test case .
But the two legal experts , responding to an inquiry by Sen. Edward Kennedy ( D. , Mass. ) , wrote in a joint letter that the president `` lacks the constitutional authority to exercise a line-item veto .
'' The two professors represent different ends of the political spectrum -- Mr. Kurland is a conservative and Mr. Tribe is a liberal .
The two professors said the Constitution authorizes the president to veto entire bills , not partial measures .
Moreover , they said the first appropriations bill passed 200 years ago covered many different items , and there was no discussion of a line-item veto .
They also said that more than a dozen presidents have called for line-item veto authority since the Civil War , and `` all have shared the view that such lawmaking power is beyond the reach '' of the president .
Sen. Kennedy said in a separate statement that he supports legislation to give the president line-item veto power , but that it would be a `` reckless course of action '' for President Bush to claim the authority without congressional approval .
The head of the nation 's largest car-dealers group is telling dealers to `` just say no '' when auto makers pressure them to stockpile cars on their lots .
In an open letter
that will run today in the trade journal Automotive News , Ron Tonkin , president of the National Car Dealers Association , says dealers should cut their inventories to no more than half the level traditionally considered desirable .
Mr. Tonkin , who has been feuding with the Big Three since he took office earlier this year , said that with half of the nation 's dealers losing money or breaking even , it was time for `` emergency action .
U.S. car dealers had an average of 59 days ' supply of cars in their lots at the end of September , according to Ward 's Automotive Reports .
But Mr. Tonkin said dealers should slash stocks to between 15 and 30 days to reduce the costs of financing inventory .
His message is getting a chilly reception in Detroit , where the Big Three auto makers are already being forced to close plants because of soft sales and reduced dealer orders .
Even before Mr. Tonkin 's broadside , some large dealers said they were cutting inventories .
Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. representatives criticized Mr. Tonkin 's plan as unworkable .
It `` is going to sound neat to the dealer except when his 15-day car supply does n't include the bright red one that the lady wants to buy and she goes up the street to buy one , '' a Chrysler spokesman said .
Telerate Inc. , which has rejected an $ 18-a-share tender offer by Dow Jones & Co. for the 33 % of Telerate that Dow Jones does n't already own , said the two companies began talks yesterday to try to negotiate a friendly transaction .
However , the talks did n't produce any changes in the $ 576 million Dow Jones offer , which
a committee of Telerate 's two independent directors has rejected as inadequate .
Peter Skinner , vice president and corporate general counsel for Dow Jones , said yesterday 's talks took place
both on the telephone and in person .
`` We discussed the bid , but Dow Jones and its board of directors believe the bid is full and fair , '' Mr. Skinner said .
He said no future talks are currently scheduled , but added that Dow Jones representatives will meet again with Telerate officials if Telerate seeks a meeting .
Telerate disclosed the opening of negotiations in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission , which said that `` there can be no assurance that such negotiations will continue or will result in revised terms
that will be satisfactory to the special committee .
The talks followed an effort by Telerate to place a strongly worded advertisement attacking the Dow Jones offer in yesterday 's editions of The Wall Street Journal , according to two people familiar with Telerate .
After Telerate submitted its ad to the Journal Wednesday , the people said , a lawyer for Dow Jones telephoned a Telerate lawyer .
Soon thereafter , Warren H. Phillips , chairman of Dow Jones , telephoned Neil S. Hirsch , chairman of Telerate .
As a result of the conversations , the people said , Telerate decided not to run the ad yesterday , and Dow Jones agreed to meet with Telerate .
Mr. Skinner said that Dow Jones executives had been told that the ad would be submitted by Telerate and were advised of its content .
The Dow Jones executives indicated to Telerate executives that such an ad would not be `` helpful , '' Mr. Skinner said , and Telerate decided not to run the ad .
A spokesman for Telerate declined to elaborate on Telerate 's filing with the SEC .
Telerate stock rose 87.5 cents to close at $ 20.50 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday .
Dow Jones fell 62.5 cents to close at $ 36.625 .
Many of Wall Street 's takeover-stock speculators bought relatively large positions in Telerate stock after Dow Jones announced its tender offer on Sept. 21 .
The traders are betting Dow Jones will increase its $ 18-a-share offer in order to acquire full ownership of Telerate , an electronic distributor of financial-market information .
Several takeover stock traders said yesterday they expect Dow Jones to offer at least $ 21 .
Some analysts , investment bankers and institutional investors
who have studied Telerate have said they believe the company could fetch between $ 25 and $ 30
a share if it were put up for auction .
But the takeover stock traders , who declined to be identified , said they believe it is unrealistic to expect Dow Jones will pay that much , considering it already owns about 67 % of Telerate .
Bruce Thorp , an analyst at Philadelphia-based Provident National Bank , said Dow Jones 's tender offer reflects a typical premium for the purchase of a remaining minority stake .
He thinks Dow Jones will end up paying $ 20 or $ 21
a share for Telerate .
`` The offer will be sweetened , not because it has to be , but because it will make for a smoother transaction , '' Mr. Thorp said .
`` Dow Jones could bludgeon its way through the process and get it for less , but they wo n't do that .
Dow Jones is not going to squeeze as hard as it could .
Dow Jones declined to comment on Mr. Thorp 's speculation .
Telerate 's proposed ad , headlined `` What Now , Dow Jones ? '' was in the form of a letter to Dow Jones directors .
`` How can a company of Dow Jones 's reputation persist in a coercive attempt to squeeze out the minority shareholders of Telerate at a low-ball price of $ 18
a share ? '' the ad asked .
A copy of the ad was obtained from a person familiar with Telerate .
`` We are forced to consider Dow Jones 's actions as hostile -- to Telerate 's shareholders , management , and employees , '' the ad said .
It was signed by Mr. Hirsch , three other Telerate directors
who are employees of Telerate , and two outside directors .
People familiar with Telerate said the ad was intended to encourage Dow Jones to begin negotiations and was submitted to the Journal for that reason .
`` We could have run it in the New York Times , '' one person familiar with Telerate said .
As evidence of their contention that the current Dow Jones offer is too low , takeover-stock speculators pointed to an SEC filing by Dow Jones disclosing that Dow Jones managers had proposed offering $ 19
However , that proposal was overruled by Dow Jones 's board , which decided to offer $ 18
After the Telerate special committee rejected the Dow Jones offer as inadequate , Mr. Phillips of Dow Jones said , `` We are proceeding with our $ 18-a-share offer and continue to believe that the offer is fair to all Telerate stockholders .
'' The offer is scheduled to expire Nov. 3 .
Separately , a hearing is scheduled for Monday in Delaware Chancery Court on a motion by certain Telerate shareholders seeking a court order to block the Dow Jones tender offer .
Dow Jones paid between $ 10 and $ 15
a share for most of the 63.6 million Telerate shares
it owns .
The shares were purchased in various transactions , starting in August 1985 .
However , Dow Jones paid $ 28.75
a share for one block of about 10.5 million Telerate shares in September 1987 .
That price represented a premium of 16.8 % above the then-market price of Telerate shares .
In addition to The Wall Street Journal , Dow Jones publishes Barron 's , various community newspapers , and operates financial news services and computer databases .
Steel jackets of a type
that may have prevented collapse of the columns of a 1.5-mile stretch of the Nimitz Freeway had been installed on at least a small test section of the double-decker highway last year by California 's Department of Transportation , employees familiar with the project say .
The test project -- which reportedly survived Tuesday 's earthquake -- was a prelude to a state plan to retrofit that critical section of the freeway with the steel casings .
State engineers have made a preliminary finding that it was failure of the concrete columns , wrenched and separated from the double-decker roadbed , that was responsible for the collapse .
The failure in Oakland of the freeway segment known as the Cypress structure was the deadliest aspect of the quake , although officials were hopeful yesterday that the death toll
there might be significantly lower than the 250 initially feared .
Sorting out the wreckage is expected to take several days .
Red tractors gingerly picked at the rubble while jackhammers tried to break up some of the massive slabs of concrete .
Giant yellow cranes were wheeled up alongside the collapsed segment , preparing to lift off chunks of the debris .
In Sacramento , a transportation department spokesman said he could n't immediately confirm or deny existence of the test work .
However , he asserted that the department had n't mastered the technology needed to retrofit the entire Cypress structure .
Moreover , other officials noted , snafus in transportation funding that the state has experienced over the years may have restricted the availability of funds for such a retrofitting , even if it were technologically feasible .
Knowledgeable employees said the retrofitting , which had n't yet been budgeted , was part of a planned , three-stage reinforcement of the Cypress structure begun by the California transportation department several years ago .
The Cypress reinforcement project
itself was part of an annual effort to shore up structures believed vulnerable to earthquakes .
The state began such work after a 1971 tremblor in Southern California , when numerous bridges collapsed .
`` We had just finished phase two '' of the Cypress project
that involved installing a series of retaining cables designed to prevent sections of the roadway from separating as a result of seismic shock , a state DOT engineer said .
After completing installation of the jackets on `` one frame '' of the freeway last year , the state DOT had sent the project over to its Sacramento engineers to draw up a final design .
Knowledgeable employees said the project had been stymied somewhat by `` the difficulty of designing '' the jackets .
The procedure involves encasing the concrete columns with steel , then connecting them more securely to the double-decker roadbed .
The employees also said the project may have been snagged by budgetary concerns .
One preliminary estimate put the retrofitting cost at as much as $ 50 million .
The collapse of the span has provoked surprise and anger among state officials .
Gov. George Deukmejian , who said he had been assured by state transportation officials that the structure could withstand an even larger quake , called for an immediate investigation .
`` I want to know who made the decision that it was safe for 186,000 people to use every day , '' said Richard Katz , a state legislator
who is chairman of the California Assembly 's transportation committee .
He said he would convene hearings within two weeks .
The Cypress structure opened in June 1957 , and as such , like many buildings in the San Francisco Bay area , does not meet current building codes requiring considerably more steel support .
The northern piers of the span lie in estuarian deposits
that were of a type to have liquefied easily during the 1906 quake .
Transportation department officials , however , said they were as surprised as anyone by the Cypress destruction .
They said previous earthquakes suggested that multiple-column viaducts would stand up well , although they were working on ways to bolster them .
`` Unfortunately , there is only one laboratory for developing techniques to withstand earthquakes , and that is an earthquake , '' said Burch Bachtold , San Francisco district director for the transportation department .
He said : `` We know of no technology
that exists anywhere in the world
that would allow us to '' reinforce the columns .

Renaissance , a Cincinnati-based money manager , began buying stocks again this week with half of the $ 1.8 billion that it oversees for clients , according to people familiar with the firm 's revised strategy .
It was the first time since January that Renaissance has thought stocks are worth owning .
Renaissance declined to confirm the move , but its stock purchases were thought to have begun Tuesday , timed to coincide with the maturity
this week of Treasury bills owned by the firm .
The other half of its portfolio is expected to remain invested in Treasury bills for the time being .
Wall Street executives said they believed that Renaissance 's $ 900 million buy program was carried out by PaineWebber Inc .
As reported , PaineWebber bought shares Tuesday as part of a customer strategy shift , although the broker 's client was said then to have been Japanese .
Yesterday , PaineWebber declined comment .
When it owns stocks , Renaissance 's portfolio typically is composed of about 60 large-capitalization issues ; to make buy or sell moves , the firm solicits Wall Street brokerage houses a day or so in advance , looking for the best package price to carry out the trades .
The broker winning the business does n't charge commissions , but instead profits by buying or selling for less than the overall package price .
That puts the broker at risk if it 's trying to buy stock in a rising market .
In Tuesday 's gyrating session , the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 80 points early in the day , but finished with less than a four-point loss .
