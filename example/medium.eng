where exactly where you in kigali ?
are you still with shumbusho ?
how many children were you in your family ?
we were ... the boys were 4 plus shumbusho , that makes it 5 and my little sister ngirabakunzi and i.
if we go back to 1994 ... can you remember exactly how you left kibuye for gisenyi ? was it as a consequence of the war ?
no , it was n't because of the war . i left home before the war started . i was brought up in gisenyi because that 's where my mom was born . i was mainly brought up in her family .
did any of your neighbours in gisenyi die when the inkotanyis attacked in 1990 ?
not among our neighbours in gisenyi . not where i was living . but people i know of people who died in kayove where mom was from .
you told us your mom 's family and your cousins lived in kayove . who were you living with in gisenyi ?
i was living with mother 's cousin in gisenyi .
how did you end up in kigali ? we did n't understand it well ...
i had a white boyfriend . i used to come and visit him but i would also bring some things to sell . i would stay at maria 's until i finish sellingmy things then i would go back home .
you told us the war broke up when you had been in kigali for 3 days , you also said that there 's a time you were with the child called micheveux for about 2 weeks , i did n't quite undertand that part .
have you heard anything giramata , the one you were hiding with at maria 's ?
mama giramata survived together with her husband and children . but i have never heard anything about melanie . i never saw her again after the day i was with her in the bush .
were helene and maria sisters ?
yes helene was maria 's younger sister .
and helene kept on looking for ways to hide you ...
yes , she is the one who helped me to get all the people who hid me because i did n't know anyone else in kigali apart from helene and her sister . meaning that if helene did n't help me find all those people , i would not have survived .
was she married ?
what about the child called mutoni you met at the orphanage , did you see her again ?
have you been able to bury in respect some of your people ?
how did you manage to face life after the war after all the difficulties you went through plus the fact that shumbusho was seriously disturbed by everything he had gone through ? how did you manage to face such a life ?
among the neighbours who killed your family , are there some who participated openly and never went to jail ?
the politic of the government consists in releasing the people who have acknowledged their crimes so they can live with the rwandan nation again and be united with them all over again . what do you think of that ? and how do you think things should be ?
the fact that they did n't make the decision on their own , it 's not something they do after giving it much thought shows that it 's something they could easily do again . are n't the people who killed my grandfather the same ones who killed my brother ? it was many years ago , he was killed in 1959 . meaning that they never apologized for what they did , they never acknowledged that killing their neighbours for no reason was wrong . so , it 's all pointless and they 'll do it again .
you said that imprisoning them is a waste for the country . do you believe the country will gain when they are free ? do you think it will be of any use for the country ?
what do you think of the lives of the survivors in this country ?
how do you feel about gacaca , unity and reconciliation ?
today march 21 , 2007 , we are here at the head office of avega in the eastern province with mujawamariya francoise , one of the people supported by avega . we are going to have a discussion with her and she will tell her story . the story of what she went through during the genocide . mujawamariya francoise you could start up with introducing yourself ?
my name is mujawamariya francoise and i was born in gashirabwoba , former gisumu .
when the genocide happened ... we all know it happened all across rwanda ... you , with your family in gisumu , would you tell us in detail how the genocide affected you ? where did it find you ? how many people made your family ? what happened to you ?
the first people who raped you , the interahamwe militia ... did you know any of them ? how would you describe them ?
they were two and they came from karengera . i did n't know them .
the born @-@ again soldier you told us about , is he the one that helped you get to the congelese woman ?
no . he just took me up to the road and he told me to go . i went i met the congolese woman on my way and when i reached rusizi river , we crossed it together . that man only took me up to the road but we did n't go all the way together .
but you did n't tell us about the death of your parents or your relatives . how were they killed ? where did they throw them ? could you try to tell us about that ?
my dad after managing to reach the football court of gashirabwoba got shot by some policemen and soldiers from cyangugu . that 's how he died . my mum and my siblings were killed with machetes at the hospital of bushenge .
does that mean that from your whole family and all the people you lived with , you are the only survivor ?
yes .
what happened in nyabushishi refugee camp ? we would like you to continue telling us how life was like went so we can wrap up .
after some time in the camp in nyabushishi ... i had a brother who was in the rpf who came to know that i was in nyabushishi . he came and took me where he was staying in butare . we stayed together in butare but after sometimes he died in a motorcycle crash . after he died i returned to cyangugu and avega started to help me . that 's how i came back .
we would like you to explain in detail from the time you left butare how avega came to know about you ... of course you were admitted in bushenge hospital but i do n't avega knew you out of the blue ! it must have happened in a way . describe in detail how your life was like from the time the genocide started until late when it ended .
how did the people at the tribunal know about you ? did they know you before ?
in fact those people were working on rights abuses and ... in the area where i lived ... they asked people and they were told that i was at the hospital . so they came to collect my testimony but ... i was so sick then that i could n't even speak but later , i was able to tell them my story . that 's how they came .
during that time at the hospital it 's all after being raped . did you ever go to the hospital to be tested for hiv ?
i got tested during my admission period and that 's how i found out i was infected with hiv .
francoise , i know it is not something easy but i would like you to explain ... i guess when you were very sick , you could think and ... after realizing that it was the result of the raped that you went through during the genocide ... i mean how did you receive the fact of being infected with aids ?
i had never been with a man before the genocide so i immediately realized that i contracted it during the genocide . immediately after figuring that out i was given medication because i had the right stage for the cure . i started taking them at king faycal hospital where i was ... even though it was hard i had to accept it .
sorry but you have to be strong . i wanted to ask you ... please try to be strong and bare with m but ... there is not another way . i want to ask if there is anyone else other than avega who has supported you after the genocide .
there is no one .
maybe before i go into details about avega and how they help you . the genocide happened and it took away your relatives and you were raped ... the question that i would like to ask you is @: is there not anyone apart from the men who raped you that were involved in the killings of your relatives that you recognized ?
i did n't even know how they died because i was n't with them . we were all scattered and i was n't with them . i were with them i would have also been killed .
were you able to know where they threw them at least ? that could have helped burying them ?
yes they buried them at the memorial site of gashirabwoba . my dad was drowned into the kivu lake . in fact all the people who were shot at the football court were thrown into the kivu .
today your neighbours from where you used to live ... how is life like together today ? at least after the genocide when you go there , do you ever meet with people who used to live nearby ?
no i can not return there . i can not be able to talk to them .
now that the genocide is over , there are many consequences after the genocide like misery . your life after the genocide ... it is clear that it was not good but you told us that avega tried to help you as much as they could . so what can you tell us ? with the help from avega , do you sometimes feel that it is enough ? or do you feel like the help is kills more than it can save the situation ? can you tell us about that ?
because avega supports many people , the support it gives to individuals can not satisfy them . for people like me who are also on medication , it does n't help because we have lost of needs .
now i would like you to share your opinion ... what kind of advice would you give ? is it to increase the capacity of avega or to look for other organizations to help you ?
increasing avega 's capacity would be much better because ... or you could find other organizations if you can . avega does the best they can and there 's nothing negative that they do . the only problem is that the support is very small and a lot of people need it . for instance , we have an association that has almost ninety people . all those people have their eyes on avega and it is clear to see that it does n't help them much .
what 's the name of that association ?
duhozanye .
could you repeat for us in detail what this association does ? who are the members ?
there are many people . i can n't remember their names ... they invited the lady who is the president the association but i do n't know if she came . it 's an association of patients . it does n't have enough support though .
is there nothing else apart from the fact that the problems are not just yours but meeting with your friends ... you might come up with an idea because it is clear that if it is an association of a lot of people , there are times you might be able to discuss and exchange ideas . would you try and tell us about life in that association if there is any help that it provides to you other than knowing that you are not the only one with problems .
if we ever get support , i am sure that we can find what to do . that 's the good thing about this association ... we would do it together .
the message i would tell them is that they should n't give up . i do n't think there is anything else although patience is not easy especially when you do n't have good welfare .
what they did is a lot . children were able to go to school ; some people were housed though it 's a few of them because housing and poverty are still the major problems . i do n't know ...
i do n't know if there is anything you would like to add to this discussion that we had but if there is something i did n't ask that you would like to say , whatever it is ... there is another question before you say something , i would like to ask you ... although you have all these problems ... problems of health ... do you still have hope in life ?
hope ... can you have hope in life when you realize that your current life is not good ? i do n't have any hope ! i do n't even have a place i can call home . avega was going to buy for me a house but because the funders stopped their support ... i do n't have any hope today .
it 's now thirteen years after the genocide and obviously life gets more and more challenging but do you believe that at some point , all these problems will end ? and that people will have a better life ?
where would one get that hope ? living conditions are even getting more challenging ... maybe if you could do something , i think that would be help somehow .
if not individuals , what do you think the government of rwanda should do ? especially for those supported by avega or even others who faced similar problems during the war [ genocide ] .
most especially i think the government of rwanda should take care of us because if they do n't , no one else will . we can n't wait for foreigners when the government , aware what happened to us does n't take care of us as it should !
in conclusion is there anything you would like to say that i did n't ask or you would want to tell us ?
what ... i would like to tell you is that you could try and see if you could find a way to help us to improve our lives at least as we are on medication ... so we can get food and all the other things that are related to that . then we can really feel that there are people who empathize with our sorrow
we would like you to introduce yourself to us as we are about to talk about what happened in the genocide .
my names are murebwayire josephine i live in kimironko in the sector of nyagatovu in the district of gasabo .
we would like you to tell us about your life with your family before the genocide , how big was your family ?
explain to us and tell us how big your family was ; your children , your husband and then after try and give us an idea or paint an image for us on how your life was before the genocide .
before the genocide we lived in a place called masoro at that time it was called ndera sector .
commune rubungo is where we lived , nowadays it 's called gasabo district , i had a husband with six children .
three boys and three girls , we also had a child that we had adopted , my husband 's niece .
we were living in harmony , we had a nice house , our standard of life was good , and my husband was working .
my children were growing up and were in secondary school , the oldest was in senior four and the youngest was in primary four .
we also lived with my two brothers .
one had just gotten married and he lived near us , we were a big nice family , the genocide rally started in 1990 , that 's when we heard that the inkotanyi [ rpf ] had attacked .
they said they came from byumba on the 1st of october 1990 , we all did n't know what it was when we heard about it with our neighbours .
on the 7th of october 1990 that 's when they came to arrest my husband saying he was a spy for the inkotanyi .
they did n't find him at home , because even though they had said that nobody should leave their homes , my brother went to the shop to work because it was near the house .
so my husband also went to see how things were at the shop , the people who were coming to arrest him only found me and the children at home .
so they took me first but before that they were doing bad things ; searching the house and throwing things around , hitting me with their gun @-@ butt asking me where i had hidden the gun that we had .
when they saw it they said that we use it to look at the inkotanyi , they had just got a reason . there were also water bottles that my children used to take water in , even though it was n't far , they used them .
they said it belonged to soldiers and they started beating me but not too much , telling me to show them everything else i had hidden and show them the inkotanyi .
when they did n't get the guns they took me in the car and said that if they get my husband they will release me and let me go , when we reached near the shop we saw him .
so i said to them , there is my husband , he is coming . they stopped and told him to enter the car and go give them the gun i had promised them but could n't give it away without his permission .
so i protested that they had just lied and they told me to get out of the car and watch over the kids saying that they will bring him back later .
they took my husband and i went back home to watch over the kids but at that moment you could see that our neighbours started looking at us like we were cockroaches and stigmatizing us .
i went home and rearranged everything they had disorganized and thrown around , wheat and sugar . they were very confused .
i called all my children and started comforting them telling them that they almost took me , dad was taken , they might come back and take me too but do not be afraid .
nobody was even reaching our home anymore ; if i came close to someone they would seem afraid that i was going to cause them trouble .
so i would wake up and go home , rubungo is far from kigali and nobody would direct me where he might be .
in december we were told that we can go ask at cicr about our people who were put in jail .
i did n't know the place so someone directed me but i got lost and went to president habyarimana 's house in kiyovu .
soldiers made me sit down and asked for my identity card and then they said that i was a cockroach but i denied it telling them i was n't a cockroach .
they asked me where i was going and i told them cicr so they said i was going to see spies , no someone called me to offer me a job , i said .
so they told me raise my hands and walk away singing there is no way here .
one of the soldiers showed me the place and i walked away saying what they had asked me to say , when i reached there i asked and they told me they were going to check in the computer , i did n't even know what a computer was .
my husband was taken , now i am being told that he is not on the lists . so she told me to go home and come back in three days .
after three days i came back , she had asked me to give her the names of my husband . she told me that my husband was in prison .
so i started going to visit him at the 1930 prison but did n't see him until he was released six months after just like everyone else .
we were not allowed to see our loved ones ; they told us to just bring whatever we were bringing for them on the last thursday of the month , telling us that it would be delivered to them .
so whatever we would take we would give it to the guards as they were threatening and beating us , there was no certainty that our loved ones would get it .
he was released after six months and came back home , but from that point we were not sure what was going to happen next , but after a while it was peaceful and life seemed to return to normal .
in 1992 that 's when we started hearing about the killings in bugesera , bigogwe and he would say that may be it will n't reach our region , we thought they were just selecting and killing men .
when he would walk out i would keep thinking that he will n't return but we never thought that it would be as bad as it was in 1994 .
but i think the way it started depended on the region and the place where one stayed . how did you know that the genocide had started in the place where you stayed ? did you know that habyarimana 's plane was shot down ?
how did all the events unfold in your lives , i would like you to explain and tell us ?
the place where we stayed was just opposite kanombe , it was in the valley but you could see everything that happens in kanombe .
when the plane was shot down we did n't know what it was but heard a loud explosion , it was at night and we were sleeping , we did n't have electricity so that we can stay up late .
we were in bed but not really asleep , in fact we were still talking but when heard the explosion we did n't give it much thought and we went on sleeping .
at 5 am my husband turned on the radio and it was playing classical music so he said there was a coup @-@ d' etat , when we were starting to argue about it .
there was an announcement on the radio am not sure if it was from the president 's office or the military command but it said that the plane carrying the president had crashed .
we were terrified and woke up , i said to him that its over for us but instead he said no the one who wanted us dead is gone and you are saying its over for us , i replied and said that we were not going to live instead it was over .
they knew where to find everybody and who to kill , it was planned long ago , the plain just marked the beginning .
that 's when they started working but that 's not when the genocide started , because they were already well trained and had planned , so i say that 's the day when it was implemented and perfected .
that 's when the genocide was over even though that 's when it started , so the soldiers came with one of our children showing them the way .
they found him on the way , tutsi 's were being hunted and him being one they got him and he brought them . they had list with many names and ours were at the top of the list .
when i opened i saw them and they said that i must be happy and they asked for the people who shot down the president 's plane .
i said there was nobody here and told them that we can not be happy because someone else died .
did n't you hate him , they said ? can we hate someone we do n't even know or does he know us ? we heard it like everyone else .
nobody is happy that he died especially when you are the ones that shot down his plane and the cockroaches who did it are your relatives
give us money . i do n't have money , he replied . you will give it to us , they said . he told them that they had found him sleeping and asked them to look for it . they did n't just let him go , they beat him and he gave them all the money he had on him .
they said to him , your wife must be keeping a lot of money ; women are the ones that keep money .
they opened the door for me and kept the children locked up , and then they told me to give them the money that my husband had told them that i was the one keeping it .
i told them that i did n't have any money as they kept asking for it . so i said to them , why do n't you take whatever you want and leave us in peace , it is clear that you came for a purpose .
so they took whatever they could manage as they were going away and said that they were only there looking for what to take but those who were going to kill us where on their way .
they went away and then around 9h we saw the wives of all the tutsis on one of the hills coming towards our house .
we had a big compound , so i asked them why they were coming at our home when it was the first place where they look , we are the ones they arrested first as spies , why did you come here ?
we were the first ones to be arrested . no , may be we 'll die together or something like that but we are not living this place .
my two brothers and my two older sons also stayed home and i went with the four remaining children with the girl that we had adopted and the other women that we were together .
when we reached a bit farther some people started blocking our way stopping us from moving forward but we did n't know that they were interahamwe fleeing inkotanyi from remera .
but we did n't know what was happening and started separating some going through the banana plantations , others going on along the way . we left home during the day but almost reaching our destination , a place called ndera it was n't possible because we met someone who told us that there was a road block just ahead .
the others continued to a place called jurwe , me and my children we went and hid in a place where there was cassava when we saw a police car , we stayed there until it was dark in the evening .
we went on but decided not to go to ndera but instead went to a place called musave , it was dark and we could n't see but reaching there found that that 's where everyone took refuge , there was a school .
so i asked the people i was with to force the door open of one of the classrooms since all the other classrooms seemed full .
i did n't know that i was telling interahamwe , i thought i was telling my people . they forced the door open and we spent the night there with the workers .
with other children that were our neighbours , in the morning around 8 am i saw that the others were cooking but i had n't taken anything except for sugar that i had remembered , i went to borrow a saucepan .
i had very bad memories because i got lost in the forest when my family was fleeing in 1963 .
i was found by some people , so i felt that if i let go of my child they would also get lost . so i pulled them and when we reached a little bit further we saw a car and inside was a guy form our region but he was an interahamwe .
he was a driver of the commune and was coming to take his family which had also spent the night in the same place with us .
i recognized him and i asked him if he could also take me with my children , he spit in my face and asked me where i was going since it was over for us . he packed his family in the car and left .
so i kept pulling my children behind me as we walked towards ndera , when we were almost there at a place called musave .
we saw a car with the head of region of rubungo and another man that was also from our region who was also coming to see his family which had spent the night in the same place with us .
i told him that his children had left ; they were told that their mother was alive . so , he put us in the car and took us to ndera at the catholic parish .
he said , your husband and sons are at the catholic parish let me take you there . we went but before reaching the parish we reached a place called mugahoromani and there was a roadblock .
he is called rugengamanzi , he was the head priest . he welcomed us ; he had even given them food to cook . so they welcomed us and gave us food and we were comforted that we had got refuge .
but personally i did n't want to stay at the parish because there was a man that we were not at good terms with since my husband was imprisoned among the spies .
a priest called gakuba always looked for me telling people that i was a spy , that we were cockroaches , always looking for a reason that i would stop me from coming to church or cause other people to harm me .
so i told my husband that the place had no fence and people were walking in and out at ease and also told him that if gakuba sees us he will kill us .
so i told him that instead we go to the seminary , it was the 8th . so we made sure nobody saw us and then went to the seminary which was not very far away .
with all my children and brothers we went to the seminary where we spent the night . there was a hall and we spent the night praying because things were not well .
the interim government was put in place , that 's when we found out that we were mixed with interahamwe because they started celebrating , all of a sudden we did n't talk the same language .
we spent the night in a lot of fear , in the morning of the 9th , i do n't remember well if the interim government was put in place on the 8th or 9th but it 's around that time . so on the morning of the 9th .
there is still a war going on out there , let them stay here they are ok when its all over they will go back home . so you do n't want to let them go ? let them go and we will give them soldiers to protect them , mbonapeka said .
those people who are going to protect them can not protect every single one of them , let them protect them from here .
mbonampeka went away and after a short while he came back with soldiers and shot the priests .
they were hutu priests ; one was bisop nsegiyumva 's nephew , he was called naniya rugasira and the other was ananiya , he died on the spot .
one who is called andre now lives at st. michael 's , they died on the spot . so they said whoever is hutu walk out with your identity card .
so people started walking out showing their identity cards and the ones who did n't show it , it was still visible .
young tutsi men who tried to hide in the crowd were shot from the gate . we did n't know what to do , two of my older boys so the other people going out and came to see us where we were seated .
they waved goodbye at us and said that we weill meet in heaven , they jumped the fence and ran away with one of my brothers .
there were very many and said , you took all of habyarimana 's money when your inkotanyi and cockroaches , give us our father 's money .
and whoever we find with even a coin will be killed , me and my husband did n't have anything except wearing a lot of clothes , we did n't have any money on us .
so whoever had money gave it away , but they did n't really want money they were just toying with us . after that they tried to throw a grenade where we were .
and then a lady who was wearing clothes with pearls came in with another man who had a bow with arrows , they had a list with some names .
on the list was a man called pastor , rukanika , nkundabarashe and my husband , but they did n't call out my husband a lot , they called out for pastor and rukanika .
there was also another young man called mutsinzi that they were looking for , they put a bead cover on him which made him look like a woman .
he tried to run away but they shot him , and then they saw my husband and said , here is the head of all the cockroaches , stand up , they said .
they also told my two daughters to stand up and took them outside but they did n't see me because i was behind some other women .
the woman removed their clothes and wore them , they were wearing trousers . she said to them , go back you will die at the same time with everyone else no one is going to waste anytime .
they brought them back inside the house and then the lady saw me and said , we took the child and forgot the mother remove all your clothes . they watched as i removed all my clothes .
i removed all my clothes and gave them to her as they walked away and only remained with a small dress i had on . after around 10 mins that 's when they came back and shot a woman called makurata , the wife of pastor .
they shot her legs and asked her to stand up when they had shot her legs ; they dragged her as they took us all out .
they were so many i think each one of us had two people to kill him , they took us in a field that was there and asked us to lie down .
if you did n't lie down they would hack you with a machete , it was all the same whether you lied down or stood , we lied down . my last memory is that i lied down holding hands with my daughter .
and i put the others on my side , i did n't want to part with them , they told us to lie down with our stomachs on the ground , they knew how they wanted it done .
my last memory was lying on the ground i regained consciousness only to see that i was hacked , i think it was on the 11th , at around 6pm is when it started raining and i felt like i was waking up .
so they walked around and then at night i tried to lift myself up but it was very hard , i think my brain was out where they had hacked and cut me .
it 's just that god kept me otherwise they had hacked me just like everyone else .
so i thought to myself that the others will also wake up since i had also woken up after being hacked .
i sat there among all those corpses and then all of a sudden the interahamwe came back .
i went to drink water and then as one of the interahamwe was about the hack me with a machete another asked him , you have hacked this woman so many times are n't you satisfied ?
she is n't really alive and even if she lives let her die of sorrow , leave her alone .
they went away and then i saw a priest standing in front of a praying room that 's where they had put ananiya 's corpse .
i went towards him , i knew him but he did n't recognize me because of the way i had become , i asked him to hide me inside since the interahamwe were coming back and they were going to kill me badly .
i went there , i do n't know if he is the one that covered me with those plants or god but all i know is that they came back looking for me to finish me off and they could n't find me .
they walked away saying , where is the woman that was here , where did she go since the priest did n't let her in ?
they looked for me and then said , even if she is still alive she is not coming back tomorrow . i spent the night there and then in the morning around 5am .
i went back and looked at the corpses , looking at my children and i could see their brains , i looked at my husband .
i could n't see where they had hacked him but he died holding another man 's hand , they died holding each others hands .
so i sat among the corpses and then after a while i asked myself what i was doing .
so i asked myself what i was doing among the corpses and then i walked around and then decided to go in the toilet .
let me hide in the toilet , i was thinking to myself that if they return except killing me they were also going to do other bad things , i was really afraid they were going to rape me .
they kept coming to use the toilets but they did n't enter in the one i was in .
after around three days they were still going through the bodies checking if there were no survivors .
after three days is when mbonampeka brought fuel , piled up all the corpses and then burnt them , i heard them saying it from the toilet .
they piled and burnt them and then dug a hole in front of the praying room and threw them in and then covered it and left .
but i kept saying to myself that may be one my children was alive just like i was , because the way they had made me i was n't meant to be alive .
and then i would say that may be my boys who ran away at least there is one who survived , i hid myself because i thought there was a survivor .
so i stayed in that toilet two three days without drinking anything , i had lost so much blood till there was no more to bleed .
on the fifth day is when a student from that seminary came , they had hacked people and corpses fell on him but they did n't really hack him but he was wounded a little bit .
he peeped through and saw me ; he is the one who gave me water to drink . he would give me tiny little droplets on my tongue .
he would say to me that if i drink a lot , the water would kill me . we stayed in that toilet and were joined by other children .
more people kept coming slowly ; by the time we left we were around five people . we stayed there until may 1st , that 's when they helped us from there ; we were also joined by another young boy @/ girl who also studied in the seminary .
i do n't know where he got a knife or a razor blade , he is the one that shaved me , my hair was stuck in my wounds and he could n't remove it .
the inkotanyi doctors are the ones that treated my wounds ; they started treating me from ndera . my wounds were rotten and i did n't think that they would heal or even if they healed that i would be normal again .
but they treated me and then they took me to byumba , that 's where i was treated from . so all my six children , my husband , my brothers and my sister @-@ in @-@ law .
they are all dead , but i did n't know that they were all dead . i thought that my two sons were alive , i kept saying to myself that they ran away , they are not dead .
i kept thinking that maybe they are alive , there is even someone who told me that my daughter was alive .
so one of my cousin @-@ brother from my mother 's side is the one that moved me from there and started helping me .
but when we were coming from ndera i saw they way my children had died and said .
maybe someone took my children adopting and helping them , even me let me help some .
i had been traumatized i did n't want any child to suffer so i reached byumba when i had around five children when my cousin @-@ brother was coming to take me .
i took some of them in an orphanage ; i gave the other one to a soldier who turned him into a kadogo @/ child soldier .
after the war i came back home but they were just ruins , they had destroyed everything , one of my nephews .
he is the one that got a a house for us , i went in with some of his siblings .
i became their mother but they got a relative who took them abroad .
that 's how i got orphans and took care of them and when they would find their family they would go and stay with them and if not they stay with me .
you told me that the people that came to kill you were in ndera ?
hummmm , at the seminary .
looking at where you lived its evident that it 's a long distance from where they killed you from . were those interahamwe from the region where you lived or from somewhere else ?
the interahamwe would take turns , those from ndera would go to kanombe , and those from kanombe would go to ndera . the interahamwe that killed form the seminary must have been from kanombe .
even those from kanombe were with soldiers , also those from our region , because my eldest sons fled and went back on our hill where we lived .
with my one brother that 's where they died from but i did n't know about it .
i kept looking for them , in 1997 is when we went to bury the remains that had been scattered on our hill .
they would tell me that they are in this particular place , wherever they would show me bones i would not look for signs and i would think to myself finally i have got them .
recently in april 2005 is when we buried .
someone convinced me that he knew where they were buried saying he was the one who had buried them , lets go i show them to you . i excavated twenty three people and buried them at gisozi .
they are very big graves with crosses written on their names but i realized that he was lying to me .
i do n't know if he knew what he was doing or not but i was really shocked .
n gacaca si where child who knew my children , he @/@ she was there age mate , he @/@ she is the one that clarified and said that they were thrown in a latrine .
that 's when they were excavated in october and we buried them in december and i saw signs that it was really them , like identity cards .
school cards and their clothes but they were just bones because they had decomposed .
that day we excavated two hundred and fifty people , before that people kept lying to us and we would excavate the wrong people .
we buried a lot of times burying people who we were not related to but we were burying rwandans .
we do n't regret it but they toyed with us , always excavating and burying .
burying the wrong people .
let 's talk again about burying a lot of times burying the wrong people , the people who were directing you on where to excavate were they your neighbours ?
looking closely , how would someone say that somebody died from a certain place even when they are lying to you ?
the people who were telling you where to excavate where your neighbours ?
yes they were our neighbours ; the one who even told me that he had buried my children himself was even a genocide survivor .
i said that these were the consequences of the genocide on me , it was the second time , before i use to tell him that
i am going to remember , i did n't do anything without telling him as a fellow survivor , telling him that today i am going to pray and remember and he would come .
i even asked him why he had taken so long without telling me where my children were buried and he said that he did n't want me to get traumatized .
and i told thim that i could n't get traumatized it was all the same since every 11th of april i would have prayers to remember them .
why did n't you let me get traumatized once and for all but atleast bury them , so in gacaca that child said where they were buried .
i called him and even thought that the child is the one who was lying to me , we almost started arguing but i realized i would be disrespecting myself and did n't want any confrontation with him .
i ignored him and said that i was just feeling the consequences of the genocide so i decided to fight them they way i normally fight but the other thing is that in 1995 .
those who misled us in excavating all those bodies on the different hills are the ones who participated in killing the not only my people but all the people on that hill .
but gacaca is exposing them all , they are turning on each other , those who are in jail denounce those who were not put in jail and those who are in jail also denounce those who are being released .
that 's how things are in our region .
lets talk again about the other children who were killed from ndera and were later burnt , we can tell that ...
where they buried them , i do n't if it 's because i was still very traumatized in 1997 is when we first said prayers for them .
i am the one who showed where they were thrown there is a bush even pictures of the place .
and the way i watered the place but when they said to excavate the bodies i said no , i do n't want you to excavate them ; they were n't many other people that survived from there .
it was me and the one boy who is now in switzerland , he is a member of ibuka there , his name is cesar . we asked them not to excavate them since they had also burnt them .
we asked if they could make the place look good and the priests promised us they were going to build a beautiful memorial , its there and every 11th of april we go there to commemorate .
they were in hundreds around four hundred because all the classrooms were full , there was even a hall that was full , the hutus later went out but they were few .
the majority were the tutsis seeking refuge .
so you mean that in the four hundred seeking refuge the survivors are not more than ten ?
at the seminary it 's just me and cezar , they are some kids who also ran away , but the ones we are sure of and count are me and cezar .
we are the only ones who came out of the corpses .
if we talk about your children that died in masoro did you get to know who killed them or how they were killed except the fact that they were thrown in the pit latrine ?
in gacaca they talk about the people who died but even the ones who are there played a major role in it but what is clear is that whoever is involved were arrested because of gacaca .
they normally first hacked people before throwing them in the pits , did you get to know if your children were thrown in the pit alive or after being hacked .
we 've been very good friends and we are going to die ; where we are going they do n't wear shoes , take my shoes and remember me whenever you look at them .
and please tell the story .
and then they told those who were about to kill them to wait so that they can first pray , and when they had finished praying they threw them in the pit .
he is the one who told us all that .
but personally i think that if that boy was given shoes by your son it means that he even saw the ones who killed them .
he knows them but he says that he ran away , they do n't agree to say everything clearly .
they do n't want to state facts i think of fear that the remaining ones will hurt them . he says that he ran away and says the one who chased him away and hit him with a stick on the shoulders .
so he says that he does n't know who killed them but others say that he was killed by a man called habari , he is dead .
he has n't even come back to court because he was imprisoned when he was still young but may be he will . gacaca will deal with it , i personally do n't know .
i understand that your whole family died but no one forgets her family , can you please tell us about your husband , what kind of man was he ?
how did he relate with other people and what is the one thing that you remember about him that you can not forget ?
there is no way i can forget him , i do n't know how i can describe him i think that picture describes a lot , he was a very calm man .
he was avery humble man who easily related with everyone but especially he loved children , i think that 's why he went with our children .
he was very easy to relate to and was very merciful ; he could easily ignore himselfo or others .
that was his nature , he was a man that really loved his family , i think if he had been greedy when he was released from jail he would have abandoned us .
but he did n't , he loved everyone , he did n't hate anyone , he loved the poor and humble .
my children were also like that , they loved other kids and were always warm and happy , i can n't forget them , instead i try to imitate them and fail .
i do n't know how to say it , but here they killed all your family and finished it , if they came and confessed their fault , would you forgive them ?
to forgive , they are words that people are quick to use but it does n't even make sense . the person who asks it and you who says that you have forgiven him it 's not something easy .
because personally the way i see this country it belongs to all rwandans , its not just mine it 's not even for only the genocide survivor , it 's impossible .
evil is not repaid by evil ; personally i told god that i can n't do anything on my own .
i can n't manage anything on my own , i do n't think i would even be alive , i think i would have gone mad . i surrender everything to god because to be able to get out of all the corpses of my children .
my husband , relatives and neighbours that were lying there dead , i did n't think i was going to live .
i told god that he is the one in control and knows why everything happened . i asked god for something and he gave it to me , i told god that those who died and those who are alive , i asked that he may give me the power to love without focusing on anything else .
so instead of being burdened i asked god to give me a big heart so that i can offer mercy to everyone who needs it .
even if it 's a hutu who killed my family and he comes when he is broken down .
in need of mercy and forgiveness , i would forgive him because he is a human being , i can n't do the same atrocities like he did . it 's really not by my strength that i can do this , i will n't lie to you .
because on my own i am nothing and i would be nothing but the fact that god saw that my children and body were dead .
i was disgusting and he revived me and people want to be with me when before they use to run away from me , people who saw me immediately after the genocide would avoid me .
i was hideous and disgusting and there 's no one who really took care of me to say they did it .
except my cousin @-@ brother but even for him it would n't have been possible without god 's power .
i would have gone mad , but god kept and made me who i am today , so even me in his love i must do what he asks me to do and whoever asks me for forgiveness in truth , i would forgive them .
and when someone is saying something from the depth of their heart you can tell and i can forgive them , but they do n't ask for forgiveness because someone asks for forgiveness is someone with a human heart .
someone with humanity in them comes close to you because he sees that you are human , whe he does n't it 's because he thinks that you are still the thing that he called you before .
they dehumanized us by calling us cockroaches and other horrible names so i think they still see that in us , so whoever comes close to me , i would forgive them .
after hearing the difficult things that you went through , surviving among all those people and your family being dead .
nowadays how can i describe murebwayire josephine , what kind of person is she even though her whole family died , is she someone with hope even though her whole family died in the genocide ?
please tell us , how do you feel deep inside because i do n't understand ?
it does n't make sense humanly speaking , it 's beyond our human nature and when they say beyond our human nature , it means it 's not human .
everything that happened in my life since i was a child up to now is beyond human nature but there is someone who created human nature .
i did n't think i would have those responsibilities , it means that i had died and resurrected . in resurrecting i resurrected a new being not the same person .
so i have to accept the way i always tell people that josephine died and aunty lived .
because now i am called aunty of all the children , any child who comes to me with a problem that i can fix , i fix it .
to confort and convince that that child must live and encourage him @/@ her , so i think i was left behind so that i may be an aunty to all the children .
a child who comes to me with a problem that i can fix , i fix it and confort them and convince him that they must live .
i encourage and strengthen them , i feel like i was left behind so that i can be a mother to all children without mothers .
it 's not a must that i take care of them in my house but they are some i advise on certain issues and they move forward .
they are some that i have here in my house . i have six children , two girls and four boys .
the other thing is that god who kept me has a plan for my life that he helps to fulfill it , he did n't put me to shame , i would have gone crazy , and it was possible .
they hacked me in the head but i did n't loose my mind i can think , it means i must live my life thanking god and doing what i can .
it 's something that can help others .
how do you relate to the neighbours that you had befor all this , how is your relationship ?
after the genocide which affected your life and the life of many rwandans , do you think that there can be normal trustworthy relationships ?
between the killers and victims ?
about trust i do n't know if its kadafi who said that , protect me form my friends because i already know my enemies .
god gave us the wisdom to think , when you live with someone there is no reason to disturb someone who is going through hard times , if i am able i can help him @/@ her as a rwandan and if they are celebrating i can celebrate with him @/@ her .
but i live well with my neighbours i do n't how to segregate people saying one is hutu so i will n't greet them , or insulting someone that they are interahamwe .
when i see someone i see a human being and i only see evil when that person commits it , but i do n't push anybody away .
my heart welcomes everyone who comes to me with good intentions , if you do n't then i do n't give you my time .
in the genocide especially women went through a lot of difficulties , besides killing them and finishing off their children , many were raped and infected with diseases .
besides being raped they went through a lot of fifficulties and problems that personally i think that widows have a lot of problems .
as a result of the genocide , it is very difficult because you find that someone has a sickness that will kill her at some point .
if she is not burdened by disease , the genocide ended and she is probably in a lot of poverty , i woulk like you as a woman .
who went through the same and lost your whole family which is a very difficult thing to endure , i would like you to paint a picture for us of the genocide widows who are suffering the hard consequences .
you have just asked me a very difficult question , i am part of a widows ' association called avega agahozo .
i am the second vice @-@ president on the national level , it 's an association that we set up because among widows there are many categories . there are some who were raped and infected with hiv & aids .
there are some girls who gave birth to children they did n't want , they are some who were hacked and do not have some limbs , some do n't have hands .
some do n't have eyes , they are different handicaps and then they are those who are emotionally handicaped .
and physically they do n't have a home , without a house to live in , many times they are next door to the ones who kileed their families and injured them .
you understand that its adding more sorrow to an already broken heart , so our associationts goal is to stand by them and confort them telling them not to loose heart .
telling them that the fact that they are still alive that they will continue to live , we are lucky that we got a project that helps them with anti @-@ retro viral medication for hiv & aids .
there are many who died because the medication just started coming in recently , they are many who passed away .
and it can really affect her because the medication is strong , to get food everyday is not easy because you can see that we are widows like them .
we do n't have work and those who do sometimes have other responsibilities in their home , but we try to help and confort each other .
what we mainly do is speak out because most people live in despair , so avega advises , conforts and brings us together .
that is our main objective of our association , to bring us together , confort each other , convincing someone that if they are in pain tomorrow they might be conforted , if they are sick tomorrow they can get better .
hiv & aids is bad disease in the body but its clear now that it does not even kill when one gets those medication .
so what we do is tell them the fact that they are in pain does n't mean that they die , and we speak up for them to the government , our desire is that these people are not given up on or forgotten .
these people who are sent home and forgiven really traumatizes us because it seems as though they are the ones who are cared for .
but with us it seems as though those who advocate for us do not have strength or there is no emphasis so that the problems are solved , of course nobody can bring back the people who died .
if they help us it can be over .
but it has been thirteen years after the genocide , can we say that people are still the same way they were when the genocide had just ended ?
thirteen years later , if you compare the way things are now and the way they were immediately after the genocide .
do you think that atleast people are moving from the state of turmoil and life is being restored ?
it 's just that no one can solve all the problems at once , or if we see a hundred people go on to say that everyone died but things have really changed a good example is the orphans that went to school and now have completed their studies it is evidence .
and now they are in university and some have finished , is their a child who came out of a pit thinking that he was going to study .
the widows did n't have a place to stay , can that person say that nothing was done .
it 's not enough may be because of limited means but i can n't say that they did n't help us .
generally rwandans are not doing great now imagine those who were taken out of their own .
but slowly i think something has changed but there 's still a long way to go . they problem is that there are some people who are doing very badly and it huts me when i hear that they support farg .
they say that in three months there are people who do not even it ten thousands francs , i am hurt whenever i hear this , sometimes i think thats its mocking us .
they should look for a way that a person should be supported continually so that they do n't keep going to ask for help .
i wanted to ask you something in line with rememebering our loved ones that were degraded and humiliated in the genocide .
they were thrown in different places after the genocide , someone has to go searching ... and then they are buried , so i wanted to ask you how do you think our people should be buried ?
the first and best way to honor our people is to know where they were thrown and we bury them taking them out of the holes .
to take them out of pit latrines , to be able to say that teh people in this district are going to be honored and buried and all of us get ready and go there remember and honor them . but rememeber well is to remember well is to remember the ones that remained behind . do n't go to remember a man
we teach them good manners just like their parents would have done and then go the memorial sites and remember all the people who passed away .
personally there is a way i feel that we should remember our people and bury them in such a way that we would always remember them .
but both things work together just like you have said , about the survivors . there is no way that someone can remain in that kind of trouble without knowing where to live and starving .
so that we may always rememebr them , i want that you will make your comment and say what you think .
i think that after thirteen years that the genocide has ended its not a lot of years , but when you look at the way the memorial sites are maintained .
it is evident that they are not well taken care of and nothing is done about it , clearly if nothing is changed about the way they are managed then after twenty years they will be in a visibly bad condition .
so here i want to ask , remembering is for who ? is it for the survivors , is for our neighbouring countries ?
because many times people remember in april , there is no initiative so that memorial sites are always mintined and in good condition .
you would think that we forget where they went and say , i will go visit my people in april .
but your loved one is always on your mind and heart and you always want to know where they spent the day and where they are but those memorials in the provinces and even the strong ones here .
you said twenty years but i think twenty is a lot of time because they are some that are already getting spoiled .
some places are crumbling , in other places there are bushes where animals are taken to eat grass , remebering is not for the genocide survivors only , its not even just for the government , because the government is people .
it 's for all rwandans to remember , i do n't see how some one who is neighbours with a memorial , i always take an example of kanombe .
at the main road they had put there a metallic fence but they stole them and finished them off , i do n't understand how some one steals from a memorial site , what do you do with those thinks ?
it is the home of those people , they may not be here on earth but it is there home .
i personally think that people should make it their purpose and we are also lucky that now we have lower levels of government the umudugudu @/@ village .
as we are winding up , even though the genocide took place , we can n't forget about it .
and we do n't wish for it to happen again , so i would like to ask you , according to the hard times we went through and saw we do n't want it to happen again .
what heritage would you like to give to the rwandan children who did n't go throught these things ?
what kind of rwanda would you like to give to them as a heritage compared to the one you lived in ?
i think that the new heritage has started already , there are still problems but i am really glad that no child is asked to stand up in class because of their ethnicity .
the way it 's not being done in schools it should also be the same in people 's homes because all the ad influence takes place at home behind closed dooors .
on the cooking stove that 's how they always say , we parents are the ones that offer as a heritage good or bad things to our children .
the teacher is given responsibilities and a syllabus to follow but no one controls someone 's home .
are the ones with a problem and nobody will control and know what is being taught . the genocide was slowly taught for forty years but we have just spent thirteen years teaching to live at peace .
if we continue to live in peace , our children would live together in peaceful rwanda with no turmoil and ethnicity .
but it starts with us the old and mature ones , we need to uproot it , i would like the government to emphasize refusing and condemning any word that leads to the genocide .
and whoever uses it should be punished publically even more than the one that actually used a machete , because a machete is used by someone who first talked about it . personally i would like our children without differentiating to all have a heritage of peace .
i do n't know if there 's anything you would like to add on as we are concluding our talk ?
there 's nothing except to thank you because you thought of me and came to interview me , and for these things to happen , you can also tell me if you think that the things i said make sense .
if they make sense then you can keep them and if they do n't then you remove them .
they can be somebody else 's opinion , thank you .
thank you too ; there is someone who said they call you nsababera , or nsababera eraste .
uuh !
your mother built for him a house ; did you find him after genocide ?
i said about it .
if is there anything you can say about it , go on and say it .
so freddy , maybe you can begin by telling me your name . maybe you can tell me your name and your age .
my name is mutanguha freddy and i am 28 years old .
freddy , can you tell me ... tell me your earliest memory . the first thing you can remember about your childhood ? from when you were a child , what sort of things do you remember from your childhood ?
when i was young , i remember i was very boisterous . i used to be so boisterous . i remember my mum would talk about me with other parents , telling them she had a very boisterous son who would break all utensils . i remember i used to like playing football ; i joined a senior team when i was still in primary school . nothing else could make me happy as much as playing football . that is my best memory .
tell me about your memory of your parents . if you recall ...
i will begin with my mum who gave birth to me . my mother was the person i loved the most in the whole world ; i can still remember everything she used to do . maybe because i used to be by her side all the time .
what is the memory of your household with your sisters and everybody ? what is the strongest memory you have about all the children ?
tell me about particularly happy times that you had in your family ? maybe holidays , maybe a celebration or a wedding , or a party ... i do n't know , just tell me something that you remember with a fond memory .
tell me , what did she tell you ?
tell me about a difficult memory from the genocide .
do you know who did it ? ... do you know who killed them ?
freddy , how did they kill your mother ?
my mother was beaten to death with clubs .
during the rest of the genocide , did you continue to witness what the killers were doing ? did you see the killers often ?
i normally think about it ... it normally happens during april because that is when i think about what took place in rwanda the most . yeah , in april is when i remember . and during that time , i get nightmares , i see people killing others ... i see interahamwe killing people . but otherwise , i am lucky i rarely have nightmares . however , in april i get them .
can i ask you more difficult questions ... can i ask two more ... is it okay ? how did the killers go about doing their work ? what did you see them doing to your family , to other people , what did you see ? how did it happen ?
yes , i know them very well ... i know them . one of them is called niyonsenga ; he wanted to rape my sister . however , he never succeeded . they were very many and i knew them .
freddy , what does it mean to ... be a survivor , what did you feel when you survived ?
what did you feel in 1994 ... ? how old were you ... 15 , 16 .. ? oh 19 . what did you feel ? did you feel angry , did you feel empty ? did you feel ... what was in your mind and in your heart ?
do you think that people understand your experience ? .
a few people understand . obviously not everyone can understand what i went through . some people did not even want me to live and they still do n't want me to be alive today and they 're not happy when they see me prospering . those who are with us do understand , those who went through similar things , especially those who share our lives daily .
can you forgive people that carried out these problems ?
why did you start to be involved in a.e.r.g , why did you do that ? why did you think it important to try that ?
do we learn anything from the genocide ? do we learn anything from the genocide ... ? does genocide ... does it teach us anything ?
what do you think the international comunity should learn ?
the international community needs to know that it is very important to keep one 's word and that they can not take it back . they also need to know that they did very little to save the people who were dying in our country . they also need to know that survivors are there and that these survivors need to live a good life . they need to know that the genocide actually happened and they need to show respect to its victims and to acknowledge that these victims were actually innocent .
can i ask you the same question again .... would you like to have a family one day ?
in my future plans , i plan to have a family . and i plan to teach my family the same morals i was taught .
what would you tell them ?
what they first need to know is that the word of a parent is of great value . that 's something they need to know and keep in their hearts ; especially when they are positive advice . i will keep on showing them the example of what i was told so they can one day tell it to their descendants . here i am talking about my wife and my children .
and finally , who is freddy today ? which sort of a person are you ?
this is the 29th of march 2004 , in kigali and we are speaking to rosette . rosette could you first of all give me your name and your age ?
my name is sebasoni musabe rosette , i am twenty @-@ five years old .
and after the genocide ehh ... how many of your family were killed in the genocide ?
during genocide , i lost my parents and my four sisters . in total , i lost six people in my family .
can you describe for me ... eh , describe for me your mother ?
tell me about your father .
all i can say about my father ... he was also a wonderful parent . we realized it after the genocide as people say a lot of good about them . they say , "@ it seemed impossible that such good people would spend their old age together and see their own children when the latter are adults . @" actually all i said about my mum similarly applies to my dad . although he was a quiet man , he also had so many friends .
... especially his collegues and neighbours . and most friends we have now ... the people who helped us after the genocide were my father 's friends . former schoolmates , colleagues ... usually the female parent is the one who is more familiar with the children . however , our dad too showed us love .
tell me about happy times ... a particularly happy memory that you have with your parents .
the one who was after me was called consolee , another one was called angelique . she was followed by the one called illuminee . another one was called florence . there was also an adopted child at home called jeanne . we considered her as part of our family .
sorry , could you please tell me the names of your sisters again ?
my sisters who died in the genocide , were consolee , angelique , illuminee and florence . but there was also an adopted child who died together with them and we considered her as our sister . she was called jeanne .
what was your relationship with your sisters , how did you get on with your sisters ?
if you were going to remember only one thing about your mother , what would it be ?
what i remember about my mother ... is the advice she used to give all types of people . and that was why most people liked her . she was humble and able to give people advice . i guess that is the one thing i recall .
did you see it happen ?
yes , i saw it . because we were together when they took them . and killed them in our presence .
what happened ?
do you know how your parents died ?
my parents were hit with clubs to death . after killing them , they threw their bodies outside and cursed them . later that evening my brother went and covered them with some soil with the help of someone else .
did you witness ... did you see the interahamwe carrying out their killings ?
can you describe for me anything very dificult ... can you discribe for me , the ... just one of those things you saw that stays very strongly in your mind and maybe ... no. before you do that , what was going though your mind ? was it fear , was it survival , what happened during that time ... what were you thinking ... what were you feeling ?
can you discribe for me just ... just something you saw during that time , which really stayed in your mind as the most terrible , the most difficult moment ?
rosette , what does it mean for you , being a survivor ?
and after the genocide , how did you survive ? who looked after you ... where did you go ... ? what did you do ?
how many of your simblings survived ? who survived among your brothers and sisters ?
in my immediate family , we were six and only two survived ; my older brother and i.
what do you think about the future ... what kind of future do you see ?
rosette , is it possible to forgive the people who committed these crimes ?
do you think that you have had justice for your parents and your sisters ? has justice been done to your parents ?
my very last question . do you think that genocide is possible here again ?
i hope genocide will never happen again in rwanda . i guess the ideology that rwanda has now , together with the lessons people learnt from killing one another , really people ... i do n't think it will ever happen again . i believe we experienced it , we unfortunately experienced it . i think we have a task of teaching people how to respect each other . i mean , if everyone respects human rights , then there would be no genocide again . and even now i believe there will be no genocide again .
i said that was my last question but i have one more question . what kind of person are you after this ? are you hopeful , are you optimistic ... are you sad and unhapppy ? who is rosette ?
my name is mukundwa safi , i am 21 years old , and before the genocide we lived in kibuye , in the former commune of gitesi , currently known as karongi community , in the bwishyura sector , the sector kept its old name , bwishyura cellule .
how many members did your family have before the genocide ?
i was in kibuye when the genocide started , i was eight years old .
could you give as an account of your experiences during the genocide and how you managed to survive ; could you in a few words recount how you lived through the genocide from its beginning and how it was carried out in your area of kibuye ?
the eighteenth of april , it was about two o'clock in the afternoon when three buses arrived with people singing and hanging on them , they were singing genocide songs ; the genocide songs that they sang at that time , those songs that you all know , they got off the buses and kept singing , for those who know the kibuye sports stadium , gatwaro is in a low laying area with hills on either sides , we were in the middle , then they started to shoot into the crowd .
one of my first terrible images of the genocide is one that always comes back to me , there was this man , who claimed to have become a hutu following some rwandan customs , he moved up towards the interahamwe on the gatwaro hill , when he got close enough one of them picked an axe and hit him splitting him open like firewood , they cut his body into two pieces and threw him back into the stadium .
the interahamwe at that point had not given us any orders , then suddenly they came , i think they had been in a meeting , they ordered us to dig pits , go did pits they said , children will bury children , you should bury your relatives , the rest will be buried on top to cover the pits and we all thought that is how it was going to be .
i kept on realizing where i was , at that time i was wearing a dress , it had been torn to pieces by the machetes and was full of blood , i then thought about checking other parts of the body , and they were also full of blood , the whole body as it was , with mud from the valley , water and other things ; that was at the sunset , early in the morning i wanted to ; when i regained consciousness i wanted to know truly if my family had died .
we always waited for the dates when we were supposed to be killed but the interahamwe would come and say , we will kill you the day after tomorrow , then one day they came and ordered us out to be killed , i was so weak and i was unable to move , esther was also very weak and so we were unable to walk to our place of slaughter so they promised to come and kill us later
recently , in the year two thousand ; the year two thousand and two , she died ; she was n't ill , it was a sudden death , she left work , went to bed and died , that pushed me back a lot , to be honest about life ; about the experiences i lived through the genocide . i do n't know how to rank those experiences that remind me of the genocide , they are just so many . i will never forget
you told us about your mother , you also talked about your brother , you did n't tell us about your father or any other siblings
they went north towards bisesero , we did n't meet from that point
so you never managed to know how they died or the way they were killed ?
in the beginning it was very difficult , i felt a lot of pain ; even when i had other kinds of problems , they always brought up the memories of my mother 's suffering and i wished she was still alive . it is understandable to hurt when your parent suffers and her life is taken . the pain you feel is understandable
you were quite young during the genocide , eight years old , is there anything you remember about life before the war , you and your family at home ; the genocide later came and claimed the lives of your family members and parents , can you tell us the fondest memories of your mother ?
i can not stop studying until i have attained at least ; at least a degree , she had high hopes in me , she hoped i would grow up to become someone ; a rwanda girl who is the pride of her mother , as her single girl child , and about the genocide we were able to share her last suffering and when i think of that , it gives me strength to keep fighting to live again .
can you recognize any of the people who were involved in the murder of your mother and brother ?
as i had already said , it was sunset and i was n't able to see clearly and it was out of our neighborhood ; there is one person i know though ; i remember him , he even told me that i should pay him back if i can , it was the guard named francois sinzabakira
the other people left , he took me on his back and we fled , we hid in the swamps of cnd , known as cnd . the interahamwe attacked and found us inside , we started to run and there came a time we ran separate ways and i could not find my brother again , other people picked me up because i was terribly wounded in the head that i had shrapnel inside the wounds . they used some small sticks to remove those shrapnel inside my head so that i can get healed .
undefined
do you have a house ?
i do n't have a house , i rent ; i live in a rented house . i stay in there and when i manage to get the rent which is five thousand rwandan francs i pay it . sometime they even want to throw me out of the house but god helps me , or i meet a good person and he @/ she gives me two thousand rwandan francs so i pay it that way coz that is the only money with me . i finally finish my day and night like that .
what would you ask for , the people who are able to help you .
i would ask the people who are able to help me to live , house renting and send me back to school .
what is the image , or thing that will cause you not to forget genocide in your entire life or your memories ?
today is 23rd of march 2007 . we are at kacyiru together with father muzungu bernardini where we are going to have a conversation on history . father bernardini muzungu can you start by introducing yourself .
like you already said , i am called bernardin muzungu and i am a dominican father i live here in kacyiru . i was born back home on a hill called buhoro in nyaruguru , i was born in 1932 .
i got here amongst the dominican fathers through the lengthy journey of schooling starting from kibeho , in the elementary school in kabgayi , being part of the dominicans made me go to countries abroad , france , sweden , england , canada .
you have begun well , that is a very important question having the first point to what i am going to say , the history of the world and that of rwanda like i will talk about here , is got from things i read but in brief because often when we are asked you find someone just merely speak
i want to tell those who will be able to hear me that what i am talking about comes from three chapters of the history of rwanda . i will start from the first chapter , and what happened before that . the history of rwanda we know , in french it is math , archaeology and fossils that scholars found on earth that told them the history before man could write , i think that you all heard about it .
the first human on earth in the bible is called adam and also eva , they say that they were in africa , which is very close to here , our home , i will start from here . these therefore are the things we find in those fossils .
and the other chapter in which we find history especially us rwandans is the one which our forefathers told us , i think we all know that we find stories and many other things , names of hills but usually the source of these stories or way through which we get these ideas of rwandans and their true history which is with evidence are three
the first are poems , i think you have all heard that poems exist and that they existed starting with queen nyirarumaga in the 16th century . then there is the second one , royal secrets , royal secrets also are things which started long ago with gihanga .
the royal secret keeper of the ancient basinga clan who was called rubunga who was the one who brought royal secrets to the banyiginya clan and told them to gihanga , which resulted in that ritual of continuing to teach the royal secret keepers during the reign of the banyiginya clan .
what existed before kingdoms in this country ? coming back to the scholars who base their research on fossil findings say our country , our region and africa is where they all claim without doubt that the first human being was discovered here .
this made them explore this place because of the fossils which revealed how the first human beings were . there reached a time when explorers came to rwanda and burundi .
and you often hear that ancient human beings including the king used to hunt . there was also if you analyse the period when the forest reduced is when cattle came , like they say , when cattle graze . the thick forest is destroyed and then demolished .
then the hoe followed , if you observe , i will come back to it , is when they begun to come up with names we are used to now like hutu , tutsi and twa you see that those they called the twa were hunters .
those who bred and herded cattle were called the tutsi , those who were cultivators were called the hutu but you realize they were one people . we shall later come to see how the error of calling it tribes came to be .
those are the people we know of and what existed before the time of kings , in brief that is what one can say and i think that is enough so that we continue our journey of the questions you are going to ask me
let me quickly ask a question , you have told us that those who were hunters were called the batwa while others were called the hutu and others were called the tutsi . what made them for example the people who bred became called the tutsi , what was considered so as to call the tribe that bred cattle the tutsi ?
i will come to that , we shall talk about it . there is a man called speak who brought that theory of tribes , if you are patient we shall get to it in a little while , but rather the question is how the cultivators or the breeders or the hunters came to be called tribes , if you can be patient , i will explain it to you .
i said that they were just natives , and it is archaeology because no one saw them . it is archaeology giving an example as to why they say what they say like what we see here if we can maybe say like archaeologists who found blacksmiths . here in this book , there are photos of hummers and small rocks , i think if it were visible one could see that there are small ropes here and pots .
when they say that the first human being was from africa , close to here , the assumption that they came from somewhere else is a misunderstanding , they did not come from anywhere , instead they came from here to other places and those who migrated were coming from here .
to say therefore that the hutu , tutsi and twa are tribes , i will explain it to you in a while and where it came from , now let us only say that where archaeologists found cow dung were cattle keepers , the hoe was also discovered . they were found in the ground and they found them not to be present day hoes but those of long ago , so there was also cultivation , there were cows , they also found jaws of cows .
in reference to those people you have told us who were cultivators while others were live stock keepers and others who were potters , what were their cultural similarities so as to know how the inhabitants of rwanda were related at that time .
i beg your pardon ?
during the reign of gihanga , the kingdom if rwanda had been established , what can you tell us about the way of life of the rwandan society ?
we shall add the second one later . let us start with the way of life in rwanda then the leadership of the settlement .
the father has just finished telling us about the way of life in this region we are living in , the time before history .
poems truly are the first source , in the royal secrets , the royal secret keepers especially speak of how the leadership of the country is , i will come back to it in a little while of course , there were also riddles and family lineages of the kings and how they succeeded each other like the queens and the tribes of rwanda which were called also went succeeding each other on the throne
it started therefore like we said a while ago that here in rwanda , they found a long time ago , before jesus , hunters , livestock keepers and cultivators . after some time they came together and became many , then they ruled so as to live together , if one is to explain it properly , one can start from how the society of rwanda started , i will also add on how it came to give birth to a kingdom .
that is ok . a family as we know it is a man or a boy and a girl who come together and give birth to children . while the rwandan family is still small , be it three people that is man , woman and children before they are married is called a home , that you know . after the homes have become many to the level of grandparents , they are called households after the households had become many and populated , one would go and live over there on the hill .
you all know that the children , on the hill , would settle next to him as he went on taking over . hills while he still had strength .
and get his own portion of land . when the houses become many , they were then called clans , those clans would have an area in which they lived and also ruled , protecting their land and property , later it came to be called a kingdom , that is how kingdoms came about .
later on after the kingdoms had become numerous with clans , i think you know about kingdoms made up of clans we hear about them , we find them especially in this book by father kagame , it is the one i wanted to show you called inganji karinga , it is where he showed us where the banyiginya clan begun their reign with gihanga , it is in this book that we are told the kingdoms which were in our region , which was later called rwanda .
the kingdoms that existed around the time of gihanga , in the baziga clan which we now call bubari is in the nation park , also in ndowra was the reign of the bashambo , you realize that it is the kingdom of the bashambo it was over there in kibungo , gisaka , of the bagesera , here in nduga , there were the babanda and here where we are seated also were others and in many other places .
gihanga begun his rule by trying to bring together all those small kingdoms made up of clans , he started by working together with others but you realize they begun from a home to household to clans , a clan does not mean what we term it as that is to say hutu and tutsi , tribe meant what is called clans , those were tribes . this has led me to show you another book which talks about it clearly .
that is how it was . a family had a head , a parent those heads of every family , family in this case means household , in the clan they were ruled by their leader who headed the whole family and was called the king , the king is to say the popular one in ancient kinyarwanda , to be famous is like being popular . later the king of the banyiginya who was called mukobanya , kigeli mukobanya the 1st .
he gained the wisdom of never again sharing with children , before they used to go together and they would be let 's say like the basinga or especially like in gisaka . in gisaka is where it took long to be part of rwanda because it became part of rwanda during the reign of rwabugiri the 3rd . mukobanya is the one who started conquering countries and colonizing them by putting his own rulers , he went bringing things together , that is what gave birth to rwanda .
before they were just small kingdoms , rwanda was only made up of the banyiginya but it was not a kingdom when it had just annexed others , rwanda existed but together with others relatives , and came together with others . mukobanya is the one who worked together with others to get things for himself .
that is where the word to escape from rwanda originated from and he then established the rwanda of gasabo . when you see the way i put together a society and kingdom ... it begun as a society , society came from home and as it grew to become a large kingdom , it became many small kingdoms , the banyiginya came and brought together those small kingdoms after winning them in battle and made them a united kingdom .
mukobana is the one who brought that ideology of one nation , he established a government of course , i can not go through the whole government except that there was a king who ruled together with those he shared with the leadership . there were the commanders of the army guarded the whole country .
but concerning the country 's wealth , there were heads of wealth , that is to say those who looked after the resources , there were also cultivators who headed all cultivators who was known as the head of the land . there were three branches of government , they did not put a government for hunters , often they all were hunters especially in the royals who hunted more than others , potters also moulded of course but that did not mean that they were leaders .
and those who were potters . that was the government . i will talk about how it later came to be removed , later when white men came , they removed that government which was of three branches and made it one , they became chiefs , assistant chiefs and others but that is something else . that is what i can say on how the government of that time was there was something similar to democracy because the king , after they had one government when the banyiginya clan had conquered , that is nganji karinga .
after the banyiginyahad conqured other kingdoms , of all those kings that existed , after inganji karinga had conqured others , they looked for a way of woking together with societies which were strong , there were societies called ibibanda , ibibanda are the ones who give birth to the royal family . in the ancient royal family to be honest , the king came from the banyiginya clan but had queens who resembled , the queen with whom he shared the throne had a clan from which she came from .
that is what came to give birth to the words that clans are not calms because nobody was only a cultivator , nobody was only a livestock breeder , no society was only made up of livestock breeders and another made up of cultivators only , that is a lie , we were related and one would become a cultivator and another a livestock breeder . in a few words i think i can stop there and maybe you can ask me anything on that .
you have just finished telling us about the way of life in the rwandan society and you went on to tell us a bit about the governance . i want us to therefore go deeper into the way of governance of the country . you told as that governance result from people coming together coming from families to the households which came together .
and they became clans .
and they became clans , you told us that the banyiginya clan was the clan from which rwanda came from but there were other clans in this region , and many other kingdoms here . i want you to tell us how that kingdom of the banyiginya , that kingdom of the banyiginya , how it went in building rwanda . did it go capturing other kingdoms , how did they capture them ? those who were captured , how were they captured ? what would those that were captured give to be part of rwanda ?
but we will not make it long , it is in brief . speaking in a few words , if i talk about how they went about with it , often they went to war , you know that long ago in rwanda , there was something called an army , they were called an army and they came times of war
all rwandans were part of the , army when they heard that rwanda had existed for long , the first weakness is that it all depended on the army . the army had heads of government . every rwandan belonged to a certain group of the army , therefore had many responsibilities but the most important was to fight for the country but there were many other things like dance , like doing all other duties , but they included fighting for the country .
be it to stand for it or save it when it has been attacked . if you take a close look what the banyiginya were better at than others was the wisdom of knowing how to safe guard the country and how to fight . they went therefore capturing small kingdoms while adding them to others and maybe they had better leadership like sharing and interacting , so how did they rule so as to govern them ? first of all is that they would go and remove them from leadership but share with them .
the next question is on the history during the colonial time but before we go to the colonial time , there is a question i wanted to ask which i feel lays ground for the next question of the colonialists . history tells us that rwanda probably begun
from rwagasabo which was one hill . the hill of gasabo , is there something you can tell us about it . the white man found extending to rwicanzizu , rwanda had grown big and extended to masisi , it was very large . i therefore want that maybe we first answer the question of rwanda 's history , there reached a time of colonialists in 1897 . can you tell us how rwanda was changing and developing , as new people came , how far had rwanda reached ?
thank you , continuing with our conversation with father muzungu , we have finished talking about . i can not say that we have finished because were are following our program , we seemed to be talking about rwanda in the time of colonialists . can you tell us about rwanda in colonization in the time white men reached rwanda .
that 's a good question , it 's in line with what we were saying , in the same way i will divide it into two parts , that concerning how locals of rwanda were colonised and how the colonialists took over power in rwanda , i think that 's better . let me start with the locals of rwanda , how were they colonized ? that 's where our problems started because the white man came with foreign ideology
there was a british man called captain john honing speak who came to our africa around this area in ethiopia and even reached uganda , then saw people of the hima tribe , babito tribe and then reached here and saw the rwandans especially the tutsi who of course looked like the hima who were cattle keepers . after seeing this he thought that the tutsi were not rwandans but from up there in ethiopia , from the bagara , that they looked like the bagara who were the cattle keepers and drunk milk
milk has an effect on one who takes it . he brought about the mentality that rwandase were not the same , that some that is the tusti came from up there and that the hutu are like the other africans from around , he brought about that mentality they are not from around this area , he gave us that mentality , we all thought were from around here without discriminating that this is an african or a kenyan or tanzanian or abisinya
he brought that . other priests and white men with whom he was believed him and when he went back to his home he wrote a book talking about that trip he took to africa and in the 9th chapter of that book talked about rwanda in other words his discoveries here in africa called aux sources du nil in french , a book was written in france called aux sources du nil
here i have a book by a white man called alexander arnold , a white priest , he wrote this book called les peres blancs aux sources du nil ; he is one of the people who took on speak 's ideology and he made it a rule , speak said that it was just a thought but those that copied it believed that the tutsi were not real africans and that they came from up there
there is another book by albert pages entitled ‘ au royaume hamite au centre de l' afrique ’ , that is where they all support ‘ au royaume hamite au centre de l' afrique . ’ that is where i said that the himites of here or the reign of the banyiginya or rwanda of the tutsi but i honestly do not think it 's the tutsi but rwandans .
it was followed by everyone else . when colonialists came , there came another problem , colonialist of two different kinds @: there came those whom i call of the trouser , that is to say civilians but there were also of the dress that is the priests . they came in collaboration with the priests and wanted them to help the rule africa properly , tell us about these people and the african we can use . and others said "@ is that what is difficult ? we shall help you
and dismissed all hutu and even tutsi who were short , and only the tall tutsi were left saying that they were the only ones who knew how to govern .
how do you think they made the locals leaders and how did the rwandans react to this ? that 's what i want to tell . first of all they removed the rwandan form of governance , where by the king was the over all ruler of the country , they removed the king and replaced by leopold who was a white man , and they would continuously refer to him as the king ignoring our king . the leaders became servants so that they could show that it is that and those who were doubting stop doubting .
the king who was there was musinga and when he did not agree with them they chased him away and he died in congo where they sent him after they realised that kmememba where they had sent him at first was n't far enough and he died at moba
they replaced him with his son rudahigwa , who had to agree that he was to be governed by the white man and was thus baptised . the priest classy had a role to play in chasing away musinga and putting in place rudahigwa , he had a big role to play even in consoling the tutsi at that time who were only top officials .
that is when they came up with identification papers .
i will talk about how they came and what resulted from it , the riots of 1959 i even have a book that talks about it here . in a few words and maybe you can ask some questions but this is how i can say it .
i would like to ask you a question , there are many people who follow laws that are not comprehensive or that do not exist or they confuse themselves about certain things because they do not understand . the king musinga was exiled in kamemba because he did not agree with the white man and after that as you told us they sent him into exile in moba in congo . it 's clear that there were some things that they did not agree on .
you see musinga was a victim of the truth , and that he was wise amd he was a man of honest character , colonialists came saying that we were stupid and had no brains , that we were animals and that was hard for him to accept and that was his crime . that 's what i think , other things maight have been because they wanted one who was easy going , baptized and willing to learn the white man 's things but he was old and they found that they could not get along with him .
so why did they choose thetutsi because yuo realise that the most of the problems we have today are from the colonial time because the white man made up somethings to help them with their plans but why did it happen in our countries ? the example i can give on only rwanda and burundi is that we were the only ones who had good leadership and they saw that they could not just penetrate us like in other countries .
i would have answered that later because we shall come to things of 1939 .
our misunderstandings are those things that came to be but i will come back to that problem in a while . honestly , if you take a close look at where they came up with tribes like you have said clearly , they came up with these tribes elsewhere but the problem became more complicated in the time they wanted independence . that is why i was proposing to talk about it later because they came up with tribes here but they came up with other things elsewhere .
if you look closely you realise that along the way the catholic church or should i say the priest did not behave propery because they evidently showed crookedness , what was meant to be teaching people the word of god became politics and things did not go well . i do not know what you can tell us in regards to the priest and church .
so as to simplify things , let us talk about it all , let 's talk about thing in 1959 because it is like talking about all these things because we shall mix things up and you will find that it is tiring . that is where we come to the priests and colonialists and ourmiunderstandings with them , it is speak 's ideologies and what i said before about befriending but that is something they needed to use .
they knew that they were telling lies but they honestly did not want to leave this place , they did not want to grant us independance , those are the things that became difficult as they tried not to grant independence . i think if one is to talk about that , there are many thinga that are part of it .
the little you have told us on the colonial period , there is a question we want you to answer on the catholic church . we shall talk about the riots of 1959 and the protests . there are those who call it riots , others call it a social revolution while others call it something else . tell us about it and those who had an active role in it . who did it ? , what was their goal ? who were they ?
yes , this is the of end result of all the questions . the problem became evident the day that africa got tired of being a slave , the time it wanted independence and stop being slaves . many people now know the history of africa and even read about it , that is an easy thing to talk about today .
in the berlin conference , that is where the white man claimed africa as their land to do with it what ever they wanted , they especially needed raw materials for their factories so as to make machines and every thing else that they would use . they found that africa had most of the things they could use and they decided on how they will share the world and africa was part of it . so the colonialists came here with priests and all the archaeologists and wrote the lengthy history of the colonialist which you all know .
there reached a time when africa seemed to be courageous and decided that enough was enough . there was the ordinary colonisation like ours , where they were not harsh but there are those they would take abroad like to america , asia , what they call slavery . we were lucky to have a man called rwabugiri who they named makare bwana mukare who resisted and fought , but later they came .
there is a book called ‘ mission au rwanda , ’ which was written by a white man called colonel guy logest who was flemish , i know him , he was here in kigali . he came from congo in 1959 for the first time , he was made the resident special . he removed all the leadership that was there and was colonial . he came with orders to remove those dogs who were the tutsi and were not even rwandans from power and put the hutu .
he therefore came and removed the tutsi without any reason and put the hutu nad he begun to burn
this white man burnt my home in buhoro , white men without any black are the ones who came to burn my home with shooting , what they say as 1959 ...
we saw that if the tutsi had had bad leadership , they would have removed them . instead they removed the king and put their oun king , rudahigwa without following the rwandan way of leadership . he was not a king who ruled , he was a worker like others headed by the administration , the name they gave him was ‘ mwami ’ , and there was ‘ umwami ’ and ‘ mwami ’ . in fact as we were praying in the church we would say that let us pray for our king leopord .
it resulted in the tutsi being considered as bad and colonialists who should be killed . those who were able to flee fled , you know that that is when refugees , burning and killing came into existence , saying that the tutsi were foreigners . it followed in schools and places of work and it resulted in the tutsi feeling as thoughthey were not at home . one can say that this did not get them anywhere , one can go through all these early governments of the republic if you wish that we continue .
in the history of 1959 that you have told us , there is a man who is often talked about who maight have played a role called peraudin .
i was a refugee for 27 years , bishops used to write in books saying that there is no more room in rwanda , that those who left should look for room outside the country . you know that every has has right in his or her country , in fact if the country has nowhere to settle its people , it looks for a solution . you would hear radio stations like rtlm saying such things like while people are listening .
i am not saying that there are no people in the church that were holy , they are there including amongst the bishops , there are those who rejected it and it 's there in what i write . there are those who clearly said it like bishop bigirumwami and many others but in general that is what i despise . there are others in the catholic church who did wrong things but they are human beings , this is where i always say we failed including myself because i am a catholic and a bishop .
that 's really a good question because i used to think about it a lot . it 's true after the belgians were defeated during colonialism ; it was taken away from them , the white leaders left . the french wanted to take over . basically they did n't want to give it all up .
there is something else that people say so often about kayibanda . the fact that he worked together with white people , that he was not rwandese and killing rwandans meant nothing to him . then he used it to bring conflicts among the hutu and tutsi with the help of the white man . kayibanda was really not rwandan .
he was neither tutsi nor hutu because he was not rwandan . to start conficts among themselves , with help of white people , i think it was fine with him .
it was fine with him but , he was n't going to say it because it would not be easy to say he was a foreigner and he is bringing conflicts . maybe he is the one who would be the one to say that you are not rwandan too however , he was supposed to hide that i think . maybe he did n't mind it but i do n't think the fact that he was from bukavu was enough for him .
that 's what i 'm saying . i am saying that he felt like first of all he was not hutu neither was he tutsi . to create conflicts with the help of the white man , for him he felt that even if all rwandans killed , each other it would be ok with him .
i think you can go on telling us about the attacks of the refugees . the ones who died because of being called their agents , how did it go ? i think even that would be part of it , truly , the genocide of 1994 itself ...
i think that that is when habyarimana and his followers and the other political parties that had the same ideology of sharing the power went to the peace talk of arusha , as whole planning of genocide went on slowly by slowly up to the time it was triggered , it reached a point where habyarimana accepted but you could see that he did n't really accept , they said it and he said it in writings , others said that they were going to plan a genocide and then you could see them sign papers without meaning it .
.... but the trigger of it all is the pretext of the plane of habyarimana , i do n't know who did it but whoever it is must have been the one who wanted to bust the first bullet of the genocide ...
i think that there if there is any other problem , i think even if someone can be can be cutting short the reason for the beginning of genocide i think , maybe you come to talk about those who wanted it and those who did n't want it . so you can understand who wanted it . who are those who wanted it ? they are sdr members , in real sense they are the ones who wanted all that in all times the ones who were behind him , who actually helped him were colonialists .
so i wanted to ...
they would say that he is an ethiopian and the short cut is through the river nyabarongo , and no one made a sound . condemning things , what was left was to check if it 's really possible .
like the ending to the other bad saying ; the more they shed blood , the more you get used to it and become fearless , when one gets so used to killing , it reaches a point where he is used to blood and he becomes like an animal , it 's high time .....
traditional courts ( gacaca ) of long ago and the ones of today can n't be the same because genocide ideology never existed then . what existed similar to gacaca , there used to be a meeting .... let 's say like a judgement of the communities .
it got a point and they said that it 's over for any tutsi , that he should die , i have forgotten ...... where were we ?
we were on gacaca comparing the gacaca before and that of today , if it 's true that gacaca will be productive and make the rwandan community rebuild itself
who are those who caused it they are the ones on top .... who punished habyarimana maybe whoever that warned him is the one who punished but they are many who followed it closely let 's say the ones who helped them i 'm not saying their names so they do n't think i need anything from them , i do n't need anything from them but .... those who helped them are known and they are mentioned in the news papers
there are those it will n't come out of , i do not know yet what caused it , why is there a hutu who was made to feel that his purpose is that a tutsi should not live ?
... it is useless to him , how will gacaca rehabilitate him so as for him to feel that he was poisoned , i do not know how gacaca can undo this because they taught them that bad people ... there is a person born in kajogera who used to terrorize ...
you were telling us about gacaca
gacaca will be better and it will arrive at the desired goal
honestly gacaca was the best prescription
and it 's the best , they are some things that will not be possible or that will be difficult
but this will be solved with time continues to teach .
and to feel that it 's not important as even to those who have will die in it , that 's where the hatred and the poison
because he feels that the genocide can not happen , and that feeling remains in him
that state of heart will not be attained very soon by the gacaca , it will come with time , people and so on
like the story goes , that he who time leaves behind ...
those generations were taught to kill for a long time
i think it changing because now those that are being born today are being taught good things and those that were taught bad things are growing old
i would thus like to ask the last question then we shall wind up , that 's all we will need . after the genocide
of 1994 , everyone who was present
who is alive today wishes to live in a rwanda that is harmonious without any divisionism
will develop or become a rwanda that 's doing well without any segregation . what message can you give those children
since they are the future of rwanda on how they will be able to build a rwanda that is not characterised by any form of segregation
there is no message i can give that you do not know about , what i see is that we should follow what we are taught
by our leaders that says that we have the same origin and are related so we should be one
and we get the satisfaction that we deserve , most of the time that stuff about segregation was said those who did not share
and called each other greedy
honestly , it is all just talk that we are related and al created by one god , especially the christians who are many like i was saying
many of those that believed in god committed crimes ,
it 's education that most important and that 's where people are taught unity
and whoever does n't understand , they help him understand , those that do not understand ... that 's what i can call it
thank you
we would like to ask you what happened during the genocide ; how you were called , how you responded , how you joined the attackers troops or if there is some one you strungled to death , generally tell us how you saw it .
besides the ntarama attacks , did you participate in any other attacks ?
it 's proven that there were several areas , which were attacked . but you participated in only two ; that of ntarama and nyarunazi . why did n't you participate in several others ?
do n't you think that there was a reason before the genocide , considering the way leaders motivated people into segregations . to the extend that , if one had a bias in the tutsi would ... ?
you have told us that you are thirty @-@ one years old . that means that you were about twenty @-@ one years old by then , because 10 years have passed . well before the genocide there used to be several political parties . can you tell us the one you belonged to ? how did you receive the idea of parties , you as a mature boy who was so strong to participate in such terrible ideas forwarded by the whole country ?
though you did not have any hatred for the tutsis . when mdr was teaching you how tutsis were bad people although you never used to hate them , would they teach you directly or indirectly ?
during the genocide what was your altitude about those political parties ?
what do you feel about people who criticise the genocide . people who deny that what happened here was n't genocide or who try to be sarcastic to the survivors of genocide ?
thanks a lot . i would like to ask you about those who participated in the genocide yet they are not imprisoned . you may not be knowing some of them but do n't you know those who were already convicted but still out there , infact here in the coutry ?
was he arrested ?
no , nobody knows where he fled . the other people that i knew died . but there is also another one who is out there yet he was also a local leader in this area . we normally meet and chat but he ran away from his home after he was released .
after being released he disappeared ?
yes , he disappeared .
where did he flee ?
he lives up there ... in the former kanombe commune . in case he is needed by the authorities i can get him face to face . i know his adresses .
does it mean you are ready to ... to testify about all those who ... that is the reason why i asked you about the leaders and educated people plus those , one can say that played a certain role in genocide . can you get those people ? because they also helped you and now they are out there happy .
in conclusion , is there a messege you can forward to rwandans in general or any other people who may have access to this testimony of which it may be those who participated in the genocide , and if possible to the genocide survivors .
could you please identify yourself ... ? i mean your name , where you were born ... ?
my name is ayirwanda gaspard . i was born in nyamagabe commune .
how old were you during the genocide ?
during the ... my family and i migrated to karama but i was born in nyamano .
i asked you how old you were during the genocide ?
during genocide ... i was 41 years old .
would you tell us the crime you are accused of ?
i am accused of genocide .
would you please tell us in details what you did and where you did it ?
i witnessed the beginning of the war of 1994 . and i will emphasize much on the murambi events . it was here in murambi where we were on a night patrol together with other soldiers . we were making light so as to reveal the enemy passing by .
would you tell us where the patrol was taking place ?
it took place in our home village in gashiha cell , in muganza sector in karama commune .
who organized it ? briefly explain to us about the patrol , before you tell us what happened in murambi .
a certain local leader whose name was anastase uwihanyanye organized it . he had got an order from ngezahayo the burgomaster . we patrolled with other local leaders in shifts and whoever would try to dodge would be punished . it was an order from the authorities that we should hunt for the enemy .
what was his name ?
what do you mean by saying that , "@ he is out @"@ ? does it mean out of the country ... ?
not arrested ... i mean they are not imprisoned .
but they are in the country ?
yes they are all inside the country but out of jail .
for how long did the killing take place ?
the killings stopped at 4:00 a.m. , when it was almost dawn . that is when the shootings stopped .
what happened afterwards ?
they [ interahamwe ] started looting their property and stealing bags from the dead bodies .
during that war that took place , which role did you play ? did you kill some people ?
the role that i played ... i killed some people .
how many did you kill ?
i killed two people .
what about those in your company , did n't you see them killing ... ?
yes i did . the local people we were with would get any tutsi who would try to escape and kill him or her with a club ... i was with them ...
if you consider the size of murambi , were you all on one side ... ? were you surrounding it all ... ? how was it ?
after the soldiers reinforced the [ murambi ] natives , they continued with the war .
i am asking you whether you surrounded the whole area or whether you were in one place .
soldiers are the ones who surrounded the area but citizens were just beside that house . but when the tutsis started running interahamwe followed them in that school and even in the homes they where they were hiding and started hacking them .
you personally , did you kill anyone you knew before ?
i did n't kill anyone i knew but there is some tutsi neighbour who was killed while i was seeing . even counselor budengeri was present . someone killed that tutsi a painful death while i was watching .
what about those you killed , how did you kill them ... how long did you take to kill people ?
the people i killed ... i hit him with a club and he died right way . the same for the other one , i hit him with the club and he immediately died .
what interval of time did you kill them ? did you kill them at the same time or it was at different times ?
i killed two people ... i killed them in ... as i 've just said , i hit him with a club and he immediately died .
what time was it ?
i killed him towards morning . it was around 4:00 a.m.
did you get time to properly identify whether he was a tutsi or not ?
i believe he was a tutsi because there was no hutu among them .
and when did you kill the second one ?
like this ... i killed both of them at the same time .
did you kill them in a few minutes interval ?
i killed both of them in a few minutes interval .
what if that person did n't die , would you recognize him today if you met him ?
i do n't think i would recognize him because there were people of all kinds . so i would n't know him .
you do n't even remember his looks ... ? are n't you able to say , "@ the person i killed looked like so and so ? @"
i think i remember what he looked like .
did you know where they came from ?
i did n't know where they came from ; they had fled to murambi .
did you have any reason for killing them ?
it was just because of the bad leadership that forced us to kill but otherwise i would not have killed them .
you have recently known that it was a bad leadership because now there is a good one . i believe if you had known before that it was a bad leadership you would not have killed them . therefore there should be other reasons that forced you to kill ; would you tell us some of those reasons that might have forced you to kill .
the reason i killed them is because the authorities ordered us to . they said , "@ there is only one enemy and you must kill him or her , and if you do n't , you yourself shall be killed . @"
from your personal point of view , did they appear like your enemies ?
we never had any conflicts between us . in fact i would n't have killed them if it were n't that they told us that if we did n't kill them , they would definitely kill us .
are you trying to say that if you had refused to kill then , you would have been immediately killed ? is there anyone who came to you and said , "@ if you do n't kill , i will kill you . @"@ ?
that is why i realized that what i did was very bad and reported myself . i killed innocent people who had n't done any thing wrong to me . that is why whenever i think about it , i become very miserable because i killed my fellow people yet they had n't done anything to me .
so if you had let them pass and you had not hacked them they might have been alive up to now ?
yes they would be alive . if i had n't killed them , they would be alive today . maybe they would have survived through god 's mercy .
so that means that you did it voluntarily and no one forced you ?
i was convinced by those people to go to that place . when i reached there my savagery led me to killing those innocent people .
so it was out of your own will ?
no one forced me , it was out of my own will and that is why i apologize for what i did .
how did you know the people you tormented and who are they ?
they were our neighbours just in the nearby area .
did you kill other people from that same area ?
yes there are some people i killed .
how many people did you kill altogether ?
from all you have said , it sounds like other people drowned that kid in the river , but you are saying that you killed him . so what do you mean ... ? what do you mean when you say that you killed him ? you told us that other people drowned him ; they tied him with grass made out of ropes but in no time you are telling us that you killed him ...
that child called kagina was taken and the people who took him killed him while i was there . which means that if they never killed him , i would have killed him myself .
did you help them ?
i did not help them . but i was just standing watching . like the way i 'm standing now . they drowned him while i was watching and we were together .
okay , tell me now ... the people you killed yourself how many are they ? do n't worry , if you do n't remember them it is okay .
the people i killed myself ... they are ... [ counting with fingers ] i killed three people .
those are the people you killed with your own hands ?
yes , those are the people i killed with my own hands .
there are the two others from murambi you told us ...
well , there 's another child i killed myself . after killing him ... i hit him with a club and threw his body in the river .
how did you see him ? explain to us .
we were looking for his father and failed to get him . but i saw the son . therefore i decided to kill the son .
were you with other people ?
we were three but i 'm the one who killed him . the other men whom we were together did n't . i am the one who killed him .
my question is , during that time when you were killing him , what was your main reason of killing him ? i mean , not now ... but then , what was going on in your mind ? how were you feeling inside ? what was your attitude ?
at the time when i was doing it , i had wild thoughts that made me think we were hunting ... wherever i saw a tutsi i would kill .
so you felt like you did not have any interactions with the tutsi ... ? i am asking you ... did you feel like you did n't want to interact them ?
by then ... imagine i had killed an innocent child who had n't done anything wrong to me ! you can see i am an old man ... that was really a very bad thing to do .
you mean there 's no one who is imprisoned ?
there 's no one in prison . at least no one from my family , maybe my neighbours .
you have told us that you killed the tusti because your leaders forced you to . so personally what did you think of the tutsi before the genocide ?
before the genocide , the bad leadership of that time influenced us . they used to convince us that our only enemy was the tutsi . so we were forced to believe it and yet it was not true . simply because the government was sensitizing us all the time .
when did they start telling you that ?
they started telling us that after habyarimana 's death .
we are asking you how you used to find the tutsi before habyarimana 's death .
before the genocide we would intermarry , i even have a sister who got married in that ethnic group . we were friendly .
so you used to look at them as if they were your relatives but later on you changed your attitude towards them ... i guess you know something about the war that took place in 1990 , is n't it ?
yes i heard about it .
during that time , did n't you see signs , which showed that in the future there would be genocide in rwanda ?
we could hear that there was a war going on towards kibungo . that there were people coming from exile who were fighting against the people they found in the country . but for us in gikongoro it was peaceful .
therefore , you never saw any signs of the genocide ?
i started seeing those signs after habyarimana 's death .
is that the time you saw signs ?
yes , that 's when i saw some signs
let me ask you ... you have just said that all changed after habyarimana 's death . which changes did you experience after habyarimana 's death ? and how did you handle those changes ?
after realizing what was about to take place , did n't you at least think of what you should do to help your neighbours since you had even intermarried ?
my neighbours ... when they heard about it , they all fled . some came here to murambi .
you told us that here in murambi was a horrible massacre . after the killings do you know of something else that followed in your home village ?
after the murambi battle , no more killings took place . the french troops intervened and stopped it .
did the french find any tutsi around ?
they found all the tutsi already dead .
it sounds like the french came to cover up the deeds of those who went to exile ?
yes they just wanted to cover up on what those people had done but the tutsi had already died .
do you remember when the french reached here ?
i do n't remember ...
maybe it was within a short time after the catastrophe that happened in murambi ...
they found when all tutsi from murambi had already died .
when you estimate , what time do you think it was ?
if i estimate ... the tutsi died ... i heard that the french had reached kibuye and within a short time i heard that they had reached gikongoro . but that was less than a month time after the tutsi had been murdered .
that is not what i was asking . i know you 've changed and you are a good person . but i was asking whether you remember what you did ... what 's the most painful souvenir ... ?
what i remember that always hurts me are the innocent people who were killed .
well , those who died were all innocent . but as a person who was in murambi , what would be the souvenir that you will never forget ? something you ever think about , maybe blood that dropped on you ...
what i can never forget are the people who died here , killed by wrong doers .
the thing i will never forget is seeing people being crushed by grenades . i will never forget that .
what happened ?
a grenade was thrown to them and they died .
how did they open the grenade ... ? how did you see them dying ?
what i saw about their death , they fell down and died slobbering . that is all i saw .
is that all you saw ? i mean the worst thing you saw ... it might be an event that took place in the twinkling of an eye ?
the two men i killed myself is the worst thing i saw happening in the twinkling of an eye . i will never forget that , in my whole lifetime . yet they were innocent .
what do you remember about that event , which always comes back to your mind ?
do you think about it often ?
yes i often think about it and it fills me with misery . because of those two men i killed yet they were innocent .
you personally told us that you killed . there are some events that you still remember clearly and you admitted what you were accused of . how do you look at that crime especially when people accuse you to have participated in the genocide ?
no one forced me to pleade guilty . i reported myself as my conscience did n't leave at peace because i knew what i did was very wrong . no one forced me i did it willingly . i reported myself in my home area and talked about what i did in murambi . i saw so many innocent people dying in murambi . wrong doers killed them although they had not done anything wrong . those people had fled to murambi . i reported myself about it before anybody reported me .
having participated in the genocide or being called a genocidaire , does it make you feel embarrassed ?
having participated in the genocide ... personally i feel that , i did wrong . and , it was due to the bad heart i had . later the government said , "@ you killed , tell us how you killed then we shall forgive you . @" then i thought about it and decided was going to say how i killed and then be pardoned by the government and by god . @"
you know there is something called ‘ justice ’ that is being practiced in rwanda , concerning the genocide that happened . so how do you think justice should be done ? how should they go about it ?
on my behalf , justice in rwanda ... i suggest that the government forgives me because i always try to simplify its work by confessing and convicting those who do n't admit their participation in murambi killings . i say everything truthfully and i help the government by telling what happened here and what i personally got involved into . therefore the government should forgive me . because i say the truth about what happened without giving them a hard time .
besides being forgiven , personally after all that happened in rwanda , what kind of justice should be done ?
it is ‘ justice ’ that unites all rwandans . so that we can build our nation and stop what happened from happening again . we should build our nation and make it look like it was before people died .
you have just talked about unity and reconciliation . what do you think about unity and reconciliation ? how do you expect it to work ?
i think unity and reconciliation should unite the rwandans so that they live in harmony the way they lived before . people should live with those they betrayed and ask for forgiveness .
do you think that unity and reconciliation are possible after all that happened in rwanda ?
i know it 's hard to unite and reconcile after what happened in rwanda . but again , the government is working hard so that people may say the truth about what happened in order to reconcile .
you have told us that you confessed ; now we want to ask you whether you asked for forgiveness to the people you hurt . did you go to them , especially the survivors ?
yes , there is a woman to whom i asked for forgiveness ; she was happy and she thanked me for having told her about the people i killed , she said she did n't know them . and then she said there was no problem with her ... i told her about who killed her family members and she said she did not know them .
what does it mean when one says there is no problem ?
she said to me , "@ i did n't know those who killed my relatives . now you have told them to me and in fact we are neighbours . @" she told me that they always deny that they did n't kill them . she appreciated me and said , "@ you say the truth , keep it up and do n't change . @" she told me to keep saying the truth like i had said about her family .
but i am asking you if you think it is easy ?
being easy ... people should forgive those who did wrong to them since the majority is ready to forgive . maybe those who do n't accept their roles in the genocide yet there are evidences should be punished because they do n't want to expose the truth .
you have admitted the crimes you committed and always regret what you did . now according to you , how do you find the future of rwanda ?
rwanda is no more like the former rwanda . children of rwanda today think about building their nation . they do n't think about doing things like what happened in the past . the government is teaching the children how to live in peace with one another , how to work ... i do n't see genocide happening again .
you know very well that rwanda lost so many things and very many people . so in case you were released , what would be your contribution as far as unity and reconciliation or development in rwanda is concerned ?
i think i would go and try to live in peace with the people i tormented and since i 'm a farmer , i would try to work with them as we try to help one another .
when you consider what happened , do you feel like you are a rwandan ?
yes , i feel i 'm a rwandan .
thank you , would you please remind us your name ?
my name is ayirwanda gaspard .
how long have you been in prison ?
i have been in prison for five years and eight months
thank you .
thank you too .
ayirwanda ?
yes please ?
such a person ... the majority forgives and others do n't .
i 'm asking you personally , i 'm not asking you about others . if it was a true story that happened to you , let us say one time you went home and found your child 's body lying there dead . can you forgive that person who may have killed your child ?
personally there is a time i forgave someone who killed my wife . now he has been released . but it was n't during genocide , that person used poison and she died . but later we reconciled and started sharing everything ; we would invite each other for events . therefore i would forgive him . my heart would be at ease to forgive him .
well that is all i wanted you to tell me . now would you tell us in brief , your life experience ; you told us that you have been in prison for 5 years and 8 month , which means you were arrested in 1999 .
i was arrested on the 26th july 1998 .
after the genocide stopped in 1994 , what kind of life did you go through ? please tell us in brief .
in 1994 after the war when all tutsi had died , people were wild . everyone in gikongoro was bad except me .
i want to know if you fled .
no i did n't flee . what hurt me were the neighbours i had whom i would no longer see . that caused me a lot of pain in my heart .
did you continue to live your life in the village like any other villager ?
yes i lived a normal life but i was n't happy at all because of the innocent people who had died .
in the place where you lived , how many ruined houses were there ?
where i lived , there were about six houses in ruin .
whenever you would see them , would n't they remind you of something ?
yes they would remind me of something because whenever i would like to send my children to my neighbours for some water , i could not because they were no longer there and yet there used to be people whom we would talk . it would really hurt me .
meanwhile , according to what you have said , it seems like it took long before you were arrested . but you are not telling us your life during all that period . from 1994 to 1998 ... until you were arrested .
what happened is that , the lady whose child i killed was a hutu but she had married a tutsi . so she reported me to the authorities and then i ran away from my home . i let my home and i would sleep in bushes .
when did she report you ?
she reported me in 1998 but whenever they would come for me , i would run away .
were you hiding in the bush ?
yes i was hiding in the bush .
near your home ?
near my ... i would go to a place called rukondo and then i would come back at night while no one was seeing . i would stay in the house for the whole day , and then go back when no one was aware .
were they arrested too ?
they were not arrested . they are out there in their homes . i am the only one who is in jail among all people we collaborated in the killings .
how were you arrested ?
how the arrested me ... they got me from home where i was digging . when they took me to the commune and imprisoned me . and when i reached there , i immediately i admitted that i committed the genocide .
who arrested you ?
the counselor arrested me ; the one who brought us here in murambi . together with the local leaders they arrested me . and that tutsi survivor who married a hutu lady .
you have told us that you were arrested by the counselor , is it the one who brought you during the time of killing ?
yes he is the one .
did you talk about it in the testimony you gave ?
in my testimonies and in my documents he is there . even in the testimony i testified in cyanika i mentioned him . that was in kibuye . in my document all of them are mentioned .
what could be the reason why they are not arrested and you have told us that some are leaders ?
i said it for a long time and they said that they will arrest them in gacaca but i do n't know why they do n't arrest them .
you as a person who s in jail , when you hear about such ... a leader in your sector ... it means that he is the one who gives orders yet he is supposed to be the one revealing the wrong things . you are very sure that you all participated in the genocide . what do you thing about your sector ?
if i were given the opportunity to go back to my area , i would go pointing out the people we were with and even though that leader is among , i would name him too .
i just wanted to know how you feel about the leadership in your sector in this time of your absence .
well , a place like my home sector , which is lead by a genocidaire , i suggest that person should be arrested .
i am just asking you what you think about it .
what i think about someone who is leading my home sector yet he killed , i guess he is doing nothing . i think he should first go to solidarity camps and try to forget what he did because he did many things .
so you think if he went to solidarity camps he may change ? or maybe he went there but you are not informed ?
he has not yet gone there . how can he go there yet he was not arrested ?
but there are camps purposely for leaders .
he ignored and never admitted what he did , unless the truth is revealed and then his crimes will get him to jail .
of all what you have just said what would you suggest ?
based on all i have said , my wish is to let people know that all the bad deeds i did were of the past government . and , now in this government of unity and reconciliation , i would like to testify what happened . and the truth i would like to show is how my heart was renewed and now i am human and i can live with other people . together we can build our motherland rwanda . we should reveal the truth about what happened and live with those whose beloved ones we killed .
who is kabombeki ... ?
he is the zambian ... anyway i do n't remember well which country he is the president of ...
is it thabo mbeki ?
had you ever confessed before they came to arrest you ?
no i had n't , but i confessed immediately after i had reached the commune .
but if you had not been arrested , would you have confessed ?
i they had n't arrested me , reporting and admitting my deeds ... if they had n't got me ... if someone convicted me saying , "@ you were with us during those acts of killings . @" i would immediately have accepted it .
what if she had n't known ? did you want to report yourself ?
have you ever seen people 's corpses that are lying here ?
i saw them ; they were very many .
when did you see them ?
i saw them in the morning when they had just died .
that time when the presidents came here , did you also go to see the corpses ?
when the presidents came , no citizen was allowed to go there . it was only the presidents .
but there is a rumor around that , after they had killed those people , did they rush to bury them ?
yes they buried them immediately .
what were they using ?
tractors .
did you play any role there ? did n't you come to help others ?
no .
but you got that information ?
yes , i got that news . i only know that information of how they were exhuming them from that place where they had buried them . the citizens had refused to ... exhume and rebury the remains . therefore , the current government ; this government of unity and reconciliation had to pay them to do so .
okay , thanks .
how they came ... they came on friday , that is how they came and then we saw a flame of fire we were at the market , they said that they were burning tutsi belongings then we moved a bit because the other side was burning , when we came that night we found houses had been burned and the neighboring houses were also burning and then i sat down , i had people to but people were no longer alive ,
they were not tutsis ?
who were those you told to go home ? were they tutsis ?
i stayed there with the others and i showed them where to pass . whenever i saw them planning on how to get on this hill . trying to know how people come .
who were those living there ? the interahamwe ?
did n't we go together ?
................
at muhamudus , at sezikeyes ! i took them there , and then when i got back i would skip a day . the next day something would itch and i would go back and say is it over crowded . i would smear them with medicine and take them home .
i want to ask you , the time the presidential guards came with the interahamwe , how did you do it for them not enter into the house ?
do you remember the number of people who were in you home ?
some came from kinazi ; they were coming from different places and another man who was from near here with his sister and her two children . if you want to love you start with your neighbor .
i want to ask you , for them to come here they knew that you were a traditional healer , did they know that you had other powers ?
they knew , because each morning i would say good morning and good after noon say and they could see people coming from all over to spend nights here .
coming for treatment ?
no , just visiting .
so for them to come here were after something ?
i used to treat most skin diseases , kidneys , gonorrhea etc i knew various medications for them but now days ...
so for you to be able to go and tell them that you use the nyabingi , what that ..........
my aim was not to see any corpse in front of me . i used to say if they die i will also die but i would him eat them .
among the people that you helped do they ever visit you ?
that old woman mariya , ever since we came from exile i use her plot to plant my crops because mine is too small , that 's how i survive .
no other ...
aa ! that man bourgmestre .
who ? bourgmestre wellars ?
yes , wellars , he provides for me , they say that i 'm mad that he was supposed to give me a cow but who would take it graze ? unless if i gave it to you and you bring me milk daily .
does he ever tell you how the other people you helped are doing ?
how old are you ?
i was born in 1912
that means in ...........
i am 90 something ...
two ?
two .
bikerinka was also killed ?
you see now your old and children have been seeing this . have you ever visited any place that went through the tragedy ?
the tragedy took place , i came from murambi
murambi
murambi
in gikongoro
in gikongoro
you looked and soon the tragedy that elapsed ?
up to now i am afraid , did n't i count ? were n't you there with me ? but you did n't reach ? i counted thousands , i counted forty thousand and they told me to stop , because i look a muslim among .
that 's it we are asking about the white according to what happened to rwanda do you think they played any role in that ?
no , i did n't see any white man killing .
but in history as time goes on they could have done something to stop it .
yeah , it 's history i also could have done like they can do , just like they saved us that 's what i can thank them , they saved us let them keep on saving us , save the leaders , save those that they are above , save like this , like they took my picture , they say that this old woman is insured
so i ask you another , what is your message for this not to ever happen again , what can you tell the people ?
just to pray to god
nothing else in the standard of living ........
it 's just to pray but for me i will n't live with them because they killed my child and later my husband .
so do n't you think reconciliation is required ?
let them reconcile , let them bring them out and after bringing them out , those who steal they catch him and shot him on spot .
you think someone who does something again like that should be killed ?
his to be killed because he says that i will kill and i will later be freed from prison , what will happen to me ? if you do something and your caught let them kill you .
that 's what you think ; you think there should be tough punishments ?
very tough punishments , some aside then says that somebody was killed , what he did we should n't do the same .
so someone like of long ago did you ever hear the racism things when they started ?
me ?
how did it happen when they were starting racism ?
someone who was greater than the other they would , they would talk about him and say that , that tutsi should n't live .
so those who were rich were called tutsis ?
yeah , he would be wealthy . when they could see you as a cultivator doing that kind of work ... then that one is a tutsi with cows , kill him and we still his belongings , then take over his .
so you can tell that this thing of racisms went according to how rich one was ?
it was according to what you had , in other words they were all like brothers and sisters and you had your sister and when you saw them being greater than you and doing something for that person and they gave them a cow and you like that tutsi is being granted that you should kill them .
then that can make you tell us how people killed each other because of property .
according to the property ... how they were ... you would set your eyes on your brother . when he become bigger than you and he worked for a someone that rewarded him with a cow , you say the tutsi has been rewarded . kill him . no other alternative
so to you see things that happened in rwanda
what happened in rwanda is from long ago
it 's beyond your imagination .
it 's beyond my imagination .
but still rwanda needs to live .
we need to live , who likes you ? now it 's difficulty , let them free them from prison , let them come home and build for those that they destroyed for and after that they live and anyone who put his head up they put him back to jail and never let him out .
so what about the gacaca courts you know it since long ago ? how do you think it should work now days ?
the one of today , listen many of those who killed are already dead ! some of them committed suicide even mine just near here on that street they buried them here on the yard they saw that they were left and said that his old woman is going to report us and they committed suicide
but what can you really tell us so that our gacaca can go accordingly and people live together ? mostly we want o know about he truth
truth , the truth is for them to bring the other machine
how is it like ?
it 's there do n't hide it from me , you do n't know that i am telling those who are in that camp bring them , free them and the put the machine on both sides and those who participated will be seen , and they should call me also .
really or you want to tell us in reconciling there those who were watching ?
there are those who were watching ,
or you want to tell us that the things of reconciliation there those who were observing it
there those who saw it .
on your behalf what do you think was the cause of the genocide to the people ... ?
selfishness , selfishness and wanting to have other people 's belongings , they could say , we do n't want this one , he is educated , he 's been to europe , my brother mussa twagirimana is stuck in europe . where he went long ago when they wanted to kill him and now he is still there .
so you think most of it is based on greediness ?
it 's greediness
so for that not to happen again what can be done ?
let them come and cultivate , let them come and work those who do bad things ... have accidents , he who says that i want this or i hate this is should be taken
what advice can you give us ?
you told us that you managed to hide many people , how did they survive ? where did you get what to feed them ?
it 's you who did n't want me to feed you and you also see what they were eating , beans , they were eating sweet potatoes .
where did you get them ?
just nearby !
your neighbors were n't helping you to .......
gosh ! those who killed , if you said anything they would report you and thus you would have given up some one . i could n't say a thing .
so you never asked for help from you neighbors ?
no , only one to whom i took people to .
what did you fear ?
i feared that they would report me .
how did you manage to feed these people for a month ? or they had little to eat .
but was it a month ? it was two months the last two months . i had beans , i had sweet potatoes . i cultivated , i was still young .
but there is also like those who used to get out and go ?
no , except the one that escaped , up to now he is in jail in gitarama because they rooted his belongings . he was a tutsi they burnt his belongings . at that time when he left they caught him and he gave them a bull for them to let him go so he was told to bet up a corpse . he ran off but now his in jail yet never killed .
so his in prison only for what he accepted to do ?
yeah , that is it , after we came home from exile . it 's me who went to the government told them to come and get the corpse from my front yard .
thank you
now they are alive that is what i know , only that ill have problems with the money you give me
what happened here ? the important events to start with . the first trench . the first trench is over there .
start with how everyone came .
what time did you dig ?
in beating they must have been people spreading rumors ?
people would have said it those who saw them going for shelter , and they would say that people go for shelter in there yet after we look for them we do n't find them , that was the puzzle .
people say that some were found in there hiding , and neighbors helped you . what can you tell us about that ?
that time when they found them , i had a big brother with some others like thomas and the citizens . they helped me and it led to nothing .
where were those whom they discovered ?
they were in this hole right here .
what caused them to be discovered ?
the daughter to murebwayire , she was tired of being in there and got out and when she saw people with machetes , she came back running and got back may be they were watching her . the people then saw her it was like at 1 pm , they came and removed the cover . the rpf had arrived in this area so nothing happened and no one was hurt . all the fourteen are still alive .
my name is mukarujugiro monique
i pledge allegiance to the republic of rwanda to work diligently
and fulfil the task that i am assigned with .
i swear to comply with the constitution and other laws
i will work at uniting all rwandans
that i will from heart respect the duty to fight for
rwanda without any form of discrimination
that i will never use the power i was given for my own personal benefit
i commit myself to the service of all rwandans
that if i do not fulfil this promise i will be punished by the law
may god help through this
before we continue i would like you all to stand up
in respect of all those who were victims of the genocide .
in remembrance of the outcomes of genocide everyone should come up with an initiative
so that our country comes out of such problems , thank you
you can take your seats
and then show us identification , journalist also .
i would the people in charge to check if these people are allowed to be here
the article says that a general meeting for the sector
has the responsibility to analyse the workings of the gacaca courts
in the sector , in the cell without interfering with court rulings
hold on a little bit , forgive me i told you about the general meetings
of the sector yet i wanted to tell you
about the general meetings of the cells
those who were abused by ..... those they played a part in what happened
it is said in this organic law .
the meeting is required to give evidence
and testimony against the all those suspected of genocide crimes
and others who had a hand in it
to study and pass the report made
by the gacaca court of kigali
all the locals who had a cell should explain
so that we help them reveal the truth .
we convict those who committed genocide crimes in rwanda
what we want is to live together in harmony
what 's most important so that we get to this is to put out
in the open what happened so as to give those that were victimised
their right to reveal what happened
this concerns us all .
you should take part in all the activities of the gacaca court .
made without first agreeing and exchanging
ideas , you have first priority
in gacaca courts so that the court is useful to the community
all either victims , suspects and others
in the well being of our country in the future
it 's important that you have an evident part to play
and become un corruptible and honest
crimes were committed and we saw it or were victimised
should follow the path of truth , the truth that is evident
because everyone says what they know
and be given the chance to say something
as the president f this court i promise before you
i promise that i will give everyone time
to say something
there are some articles that put in place rules and regulations governing gacaca
undefined
by raising his hand , the second
is the president gives that permission , thirdly
we should give time to those from far or travel long distances
the fourth the speaker should strive at speaking the truth
the fifth is no one should go irrelevant when given the floor
now we would like to remind those with mobile phones to help us
and turn them off so that they do not distract us
the sixth is its prohibited to mock , abuse , snicker
can have a chance to speak too . no one is allowed to bring an issue that does n't comply with the agenda
those were the 8 rules concerning requesting to speak .
everyone who does n't give or refuses to give testimony
about what he saw or what he knows as well as who gives false testimony
is tried by the court that gets hold of him
he is punished by imprisonment of not less than 3 months
up to 6 months . if there is a revisit of your case
he is punished by imprisonment starting from 6 months
to know something about a particular problem that others revealed
and remains silent
you are charged with , with holding of information
anyone interrogated about something in court
with prior knowledge that he has information on this or it is revealed
that he does but he refuses to say something
but remains silent and refuses to answer
the question asked . anyone summoned to appear in court
he is considered a liar . one who gives testimony
and adds on that he is saying is the truth and has evidence
then swears and signs for it
and its revealed that what he said was false
that he did it intentionally .
allow me to tell you that ...
giving evidence of what he knows that happened
during the genocide he lived herein gikondo
i would like to ask all the locals here
if you are aware that is a way turn yourself and confess
or to stand in for someone giving testimony
i would like therefore to ask if there is anyone who feels convicted by their hearts to turn themselves in
and confess because it has good out comes
for them and the family of rwanda
if we have time we shall give them time to confess
i would like to ask the second vice president
done before the court , let me give you the floor
fifty four , everyone who committed of the first category
of this law has the right to admit their crimes .
to confess to their crimes and ask for forgiveness .
asking for forgiveness happens in public when the oppressed are still alive .
and to the rwandan society so that the request to admit
confess and apologize may be accepted .
the accused confessing to their crimes must at first elaborate in detail
the victims and where they threw their bodies .
and the damages they caused .
to state the names of the accomplices and other felonies
in order to
confess and ask for forgiveness for the crimes committed .

and we have four children
i was born in maraba district in butare
i work as a lawyer and i am the prosecutor general
i would like you o tell us where you lived during the genocide and where you live at the moment
during the genocide i lived near here in gikondo in the new houses
right , left
that house is partitioned into two ; there is where i lived opposite safari 's .
the house was for the landlord and was divided into two
or landlord , oscar who worked in rwandatel
serushyana francois ... we first left altogether then we dispatched .
he remained in the one the side and went to the one on the other side , the other side which was opposite kayijuka 's was where oscar ruzagiriza lived , and he also died .
he was killed here
i now live in nyamirambo
i would like to ask first if what i am going to say ...
there are things that i think i saw but i can not be very precise because i immediately fled
both of them and prosper are here
i am called munyeshema prosper
he is the one with whom we were together as well as my brother called semigabo mucyo emmanuel
it was brother and ruzagiriza oscar who died
yes , i would like you to swear that what you going to say will be the truth
swear saying that i so and so swear to tell whole truth and nothing but the truth
i mucyo yohana swear to tell truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth
we can receive the testimony
the killing that happed i should had a number of things that preceded it before1994
before the killings
there is a day i do not remember
the day bucyana died
that time people climbed up to this area here
and as they reached here we were watching them
they had machetes small hoes and whistles
and some things that they sounded as the climbed where we lived
that time we said that , "@ but today seems to be a bad day @"
and we said that things looked bad
while we were still saying that , i do n't know where he passed
i think he will tell us something about that
people climbed up here with whistles
.....................
me and safari . safari said "@ mucyo , what do you think of this ? @"
and i said "@ safari for you how do you see it @" he usually had news about mrd
we remained there and the assailants climbed up with whistles
and machetes , they climbed over there and when they got we had remained behind keeping watch because there was no security
i was with oscar ruzagiriza
and my brother and he jumped over the fence i fell behind
that time we had said that in case they come where shall we pass ?
that 's what happened in 1994 , that time they jumped and went across
towards the methodists but people came knocking on safari 's door
and they knocked at our door as well because that time i had n't got time to jump over
they surrounded the place there then they dispatched and attacked at ...
they must have been people who knew .... that time
....................... .........................
i do not remember because they were young men from the area one the other side
what i know is that they entered and told us that the people they stabbed were the women they found in there
they did it in a short time , and they immediately run away
at ......... they had many dogs and they started barking
they barked and those who were there started ... you see , there were people watching what was happening there ...
who they said was the representative of sdr , a short light skinned man
with a bald head , many people liked to talk about him
those who were around , will supplement in 1994
on the 6th of april in the evening , people called home
and said that the plane and been shot down , i do n't remember who called
and he said that the plane of habyarimana had been shut down
that time those with whom we were together and with whom i also lived
and we were surprised
and said that this day we might be killed or flee
then morning came , when morning came
i saw safari because i was on the side that face his home
i stood on my side and he stood at his and we talked
safari said "@ mucyo do you know what happened ? @"
that i have no peace and i said that its all of us
and he said "@ things look bad so i feel i want to seek refuge at your place
i think he 's here . maybe safari can correct me if i 'm wrong .
that this is where you can have peace , and he came
with his family
they passed .... that separated us , they refused to pass outside
that people see us entering mucyo 's
darkness fell and we put a ladder over here and they put one over there
and was followed by the wife and 2 male children
there was no one girl at the time when they came home and we stayed there together
then we called so and so is dead
that time i remember there was a relative of mine who lived in nyamirambo who they killed along with her children
so we stayed there with the workers
my relative was called francoise and worked at the hospital
and she had a husband called sevuma vicent
they lived in nyamirambo near the person with whom serushyana the owner the house in which we live stayed .
he had another house in which they stayed that serushyana in nyamirambo and in front of it is where they lived
someone called they had shot her and all her children
it was around 11 o'clock
because they lived next to each other i told him , check for me because i have been told that they have killed people there
and he told me not ask him about cockroaches
in a short while that 's when we started the car
because we said that come what may they are going to attack us
we had to pick
who are those who can come ?
so it was either oscar or my brother
because when you were at home you could see behind as we had done during the time of bucyana
it was n't outside the door , for us we were in the house
so that we know who is coming
then we would go outside and stand in the compound behind then look outside
this way and the other way on the path behind
and we keep switching , so that we would see who was coming
after a while that young man ruzagiriza and emmanuel came and said that we have heard a car , a car is coming
the car came and stood behind while they jumped over
they jumped over where they put the ladder they fell behind
the children remained there with the his wife , the children got a problem
that 's what happened and they were wondering if they should go or stay with their mother , you could see that they had a problem
they were male children , i do n't know their names but they are men now
so the shooting continued and as they shot
if we are going to die we shall not all die from here so jump over and go
"@ follow your father , " said ruzagiriza . the others had also left
i remained with his wife , i do n't know if she is around and she said that you are not leaving me
"@ i will not leave you , but if stay in the house those shooting will shoot us from here @" i said
so i told those young men "@ climb over and follow your father i looked for my brother and saw that he had left
even the boy with whom we lived had left , that when the old lady told me that mucyo you are also leaving me
i told her that i was n't going to leave her and we looked for a place , behind there was a toilet , we entered and locked
and kept quiet , then we heard a car leave
when it left ....... she told me that we should n't go out
that if you go out they will kill us , i went to look over the other fence to see what had happened
because she could not climb over the other place and fall behind
i was looking for a place where we could hide
the one who is around , etienne munyabigoga lived besides us
he still lives there , i checked again and i heard the other coming come
where i left the other lady ...... they made hard for me , they shot and shot
they shot and made things hard for me , they left and we went outside to check
when did n't any other coming back ......... @"@ where do you think we should go ? @"
i told her and that there was a place we could go to
i was thinking of mukuza 's and i told her that if you feel we can go together , come and we go
after a while that 's when they started shooting at snd
and i said there is a place we were supposed to go , if you feel we can go together , come and we go
and she said that let me leave you to go i can see the others have left so you can also look for a place to go
........ i do n't know where they took her , maybe it 's ghazi ...
but they told us that they are going to the methodists over there
that 's when we started communicating with kayije who was over there and i told him that we should leave when it 's still early , he had also called me
we planned come back when its dark
in the evening that 's what happened , that time we told prosper over there , a young man who worked for us
to go ahead and check if there were people near there
and he sloped until he reached near here .....
there is a question i would like to ask you
those cars and those who were shooting there anyone who you knew ?
there was n't anyone we knew but they told us it was an army car
they shot but we never got to know them but i do n't know if there is anyone who knew anyone
for me i did not see them because that time we were together safari 's living room
the others are the ones who kept watch outside
manuel and ruzagiriza . later we came to flee and let mukuza 's
he could n't walk ...... they told us that he was killed
they attacked mukuza 's , i do n't know where he hid
but i do n't think he died from mukaza 's , that he climbed up
and passed by etienne 's and went to hide at a place where he had hidden at the time of bucyana
i do n't know where they were hiding
my brother who is here he can say he was the one with whom they hid
my brother is called mucyo emmanuel
that what they told me , they told that he was killed there
the person who told me this was called leopold , i do n't know if he is around
leopold who worked around here , where there was a bar called leopold .
i do n't know if he is still alive , people around here can help me
we met after when was alive
we would to know if there is anyone here who knew leopold
all his names ?
people knew he lived here
we reached mille collines
they said that we might be in the ceiling , yes i had left my car and they brought fuel and set it on fire
but that time we were n't there
we were in mille collines and i called etienne 's
and it was answered by his daughter that 's when i found out that they were burning our place , that they are burning your place
but what happened there even if i was n't around , but those two young men were around
prosper and is ..... they were around and they told me that after we left there were bricks
they removed and went in between and then covered it
in that they will tell us what happened . they burnt the place and finished
they were workers
who were around and they told us what happened
we left mille collines and went to kabuga
among the people there i was able to go with my brother
to mille collines and that 's how he survived
but that young man with whom we lived ruzigiriza did not survive
i would like the people who know how he died to tell us
that 's what they told us that they threw him in a hole
another thing i heard was that among the people they burnt there were some people who lived behind
that there were some night watchmen from mironko 's
that maybe who were told to hold some things and failed , iron sheets and all
whatever i forget the others will help me
i did not see a lot there we were at makuza 's that 's when i saw people jumping out
and i felt that many people had died
and those who were not able to leave died in it
you said your house was burnt , we would like you to give us a list of anything valuable that you did not take
even that car after the genocide , i found they had thrown it over here
thank you mucyo for giving us your testimony of what you saw and heard
during the genocide who can add to what he said , what your name again ?
prosper
prosper come and give you testimony or supplement on what mucyo said
even those who have been mentioned can beg for a word and supplement
the one who starts will give his personal details , your name , parents and date of birth
i am called munyeshema prosper , i was born at gikongoro in the district of kaduha
where did you live during the genocide and where do you live now ?
at the moment i live in kicukiro near my work place at the police station
first swear before the court that what you are going to say is the truth
you say that i swear that what i am going to say is the truth
i munyeshema prosper swear that what i am going to say is the truth
that i will supplement on what he said is that after he left
they burnt the other house , after he left some came and amongst them was a man called vincent
he was led the group of attackers and they said that they should burn the house because there is no where they could have gone
we put some wooden planks up and then covered with more bricks
all his belongings , his suits , everything was taken while were watching
i would like you to name anyone you remember
if you remember where they lived then tell us , if you know their addresses you tell us so as to make things easier
the man was called vicent but i do not know where he disappeared to
another was called kijyambere or maybe donati , i do n't remember what they called him
he was called rwajekare , yes he was called rwajekare
those are the people i remember
i would like the people around not to make noise
the house was burnt while were there , then they got the car and tried to open it but failed
after failing to they pushed it then burnt it over under the road
so the house burnt up as we were in the bricks , when it got dark that 's when we pulled ourselves out and went see a man called etienne
we went to see etiene and slept there besides his car in the compound
the small one that was there , then during the day we would sleep in the kitchen but he seemed not to take this well
he was n't happy about it at all
when we realised he was n't happy what we did was
she hid us
do you know zaninka 's other name and where she lives ?
we are neighbours up there but here there is boy who might know all her names
and we lived there , after which we fled together
and went to the police post , she called an relative of hers who was called ndindiriyimana
who did you say led you to refuge ?
he was called ndindiriyimana augustin who was a soldier
in the olden days and a relative to the old lady
i continued to congo
if there were any people you knew you can tell us
this is all i can testify , i do not remember
the car lowered and turned over , after i the war i found it below safari 's house
they burnt it , then burnt safari 's house and at kayije 's
everyone who can testify to this is around even etienne
thank you , you can sign your statement
thank you , you can go back to your seat
i do not remember precisely the day they attacked
because we left on the 7th and left at night
and went to mukuza 's where we spent the day , so they must have attacked at night but there are some people who can tell us
i do n't remember it but there are some who can tell us
also i would like you tell us when ruzagiriza came back to where you lived if you remember
yes , after he jumped , i remember i remember they disturbed me when they got back
but i saw my brother here and he told them because he was the one they were waiting for
he was the one with whom they were with
we went below the church
there was a white man who lived there , he might have been the pastor
and he seemed well acquainted with safari 's sons
a pastor of which religion ?
he was the pastor of that area because he lived behind the church
the church up here which was methodist
and they told us that they were going to seek refuge there
we remained behind the fence , there was a fence made of shrubs and we remained behind it
and let them in , after a while safari also went over
and he also entered but we remained outside because they asked to wait
they came to tell us after a while ........
he entered the methodist pastor 's place ?
yes the problem was that we would all enter an they would find us and kill all of us
that 's when his son went back and closed the door
so we remained there
what was that boy 's name ?
muhirwa
its muhirwa
so we remained there till evening around 3 o'clock and that 's when the shooting started at the parliament
so we remained in hiding there , i was at 5 o'clock when te safari 's came out
and i thought that they were going to see their mother , and they immediately came back with her
they entered and we asked them if we could also enter
and they said no
then it started to become dark at around 6 o'clock
they had attacked gatera 's
we got there when they had already left , no one was there
prosper is the one who told us that they had sloped to mukuza 's .
that 's what we asked him to do , to check this path down here
to see if we can pass
he went ahead of us checking for us and we got to mukuza 's door , they opened for us and we entered
we spent 2 days there
we left there after finding out that they burnt our home and killed kayije 's children and wife
i think this is where my testimony ends
thank you . go back to your seat if there are no questions .
what jean de dieu said i agree is what happened
but there is a decision i wanted to give
that day when the shooting took place and things looked bad
i called munyengongo .... and told him that things looked bad
can i send you my children for refuge
and he replied that you are not afraid ?
there is kayije claudine , kayije francis , kayije line and kankundiye francoise
so i went looking around to make sure there would be problem along the way
i sloped with them and they got there
i stayed home with the older boys
remained with the boys kayije jules and kayije ......
and their mother mukamutara venansiya
i got to mukuza 's
and spoke to the wife saying that it would be good if you remained with the children
when we got to mukuza 's we stayed there for 2 days as mucyo said
we communicated with them by phone
i spoke to my wife on saturday mornings
we spoke and she told me that etienne told them that since we used to go out
that things were not good
and i told her to patient i will come and pick and get you in the evening
.............................................. ................................................
i would like to ask the court to stop here ......
we got to mukaza 's which we left after 2 days it must have been a saturday
and went to mille collines
we went to mille collines but because there were many people
we entered in groups , there are some people who remained who were the near cars there
that time i entered in the first group and oscar remained
they came back for the second group but he was left because there was n't enough room
would mucyo like to say something ?
i wanted to talk about where i parted with that comrade , so the rest will speak after
the car came back , the person in it asked for ose the brother to joshua
that "@ where is ose ? @" i was next to oscar that time
i told oscar that we are the ones who were now he car is back , this is our chance
to go because this place will be attacked and it was clear that this would happen
because the interahamwe were passing below where we were in trucks pointing at us
and everyone was jumping over mukuza 's which showed that they were going to attack the place
i told him this is our chance to escape come and we go
he delayed and yet this needed to be done fast because everyone was running saying that it was only one car that had returned
also people started saying that those from kanzayire are being killed so people are jumping over the fence to mukuza 's
i stood with him and then told him "@ you see
they are going to attack this place we should look for a way to leave
others have left and might not come back and we left here @"
that we should look for a way to leave and that we met the car coming back
when it came back and said ose people sloped in big numbers so that they could get in
and i oscar that this is our only chance , if people get in before us we will not be able to leave
he fumbled around and i left , i remember at the door way and i turned around again and said , oscar you are staying here
but after he said everyone else came
that 's when he told me "@ for me i 'm leaving so you should go and if you live then you live and if i live then i live @"
where it was coming from was it supporting you ? what kind was it ? was it from the army ? was it for a relative , what was it ?
it was a suzuki but makuza would know better
however it was a suzuki because two groups were taken and many of makuza 's cars were taken but what came back was a suzuki
i think is some else who can give a more detailed account , so honourable president can you give mucyo 's employee permission to speak
i am called udahemuka silivani and i live in kimihurura
so you should swear that you are going to say is the truth
i could say that what happened this neighbourhood as he said before the slightly genocide
happened as we were watching
me and a man named prosper lived there together
and what mucyo told us as were together there
as they tried to commit the killings we talked about it together
because the night habyarimana died he called us together in the sitting room
and told us what to do and we immediately dressed up in what we could wear at that time
about those car that came , because i could only describe what i saw i agree with prosper
..................... me and prosper hid in a small room
on the fence it was made of bricks
we cut through the bricks and entered when we saw attacking our home
there were something up and we put bricks on top and entered
when they entered the compound and there was the car of this man jean de dieu
and in the house the phone was ringing and they said without doubt these people are in this house
they tore the doors down and entered oscar 's place where they threw a grenade
we could look through a breach between the bricks and look outside .
we did not know how he died , as that man prosper said we were together with the other old lady in the house
after this man etienne betrayed us and told us to look for a place to go and leave
what happened at etienne 's place , had you sought refuge in that place ?
mucyo 's place was burnt and by evening it was properly burnt
and we saw people coming to loot while were still that house
i told prosper that this place is being looted a lot
"@ hold on etienne betrayed them and can you can you explain yourself to them ? @"
when night fell and we went to his place hoping to knock at his door because it was dark
we went to his place but decided not to knock at his door .... under a rundown truck
when we saw it was morning that 's when we knocked at their door
his wife and daughter were around and they covered us and put us in the boys quarters near the toilet behind
i would like you to give the names of his wife and daughter if you remember them
i do not remember them very well but i feel people who can help me and tell me
the wife brought us some tea and told us that they did not know that where we there and we said that we were , etienne was not around
i short while etienne came and found us there , they told him there are some boys who live with mucyo
he entered the house .... but when he got out we could already see that we were an inconvenience
after telling him this prosper got out of that boys quarter that we were in and called the old women who lived next to etienne
the old woman could get up , i do not remember her name
i do not remember it , it 's been a while
"@ old lady we have asked for assistance from etienne and he has betrayed us @" we told the old lady the problem we had
"@ come and live here there is no problem @" she said
we stayed there until someone noticed that we were the only ones left in the neighbourhood
i do n't know if that person was a relative , i do n't know if it was a friend
he was called augustin , he was the chief of staff of gendarmerie
another thing that i can add concerning the man oscar who lived next to this man
i personally when i was still with prosper that woman 's house we never left the house
but people passed outside who interahamwe running that they were going to kill people and passed above that house
i heard them say "@ that man with long legs who lived above here , we put him in a hole over there
blow the pastor 's place , " that the one who lived with the dark skinned man , and it is this mucyo jonah who they were talking about
it was oscar they had killed , when i eaves dropped on what they were saying as hid at the old lady 's place
did you see where they were going ?
i was in the house and the person i told this was prosper that they are talking about a man with long legs and dark skinned , is n't it oscar ?
what i was able to here and follow up is that
you may stop there , there are some people who have questions on what you were talking about
when he came after around 15 minutes he knew that we were around and he jumped behind the house and then into the house
and found us there and because he knew us he told us that help me and leave this place and find a place to go or something
and that when me and the man prosper came to a decision
and the youngster who worked for the man oscar because we were together
where is he ?
they shot near the house of this old lady and the people who fled . they run away and he also left
because i was into politics for a while
from 1991
hold on i would like you to introduce yourself briefly if you want to supplement
i am called safari stanely son of gashumba paul and nyirantezimana florence
i was in 1982
right now i live at kinunga in the district of gikondo , i am a senator in the senate of rwanda
i would like to be given time to give a detailed testimony
right now i will talk about what my neighbours were talking about and i will even give dates
that was the last meeting of political interests that was help in rwanda and i presided over it
there were supposed to be many people from pl especially ...
even mdr and psd who were not "@ power @" were not able because they were stopped along the way and beaten up .
they brutalised most followers , even those here in kigali were stopped
i was the stadium holding a microphone with radio rwanda around
i tried and talked to the few who were there until my throat was hoarse and i could see that i might be killed
i sent one sent one benoit living in electrogaz houses next to the stadium to call twagiramungu and agatha
to inform them that if they do not remove me from there they would kill me , they were tired to get there as well ........
that 's the last word i said that passed on radio rwanda . those in need of it can find it there { radio rwanda } they must have recorded it .
i had a brother at the university called ... who told me that he had what i said and actually he left the university that day and did not sleep there .
i slept at agatha 's and called home telling them how the situation was ; i do n't know how they handled it .
i think i came back on a sunday the 20th and on monday they shot gatabazi felician .
i remember i was in my living room and i heard my wife saying that what she said has started
the 22nd was a tuesday as honourable mucyo jean de dieu was saying
that morning , { 22nd } they killed bucyana at mbazi next to their place and behind their place .
we did not know they killed bucyana though those of snd got that place
they spent the night shooting but we were n't aware of what they shooting at ... there at kimihurura but we did not know what it was .
that when they killed at gikondo on 22 february 1994
they killed 53 people on gikondo hill
that 's when one gakwaya , a tutsi was killed and another woman next to bucyana 's place . i do n't recall their names
those counted dead on this hill of gikondo are 53 people .
maybe on 22/02/1994 , i was supposed to be the first person killed .
even gatera karipoforo , i can say that i did not know gatera was alive , he has already been sentenced to death
claiming that him and rwigema spent the night shooting in kigali town
then it 's said he heard people trying to bring ethnic divisionism
they is a way they said and you got what they want to imply
safari they were saying that they are coming to kill me at exactly 11:00
because we are interested in knowing the truth about the genocide , i want you to reveal their names
i do n't know the names of those people , but he { my brother } told me they were speaking "@ urukiga @"
my wish is for you to spell out the names you know , because it is a good example
because if others testify while not revelling the names , it will be a problem as we shall not get to the truth
he did n't tell me their names but he told me that they were speaking "@ urukiga @"
safari
safari at 11:00 ? and he answered , "@ at 11:00 @" i asked whether he has proof of what he was saying and he said "@ i 've told you you 'll be killed at 11:00 @"
i ran out of ideas and became very confused asking myself what i can do . and he told me , "@ flee @"@ . ‘ where can i go ? ’ i asked , " i do n't know @" he answered
i remember he asked me whether i had some money and i asked my wife , "@ do you have money ? @" i told her to give it to me . all the children were at home .
my daughters and sons ran to his place in remera and he gave us more money
i asked myself where i will flee to and my heart told me to go to my place of birth
i was wondering where i will pass ? what if "@ kugiti cy'inyoni @" is locked and i 'm known by the people of kimisange ?
i fought mrnd and came back here climbing there at the top next to rebero and passed through kariyeri and i came back to kamisange
your honour i 'd said that i will give a long testimony because you can see that i know a lot of things
it is then that we were attacked after he told me , i fled
i passed through the same paths i told you earlier , to that place under that .... and crossed
later they indeed attacked as he had warned me . they came home and destroyed and they broke windows
they went to gatera 's and raped one gloriose , i normally see her around .
she will tell you what happened , what i wanted was to tell you was that at that time we were attacked by people selected from here , gikondo .
i later learnt that fupi son of gakara was among the assailants . in fact i one time met him
he was among the assailants
where did you live ?
close to here at a place called salo , behind here , all residents of gikondo know it , all those you are seated know it
i knew only those who were among the attackers
i could say 53 people died in the genocide
there a times we refer to the people of 1994 together with those who died
you said that they were victims of the genocide , i would like you to explain this
they were victims of genocide because i know that despite the fact that they called it revenging bucyana , but bucyana was a sdr
cdr was a political party that openly hated tutsis with divisionism , they killed tutsis then
when w ego there , i should skip the part when habyarimana died
habyarimana died and i found out around 9 pm
i went to gatera karopoforo 's and asked him if he knew what happened and he said he did not
that the plane was shot down , "@ we should we flee to ? @" he asked and i said we could pass butamwa up to bugesera
because i have a land there and i felt the locals could help us cross over the lake
that 's what i thought at that time and he wondered whether we should go and see kayije in the middle of the night
i climbed up and woke kayije up and talked but failed to come to a decision . in the morning there was a law passed on radio that no one should leave where he is
we stayed in the house and at 11 o'clock on the 7th a woman from ndera came
"@ who told you that ? @" i asked "@ by my child in town @" she answered
i started to feel more scared and i told myself to hide at kayije 's
...... the woman told me "@ going to kayije 's , is far you see passing in front of my place up to in front of kayije 's
i can not dream of it @"@ ... the fence was there and he was also being sought after and i could not go there
up to when i felt those with whom we shared a problem were the ones i could flee to
i decided to go to mucyo , i could go twagiramungu 's with whom we were neighbours
but i never thought about it , and that 's when i fled to mucyo 's
i remember he the time he called nyamirambo tears filling his eyes
there is another time when they came to my place during the day with soldiers to kill me but did not find me there
that 's when i climbed while hiding in bushes , i think with the oscars but we did not flee together
but we did not flee to the same place , some gathered together and others did the same
they fled to the bushes ..... they gathered in the bushes and the children followed me and we gathered there
in the evening i saw someone draw the curtain
that 's what the other youngster said , a white man drew the curtain and i went ... and the children and the white man said that we should not leave the house
he called the msgr and asked "@ what 's your name ? @" i told him and he said "@ there is someone called safari who has come to seek refuge here what should i do ? @"
ruhumuriza said that if they find out that he is a round they will kill you
i think it was god who led me there .... a bag , and murenzi sloping conversing and my heart told me
you should hide there , i could see a big house behind but that 's not where i hid , i had at that one 's place
up to when i survived , honestly that is what happened , what i want to explain is that on the 7th
the 12th .... i was surprised at 10 that you are going to be killed
they attacked at another time but no one in the area was killed
i think if they had seen me they would have killed even if they had seen karipoforo they would have killed him
that what they had planned on the 22nd of february , after that date was a whole different story
they did not discriminate they killed in row , that all i wanted to add
for the methodists and when night fell they threw a grenade in it
people died in it while i was lying in the corridor and he told me to sit in the corridor with my legs straight
and i sat and he came and told me that where you refused to go , you were right they are killing people there
that 's all i wanted , to add on the testimony concerning the date 22nd
and the 7th only of april of 1994
i would like you to repeat what happened on the 22nd
there is a point where you said "@ at first you wanted to flee to kayije 's but it was far
and i went to mucyo 's @" and you added "@ i was neighbours with a man called twagiramungu
what made you do this ?
listen , he was with mugezi so do you think i could seek refuge from a man who was with mugenzi knowing that we did not agree
did not trust him because he was amongst .... people with whom we did not agree
that 's not all , even the time of bucyana they destroyed my house
during the time of bucyana we had gates that were connected
during the time of bucyana we had gates that were connected
i wondered could n't it be that when they come to kill the do not mistake his place for mine
that 's what i thought
on the 7th , i was at ..... it 's like we were watching them , it was the 7th of april 1994
it was around 1 o'clock because honourable mucyo had people keeping watch
because when i called him that i 'm coming to seek refuge at your place and he told that "@ do n't come forward @"
that there are people watching
because they watched us they thought we had n't gone anywhere and were still in our houses .
the day before yesterday is when i came to know this when i went to kigarama to testify .
in the gacaca court of kagarama i found out that twagiramungu who was my colleague who was my neighbour
burnt my house because they thought that i was in the ceiling but i did not know that up that day .
yes we shall call you so that give a detailed testimony .
testimonies related to the crime of rape are not given in public .
any witness ...
let 's try to restore the society .
this restores rwandan society in some way .
in order to achieve this , gacaca courts have been established as a strategy .
in gacaca courts each and every rwandan is required to tell the truth
about the genocide , what he saw , his own contribution and what he has heard of it
investigating on its implementation , perpetrators ,
as well as its damages , so that this may serve as a foundation
and then give us courage to really restore the society
in reconciling rwandans , the tripartite people
so that they may live in good relations again , so that they may live together again being aware of what had broken them up .
it is within this context that we always gather here all
in order to remind each other what happened all over rwanda
especially in rugenge sector .
during the genocide , rwandans often went to hide in places where they used to go to pray god
thinking they would find the very god who used to help them . however it was not the case ; most of time they were killed there .
those places are catholic churches and others .
particularly , many people died in sainte famille .
as you will be realizing , it remains even unknown to some that people who died in the church .
they had come to hide ; others joined them and went to the church courtyard .
some who went out were killed and others were thrown grenades at .
some were picked one after another and killed . i hope by today we will listen to
followed the events , heard , saw what was being done in this city of
kigali . the most important thing we want to know is
the information about what happened what will help us know what i was just saying above
and lead us to reconciliation and rebuilding of our nation .
normally we want this information to be delivered in its full truth .
there are three things @: what one did , heard and saw .
among people present , there are eyewitnesses and those who just heard of things .
rwandans here present are looking forward to making known the truth and making it available to the public
as it has been said , it is made up of eighty @-@ one gacaca court members
from seven cells , the sector court and the court of appeal . that is nine times
nine is eighty @-@ one . for the moment they are to preside over the session .
i would like to let you know that this sector of rugenge
has been selected among gacaca courts trial sectors . the information collection step is already finished .
trial proceedings started some days ago what means the judges have gained some experience .
they are good at law and penalties as well as all other related issues .
as it has just been said , today is not scheduled for trial proceeding ;
the cession will be chaired by the presiding judge of the court in front of us .
in his power and wisdom , i would like to go over to him
and ask him to chair the cession as empowered by the law .
i hope you will give constructive ideas
to provide us with good and full information that will help restore our nation
and take it from the chaos it was plunged into . thank you !
it will also help us be aware of consequences of genocide and the role of each and every rwandan in order to fight against them .
thank you ! be seated please !
tell the truth and it is forbidden to disturb him @/@ her ,
to insult people , attack or intimidate them . the speaker should not be brief
and give time to others .
no one should go beyond the agenda
set by the court so that we may all respect it .
here is article 29 in relation to respecting gacaca court activities @:
providing information is an obligation to every rwandan and the refusal to this
as well as refusal to say what one saw or knows is punishable .
one year in prison . shall be considered as having refused to give information about what he @/@ she saw or knows
any who will have kept silent while he knew something about an issue talked about by others
and was present .
any who will have been asked to give information about what he @/@ she knows in the court when it is known he really has some
and kept silent , and discovered later that he really had it but did not reveal anything
or intentionally refused to answer a question asked to him ; any who will have been summoned
by the court and did not appear without reason so to avoid being asked about anything
while it is clear he @/@ she received the summon , shall be considered as having refused to give information
dishonesty is addressed during trial proceedings of the case in which
the prosecuted person gave his @/@ her testimony in case it is discovered he intentionally told lies .
article 30 provides that any who will be known of putting
pressure and threats on witnesses or gacaca court panel members
shall be sentenced to three months up to one year in prison .
in case of second offence , the guilty person shall be sentenced to
six months up to two years in prison . shall be considered as putting pressure on the court
anything intended to getting it involved in anything different things from its attributions be it in physical actions ,
in this respect , the president might stop any speaker who does not respect the usual way of holding speech .
when need is , the president of the cession might as well apply
article 38 in relation to rape ;
the raped person chooses among the members of the gacaca court panel .
as it has been demonstrated ; major general munyakazi , in the time , i think
he was still major ; was in charge of the gendarmerie at sainte @-@ famille . rutabana in question
is one of the people who escaped fights at gisozi . he and his colleagues came
and formed a fighter group at sainte @-@ famille . they had guns . of course they were not trained .
to explain to us his relationship with rutabana , how the two groups
were established at sainte @-@ famille , how people were killed .
that is the reason why we have called him as a witness .
we have not called him for trial .
unfortunately , he received the invitation belatedly whereas he himself had asked
to share with us some experiences at the level of nyarugenge district . now , we may go over to him .
in case he is needed somewhere else such as in cells , such institutions will invite him
on their own . without delaying , we go over to him .
the floor is his . he should start by what he did .
eeh thank you gacaca court panel members ! my name is .........
major general munyakazi . i was born in kinihira district
in 1954 , i am married to
mukamanzi monica with one child . i am in charge of the second division
operating in byumba , mutara and kibungo . dear gacaca court panel members ,
i would like to thank you for the opportunity you 've just given me so that i may give my testimony
we would like first to remind you a kind of practice here
we want you to swear first of all
you shall say @: "@ i , such @-@ and such , swear to god that what i am going to say is true @"@ .
i major general munyakazi , swear to god that what i am going to say
is true .
you have not told us your parents and the sector of origin so to know you well
my name is ... eeh my father 's name is rukera and my mother 's nyirakabanza .
both my father and mother died in the genocide . my did as well .
i live alone with my houseboy . the cell is bugerera .

so that we may take notes
i wanted to give my testimony to gacaca court in march .
meanwhile , on 13th and 18th , the government of rwanda
sent me to addis @-@ ababa in a mission so that could not be available .
in march from 4th to the 9th i was sent
to mombasa in mission as well . i could not be available for the whole week .
i went to see the mayor of nyarugenge district .
i asked him to give my testimony because it is my right as a rwandan .
he first gave me the appointment of april , 30th 2005 .
i would give my testimony on this day of community work
on the seventh may i talked to him in person
he is here himself . i had not received any summon from the tribunal . i personally took the initiative
that is why on the sixth
may , he wrote a letter to me after having considering
in brief what i did between the first october 1990
and the thirty @- first december 1994
in july 1990 i was studying in belgium in the ecole de guerre
i came back in july and i was appointed to the president of central record keeping
of the national gendarmerie . in august 1st ,
as you already know , the rwanda liberation war broke off . on 23rd , 24th ,
and 29th march 1991 the nsele agreement was signed
from april to september 1991
i stayed in gommu but because of the conflict between rwanda
and burundi . the war was likely to take place from january to april 1992 .
in 1992 i was appointed to cpgl security standing
grouping officers from rwanda , burundi and zaire in order to study the resolution of the conflict .
from april 1992 to august
not only i stayed in both the commission and gommu but also
i went to staff headquarters from time to time in the third office where i worked .
as you know , in july the arusha agreement was signed .
general oparelle from nigeria . from november 1993
to the fourth 1994
i was in charge of camp muhima and the commander of the mobile group that operated in camp muhima
called in the time kigali mobile group
on the 4th july 1994 , i left the city and exiled to
congo , zaire in southern kivu where . i was living in bukavu boronge refugee camp .
i came back to rwanda on february 28th
1995
and travels
try to be slow in your speech
the first thing i want to highlight is that
genocide started in 1959 and kept being planned and executed by the government of rwanda .
i mean the governments of rwanda during the time of mdr parmehutu and mrnd .
i will show how the genocide of tutsis was planned and executed
from october 1st , 1990
to the 4th 1994
from the first october 1990 to november 1991
the president of the republic was habyarimana juvenal
the government was made by of ministers who were all from mrnd .
from december 1991 to april 1992 ,
the president was still habyarimana juvenal , the then government headed by
nsanzimana was made of mrnd and pdc .
from april 1992 to july 1994 ,
the president was habyarimana juvenal and the government headed by nsengiyaremye
the president was habyarimana juvenal and the government headed by uwiringiyimana
was made of mrnd , mdr , pl psd and pdc .
from 6th 1994 to july 4th 1994 ,
the president was sindikubwabo , and the government was headed by kambanda .
i also want to show you that after the government exiled , it kept on
attacking rwanda in order to resume genocide from where it stayed in the time .
i also want to show you strategies used to make possible these killings in rwanda . i will show as well , in my testimony , that the killings that started on april 6th had been planned .
as you may have just realized it , i saw all of that all along different services i was involved in . this is what i am about to tell you right now .
the period going from 1959 to july 1st 1962 @:
during the period going from 1959 to july 1st 1962 the genocide of tutsis was carried out by mdr parmehutu , aprosoma using hutus so far considered as the majority .
the then policy aimed at chasing tutsis out of the country and exterminating them . the genocide of tutsis started in 1959 .
many books show that the killings started in the very period .
yes , the genocide took place but neither the un nor foreign countries took appropriate measures to punish the perpetrators in that time .
during the period going from july 1st 1962 to october 1st 1990 the genocide was carried out by the government of rwanda with mdr parmehutu and mrnd . the government established the policies briefly detailed as follows @:
it established the politics of exclusion aiming at chasing tutsis out of the country in 1962 , 1963 , and 1973 .
in 1982 , the then government of rwanda refused the repatriation of rwandan refugees living in uganda . the government of rwanda raised troops at the boarder in order to shoot at refugees intending to come back . this is real .
the genocide of tutsis took place but neither the un nor foreign countries took appropriate measures to prosecute those who carried it out .
please sir , we would like to ask you the copy of what you are telling us and start precisely from 1994 on april 7th to the 31st 1994 .
please , i beg you not to muddle up my message ! i need to be calm because there is a logical sequence of events in it . this is just an introduction . i am soon starting october 1st 1990 . i only still have two lines .
i think you are getting my point @: i must provide explanations about the period going from october 1st 1990 to 31st and i have to introduce it .
i would like to go on , if you allow it , without dropping out this introduction .
we need to work together so to follow our programme
we have told you three things to talk about @: what you did , what you saw and what you heard . you will start by what you did . if there is not tell us there is n't or you will ...
from 1959 , the government favored killers of tutsis . in other words , it enthroned impunity toward any who kills a tutsi in rwanda . the government of rwanda and mrnd , the then leading party , refused the repatriation of refugees .
as you 've just asked me to , i am now going to tell you what i saw and heard , in the following lines . i mean the three points you asked me to develop .
the government of rwanda in power since 1st 1990 till december 1991
had major general habyarimana juvenal as the president of the republic and ministers from mrnd as it had been for many successive governments by the way . the genocide of tutsis started on october 1st 1990 .
the extermination of tutsis started being put into practice on october 1st 1990
the government of rwanda and mrnd , the then leading party , started killing tutsis in rwanda because every rwandan and all leaders at all levels adhered to mrnd hence had to execute the orders from the mrnd central committee and its president .
on october 1st 1990 , the strategy of bringing fake accusations against tutsis started being used by the government of rwanda and mrnd who faked the charge of betrayal against tutsis so that hutus might exterminate them in very short time under pretext that tutsis who were in rwanda collaborated with inyenzi hence had to be arrested and killed .
tutsis were wrongfully accused of keeping guns and bullets to kill hutus all over rwanda . they were wrongfully accused of keeping inyenzi 's guns and bullets and having transmitting and receiving sets to communicate with inyenzi . all this intended to arresting and killing them . it was said that , in their murderous operations , tutsis had identity cards model iv drawn and printed in sisi evariste 's printing house
so that inyenzi might kill hutus who had identity cards model iii . tutsis were also wrongfully accused of having dug graves in their houses in which to bury hutus after killing them .
the government of rwanda headed by habyarimana lied to rwandans and foreign countries that the rwandan army had just beaten inyenzi and their accomplices having invaded kigali and that the invaders had been caught with their guns and many bullets as well as transmitting and receiving sets . it added that in case one needed proofs would go to see them at gikondo police station .
in kigali , the arrested people were taken to nyamirambo stadium and had to be killed in the shortest future because they had been called the enemies of the whole country . here is the high @-@ ranking staff of far ( forces armees rwandaises ) [ rwanda army forces ] similar to one of the unities in kigali .
in the president 's office , the president was habyarimana whose private secretary was sagatwa . in the military intelligence , there were such people as nuwayezu and simbikangwa .
the commander of the republican guard was lieutenant @-@ colonel nkundiye . all of them were from gisenyi .
g3 @: lieutenant @-@ colonel rwabarinda and g4 major ngirumpatse .
the gendarmerie staff was headed by the gendarmerie chief @-@ staff and army chief @-@ staff habyarimana , the mrnd president . the gendarmerie deputy chief @-@ staff was colonel rwagafirita who was also the president of the central committee . g1 @: colonel ngayinteranya , g2 @: lieutenant @-@ colonel rutayisire , j3 @: colonel hakizimana and g4 @: major nsanzimfura .
here are unities operating in kigali @: the commander of kanombe military camp was colonel bagosora , battalion commander was major ntabakuze , junior battalion commander was major ntibihora , the ordnance commander was mutabera , colonel bagosora , base commander was major nubaha and the head of health department was lieutenant @-@ colonel baransabitse .
esm ( ecole superieure militaire ) [ senior military academy ) : the director was colonel buregeya ; the air force department was headed by colonel ntahobari ; in kami military camp there was bararwerekana ; in kigali military camp , major ntizigirwa whereas kacyiru military camp was commanded by lieutenant @-@ colonel nyuragabo and the mobile group by major rwarakabije .
in october 1990 , colonel rwagafirita who was a member of mrnd central committee and gendarmerie deputy chief staff always said that all tutsis living in rwanda had to be killed because they were the enemies of the country and accomplices of inyenzi .
according to them , all tutsis had to be arrested and killed in the shortest future without any trial . he always said that and it was realized that he told it french confirming that tutsis were in small number , that they would easily be killed . he said it in the parliamentary report submitted to general jean valle who was in charge of the french military commission .
he [ general jean valle ] also told the commission that he had known this from rwagafirita himself .
in october 1990 , colonel serubuga who was a member of the central committee and rwandan army chief staff said that he had just found the alibi to kill all tutsis on october 1st all over rwanda . he always said that , confirming that tutsis were the enemies of the country . he even said it to french in his own words that tutsis would all die .
it is clearly stated in the parliamentary commission report that the then ambassador to rwanda said that he had been told those words by colonel serubuga . clearly both colonel serubuga and colonel rwagafirita who commanded the army and gendarmerie headquarters had already told french that tutsis would be killed .
even in october 1990 the then defense attache colonel rene darny wrote in his report that seven hundred thousand tutsis would die in rwanda in such a way that the issue was raised in the french parliamentary report .
the reason why people were not exterminated in 1990 as it had been planned is that other countries and embassies put pressure on habyarimana and obliged him to release people showing that they were innocent .
when they went to gikondo police station , they realized that the guns , transmitting and receiving sets were just a story invented to put fake accusations on tutsis .
that is why i wanted to deeply explain this problem in order to make you understand well .
during all this time , that government carried out genocide of tutsis . it carried out the genocide of tutsis in october 1990 in mutara and byumba . it carried out the genocide of tutsis in january 1991 in kibirira , gisenyi and the genocide of bagogwe in january 1991 in ruhengeri and gisenyi .
other countries started denouncing those killings by the government of rwanda . however , the government of rwanda and mrnd refused the agreement of nsele signed on march 29th 1991 and kept planning the extermination of tutsis in rwanda .
from october rpf had always denounced that genocide of tutsis carried out by the government of rwanda and headed by mrnd for successive terms . mrnd members were present in all positions in the government of december 1991 till april 16th 1992 .
the president of the republic was major general habyarimana , the prime minister was nsanzimana and ministers were mrnd members . the prime minister was from pdc .
the government still rejected agreements and went on planning the extermination of tutsis in rwanda .
the government of rwanda kept on killing people and in march 1992 there was the genocide of tutsis in kibirira , gisenyi , in bugesera , and kigali ngali .
the government formed on april 16th 1992 and reshuffled in july 1993 had major general habyarimana juvenal as the president of the republic and nsengimana as the prime minister . this government was made up of ministers from different political parties @: mrnd had 9 , mdr 3 , psd3 , pl 3 , and pdc 1 .
from march to june 1992 , the president of the republic habyarimana , the government headed by nsanzimana , and the government headed by nsengiyaremye kept carrying out the genocide of tutsis in gisenyi and elsewhere in rwanda , as i have just demonstrated it above .
rpf asked the government of rwanda to cease the killings and decided to stop the genocide in rwanda .
the government of rwanda accepted to stop killings in bugesera , kigali ngali . the government and rpf signed arusha agreement on july 12th 1992 .
mrnd , cdr and some officers in favor of mrnd were not happy about the agreement of the 10th and 30th october 1992 and 9th january 1993 concerning the power sharing in the government . they accused minister ngurinzira from mdr of being rpf 's accomplice since he had granted to rpf the ministries before occupied by mrnd .
those ministries were the ministry of interior , the ministry of transport , the ministry of health , and the ministry of youth .
in january 1993 , the president habyarimana and mrnd continued the genocide of tutsis in kibirira and kibuye .
on february 4th 1993 , rpf asked the auo [ african union organization ] to tell the government of rwanda to stop the genocide of tutsis in gisenyi , kibuye and all over rwanda . it also said there was enough force to protect rwandans who were being killed not later than three days from then
rpf did it and on february 8th 1993 it decided to start the war intended to stop genocide all over rwanda .
mrnd refused to go to bujumbura and continued the plan of exterminating tutsis in rwanda . on march 7th 1993 dar @-@ es @-@ salaam communique signed between rpf and the government of rwanda was issued .
as you know , mrnd and cdr rejected the dar @-@ es @- salaam communique and continued their project of exterminating tutsis in rwanda .
the government in power from july 1993 to april 6th 1994 comprised major general habyarimana as the president of the republic , uwiringiyimana agatha as the prime minister , 9 ministers from mrnd , 3 from mdr , 3 from psd , 3 from pl , and one from pdc .
on august 4th 1993 , rpf and the government of rwanda signed arusha peace agreement . after the signing of arusha agreement , mrnd and cdr continued to refuse the agreement of power sharing with rpf . during that time , mrnd and cdr continued to stay away from those agreements and maintained their programme of exterminating tutsis and rejecting agreements as well as training and equipping their militias .
after august 4th 1993 , mrnd , cdr , alongside mdr power and pl power , continued the programme of exterminating tutsis . the president habyarimana refused the establishment of the transitional government and national assembly .
the government would have 21 ministers and the national assembly 71 deputies .
the president habyarimana was afraid that 48 of 71 deputies would make decisions and that 14 of 21 ministers would decide as well . that is why he wanted to have 1/3 plus one person .
in the national assembly there would be 11 deputies from mrnd and other 13 of whom he thought 6 would come from mdr power , 5 from pl power and 2 from other parties . 5 ministers would come from mrnd , 3 from mdr power and 1 from pl power .
the part of far on the side of mrnd , cdr , pl , mdr power supported mrnd 's , cdr 's , pl power 's , and mdr power 's militias in such a way that it supplied them in war equipment to use in the war of exterminating tutsis in rwanda
those protocols of agreement of october 10th 1992 and january 9th 1993 talked about power sharing .
the protocol of agreement of august 3rd talked about power sharing in national army and gendarmerie . there were some soldiers who said they could not work with tutsis and inyenzi in the national army and gendarmerie .
from 1960 to december 1993 , people from gisenyi and ruhengeri constituted the majority in far and occupied very important positions in all domains in far . they were not happy about hearing that the government headed by agatha uwiringiyimana would demobilize their officers due to the principle that had just been set in relation to sharing 12 positions among 11 prefectures of rwanda .
the government headed by uwiringiyimana agatha decided that each prefecture would have one place except gisenyi that would have two . this decision caused discontent in soldiers from gisenyi and ruhengeri who turned against the prime minister uwiringiyimana agatha given that those decisions had been made at the level of every prefecture .
rwandan army 's seats to transitional government were shared as follows . rwandan army ruhengeri @: chief staff a1 major general nsabimaana ; byumba @: brigadier commander colonel bizimungu ; kigali city @: brigadier commander colonel gatsinzi ; kibungo @: deputy brigadier commander lieutenant @-@ colonel sebuhire ; butare @: deputy brigadier commander major gasarabwe .
national gendarmerie in gikongoro @: colonel rutayisire ; deputy chief staff in cyangugu @: major bavugamenshi ; kibuye formation commander @: lieutenant @-@ colonel nzapfakumunsi ; kigali formation commander @: major nsanzimfura ; gitarama formation commander @: commander ndereyimana ; gisenyi formation commander @: major munyarugerero and major nzabonimpa had been appointed .
from january 5th 1994 , after the president habyarimana swore , there was a bad atmosphere in politicians and far soldiers . on 8th january 1994 interahamwe of mrnd , impuzamugambi of cdr as well as other young men of mdr power made a march in kigali city and at cnd showing their strength and that they would exterminate tutsis who lived in rwanda .
in the government in power from june 4th 1994 to july 4th 1994 , the president was sindikubwabo and the prime minister kambanda . in the night of 6th to 7th april , the government of rwanda headed by kambanda that was composed of mrnd , mdr power , pl power and others continued to plan and carry out the genocide of tutsis all over rwanda which cost more than one million lives between april and july 4th 1994 .
the strategies that was prepared since october 1990 . on april 7th 1994 , rpf inkotanyi decided to stop the genocide . on 4th rpf inkotanyi stopped rwanda 's genocide , they stopped the genocide all over rwanda .
strategies used to exterminate tutsis include blacklisting them in order to kill them . here is the problem you usually encounter probably . i am going to tell you all of that because i have come here for that .
blacklisting tutsis and bringing fake accusations against them so that they get killed by hutus , publication of ten commandments of hutus so to make the latter hate and then kill tutsis , convincing hutus at all levels that any tutsi living in rwanda or in exile is an enemy that needs killing , setting barriers in all paths even in cells all over rwanda so to hunt every tutsi and prevent him from escaping , searching houses in order to find where tutsis might be hiding so kill them ,
giving out guns in the population of all communes all over rwanda which guns were to be used in order to exterminate tutsis , establishing militias interahamwe of mrnd and impuzamugambi of cdr intended to kill tutsis on the barriers and where they might be hiding , training interahamwe and impuzamugambi in order to invade houses of religious people of the catholic church , churches and schools where tutsis might have gone for escape so kill them in a very short time .
convincing hutus that they are above tutsis and that killing the latter , raping tutsi women , burning their houses , seizing their property shall not be punished in rwanda . blacklisting tutsis was a strategy that started being used since 1961 and 1973 by mdr parmehutu .
the method was also used by mrnd chaired by habyarimana juvenal on october 1st 1990 . the president 's office had an intelligence department that kept the lists of tutsis to be caught and killed at once because inyenzi had invaded rwanda .
i think i have already told you that on october 1st 1990 , the government of rwanda used the strategy of charging tutsis of fake accusations in order to abuse their reputation . i will repeat it because the very accusations took four years .
no , people are making noise . you may tell them to keep quiet !
please hold on ! hold on please ! remember the instructions we have already read . let him finish .
on september 21st 1992 , chief staff nsabimaana told soldiers in the army that every tutsi living in rwanda was an enemy .
this ideology had already existed since 1963 and had just been put into writing by the army staff . political parties such as mrnd , cdr , mdr power , and pl power with their lists had convinced their members that a tutsi is an enemy to be killed . in order to locate the enemy and prevent him from escaping , barriers were set in all paths in cells of rwanda . houses and bushes were also searched to se where a tutsi might be hiding and kill him .
this method was used since april 6th 1994 till july 4th 1994 and cost many lives of tutsis in rwanda
because the population in cells was ordered to settle on the barriers , be on patrol all nights looking for a tutsi in order to kill him . this method was called self and common defense . this was just fancying other countries so that they might not denounce it but the method was actually intended to exterminating tutsis in rwanda since it had been put that a tutsi is an enemy to be killed .
guns had also been given out since october 1st 1990 . the guns intended to exterminate tutsis . the establishment of mrnd and cdr militias was illegal as far as rwandan law was concerned . interahamwe and impuzamugambi were also trained . from 1959 , tutsis had been escaping to houses of religious people , churches and schools of the catholic church and could survive
because the population feared to kill tutsis in those houses . mrnd and cdr trained interahamwe and impuzamugambi to attack those houses , churches and schools of the catholic church and kill in very short time the tutsis in .
now here is what i saw at goma when i was exiling with far people though people may say that is not necessary , i am afraid ...
april , june 1994 till july 3rd 1994 , officers who were in the army and gendarmerie staff command are the following @: in the time bizimana was not in rwanda . bagosora was the principal private secretary .
in the army staff command , there were regions . mutara region was commanded by lieutenant @-@ colonel karyabwite and byumba region by bizimungu replaced by lieutenant @-@ colonel ruvugabagabo . gisenyi region was commanded by lieutenant @-@ colonel nsengiyumva whereas rusimo was under nkwiyekubona . butare was commanded by gatsinzi later replaced by muvunyi , gitarama by lieutenant @-@ colonel habufite , bugesera by ntabakuze . nyanza was under gasarabwe , cyangugu musonera , and kigali region was commanded by colonel muberuka whereas overall command1 was under colonel ndahimana and command12 under nkwiyekubona .
in the capital kigali , there were many unities and commanders @: one for kimihurura military camp , one for kigali military camp , one for kanombe military camp , one for esm , one for muhima military camp , and another for kacyiru military camp .
killings . political parties such as mrnd , cdr , mdr power , pl power and governmental administration kept conspiring in the capital kigali . as far as the killings of tutsis from october 1st 1990 to december 31st 1994 are concerned , the reaction was that all reports showed that those killings were carried out by the government of rwanda together with far , authorities at all levels as well as a big number of the population .
i was the head of central record @-@ keeping from october 2nd 1990 in the capital kigali . in my duties , i drew a report to the gendarmerie chief staff and the minister of defense saying that i had not caught a single tutsi with model iv identity card so far said to be held by all tutsis in rwanda , what was just an invented story .
the second thing i did is that i drew a report saying that we found no spool neither in sisi evariste 's printing house at kicukiro nor in other tutsis accused of keeping them and giving them out in tutsis so that inyenzi might distinguish them from hutus . those accusations had been brought by the central intelligence department of the president 's office . munyakazi munyakazi i drew a report saying that there was no gun found , illegally possessed by a single tutsi because there were tutsis who possessed guns that they had been given by the government
i reported that no gun stores , bullets , transmitting and receiving sets were found in tutsis ' houses . i also went to gikondo police station . i found out that the guns showed to be taken from tutsis were worn and greased . they were kept in small stores of the rwandan army . we asked gendarmes who were around . they told us that the guns had been brought by gd soldiers commanded by lieutenant @-@ colonel nsengiyumva . we met there some agents from embassies who had come to see the guns
i handed it in to habyarimana 's regime
is it before the war ?
yes , before ! i told you that it was on 4th and 6th . that is the time when we met agents from embassies , which started putting pressure on habyarimana saying he was bringing fake accusations against tutsis in order to have the alibi to kill them .
i do n't know whether you are through so that we may ask you another question !
not yet . i 'm still developing what you have asked me about ....
try to tackle questions you 've been asked @: what you did personally .
of course that is what i did personally !
that was just reports ! what would you tell us about the genocide ? did you do anything ?
on april 6th 1994 i was the commander of muhima military camp and kigali mobile group commander . the mobile group was a unity of the national gendarmerie in charge of protecting radio rwanda , rwanda television , rwandatel , the national bank , and minadef .
i say it once again @: as the mobile group commander , my duty was to protect radio rwanda , rwanda television , rwandatel , the national bank , and minadef . as the commander of muhima military camp , i had to protect muhima military camp .
do i answer your question about what i did ? what i did as the mobile group commander is to give the order to gendarmes to protect radio rwanda , rwanda television , rwandatel , the national bank , and minadef as well as the population and religious people who were in saint @-@ michel cathedral .
go on
in saint @-@ michel cathedral ....
you have just said what you did and the duties of gendarmes under your command . now we want to know ; what was your role in all that ? you have absolutely said you did not do anything wrong . would you explain to us ?
in saint @-@ michel cathedral ... in saint @-@ michel cathedral ... the gendarmes under my command succeeded to protect all the people who escaped to saint @-@ michel cathedral . i protected religious people and all others who came there . displaced people who were at gisimba 's were taken from nyamirambo to saint @-@ michel cathedral because it was known that it was protected by gendarmes under the command of lieutenant @-@ colonel munyakazi .
let him talk so to explain what we will ask him . you are allowed neither to laugh at him nor to acclaim what he says be it false or true . you shall be given the floor when need is !
the gendarmes of the company protected hotel de milles collines . they were with lieutenant @-@ colonel mwangi of minuar .
on june 27th , the army staff command displaced people who were ... those who had stayed were displaced pretending that other activities were to be established there . it was said french would come to settle in kigali . in that time , the territory company had no responsibilities because the hotel had just been seized by rwanda army staff command
on the 10th , hotel de milles collines was repeatedly attacked by interahamwe militias because it sheltered people called rpf accomplices . however , the gendarmes of the company together with the mobile group who were at hotel de milles collines , as i told you , fought against interahamwe
on june 17th 1994 , the interahamwe militias came in a very big number and succeeded to enter the hotel . they broke doors and started getting people down in order to kill them . i was called and i went there . i found two families that had just been taken to the reception desk to be killed . i may even tell you the families so that you may ask them yourself .
there was the family of murindangabo embroise and one of habiyakare . they all saw that i was coming for their help
when i was at hotel de milles collines on 17th , there was father uwimana the priest of saint @-@ andre parish who had escaped to saint @-@ paul center but went to hotel de milles collines after . he saw me at the hotel ; i even gave orders to go for help to people who were at saint @-@ paul and sainte @-@ famille and chase interahamwe who were going there to kill them .
father uwimana told me @: "@ i can see that you still have a human heart to help people . i want to beg you one thing ; i want you to go for help to people who are at saint @-@ paul center who are going to get killed by interahamwe . they are at father vermerie 's @"@ . they were sitting down in the caves at bishop vermerie 's .
he had been with the people in saint @-@ paul all the day , refused to be taken with others and went to bring fake accusations against me in the church saying that i was going to kill those i had taken with me . all those people are still alive . investigations have proven that . they are all alive .
because i was at saint @-@ michel cathedral , on 18th and 19th i was asked by priests to take saint @-@ vincent and assumption sisters as well as religious brothers who were in procure and bring them to saint @-@ michel cathedral so that they might stay together . i took all of them to the cathedral . nothing bad happened to them . they are all alive , invite them ; they will tell you . i did not harm them .
meanwhile , the gendarmes i had transferred to saint @-@ paul center and sainte @-@ famille had another duty given to them . it had not been evoked but we have to evoke it for the moment . displaced people comprised two parts @: there were displaced people who were for the government outside the church , to the primary school and to joc . these ones could walk without any problem . there were others who were hiding in the church and saint @-@ paul center who could not have neither food nor water .
father hakizimana , praised for having helped a lot displaced people , together with father galican as well as other priests they were together , told me the problem . they said that they sheltered displaced people but did not have means to get water and food . there were interahamwe there and they could not leave so to bring food from caritas stock at nyamirambo , saint @-@ andre and ... the place where the church built a very big house
they asked me to give them gendarmes to help them get food for displaced people . i accepted that gendarmes at saint @-@ paul center and sainte @-@ famille went to fetch water for the displaced people . they even went to bring food for them . even though these things are not often evoked the priests who were there may tell you that the gendarmes did that work .
something else i did as far as helping people is concerned is running a secret operation with father hakizimana . in our secret operation , we were well @-@ suited that the food would be taken from sainte @-@ famille stock and sent to king faycal hospital and hotel meridien through red cross because there was no food . we wanted to secretly take the food from caritas stocks at nyamirambo and bring it in the area controlled by rpf . we would proceed like that . we did it exactly that way .
priests who present , that is the secret . you have been asking what we did . i , lieutenant @-@ colonel munyakazi , accepted to send in a deep secret the food eaten by people in king faycal , in hotel meridien . even my seniors asked me about that and i denied it because it was a very deep secret . you can see that i was a good @-@ hearted man ; i did not even want people to starve
do you think you are through ? have you said that the mobile group at sainte @-@ famille and saint @-@ paul ...
definitely !
was n't it that way ?
i gave orders
alright ! before that , i want to start by the reason why we had invited you though you did not get the invitation ....
i did not get it
we want to know your relationship with ... as you explained , there were two groups at sainte @-@ famille . one of gendarmes of course under your command , and another of the population who were armed . was n't it that way ? did you explain it that way ? you had the responsibility to protect people as you said . how come that there were armed people killing others who were running away because of their ethnic group ? i think you all know that . you have also explained it .
i am afraid you have not understood me well ! i told you that i commanded the mobile group . i also told you that the mobile group watched over saint @-@ michel cathedral . do you get me ? i told you there was no problem at saint @-@ michel cathedral .
i told you that the gendarmes protected the population there . whether gendarmes went there from time to time , whether they were connected with them , captain ntirugiribambe may explain it to you better . i ensure you that i had no connection with the interahamwe who attacked sainte @-@ famille church and saint @-@ paul center .
do you accept that many people died at saint @-@ famille and saint @-@ paul sir ?
of course ! i do know that people died there
so , the task you had given to your gendarmes was to protect who exactly ?
the population , yes i know !
which population ?
one that had escaped there
in the church and at saint @-@ paul center ? isn ’ it ?
tell me first what those reports are so that i may have the idea of those accusations brought against me as you are saying .
i just wanted to explain to you so to have the same understanding of things . this is not a trial . it is just information collection
you have just said yourself that this is not a trial ! on june 17th , i read in newspapers that i headed the interahamwe 's attack to sainte @-@ famille . it is impossible @: at that time , rpf had carried out an operation and took people from saint @-@ paul . the interahamwe became angry and decided to attack all institutions . they attacked hotel de mille collines , sainte @-@ famille church and tried even to attack saint @-@ michel cathedral .
as a commander , i already told you what i did . i was told that the doors of hotel de mille collines had just been broken and that people had already been taken up to the reception desk . this was my reaction @: i quickly ran from muhima military camp to hotel de mille collines . i immediately brought the interahamwe 's attack to heel and the very gendarmes chased the interahamwe who were taking people from sainte @-@ famille church and making them enter the procure .
you can see well that saying i headed the attack is pure lies because i was at hotel de mille collines . here are even people who saw me . i can see them here . there is uwimana and others . i was not part of that attack ; i was at hotel de mille collines .
we would like to ask you a question sir ! still about saint @-@ michel , can you really confirm that no single individual died there ? i know one who died there . his name was semuhungu . he worked in the national bank ... i mean banque de kigali . i think he first worked in banque de kigali and shifted to the national bank after . the man died there .
okay , let 's just forget about that one . let 's come back to the issue of sainte @-@ famille . you have just confirmed that you saved people who were in saint @-@ michel and hotel de mille collines because the gendarmes could protect them . why did n't the gendarmes protect sainte @-@ famille and saint @-@ paul center and let such people die ? talk about that that very minor issue then we give the floor to the audience and listen to their views .
i told you that the gendarmes i sent to mille collinnes , sainte @-@ famille and saint @-@ paul belonged to the nyarugenge territory company of kigali formation .
do you mean that protecting sainte @-@ famille and saint @-@ paul were not within your duties ?
they were under nyarugenge territory company of kigali formation
who was the responsible ?
each formation had its own commander
what was his name ?
his name was lieutenant @-@ colonel kanimba . he was there temporarily but he normally belonged to kacyiru military camp
what about what you said that you once arrived at sainte @-@ famille and saint @-@ paul ?
of course i did
did n't you realize anything strange ?
i was with father uwimana from hotel de mille collines . we went together to father veneche 's and we carried people who were hiding at father ... bishop veneche 's in the pickup . this took us two rounds of times .
please sir ! we learnt from the case of a prisoner going by the name of rutabana that he killed one 186 people picked from the church where gendarmes settled . there was a barrier too ; can you tell us that you really arrived there ?
i arrived at saint @-@ paul and mille collines !
do n't you think you can explain those things to us ? i mean the 186 people killed on that day . you know ... when only one person dies the whole area can get informed in one day . did you never know anything ? explain to us !
i told you that i was at hotel de mille collines . by the way , why are people shouting when i am explaining ?
they should keep quiet . keep quiet ! we are about to give them the floor . we only want you to explain that minor issue .
in the testimonies you received people said that i headed the attack ! i told you that on june 17th i was at hotel de mille collines . we had been fighting the interahamwe there all along the day . from there i went with father uwimana to pick people from father veneche 's .... bishop veneche 's . i carried them in two rounds in my pickup . surprisingly , mp rugema said that i was going to kill them .
there were your gendarmes
i did n't know it
eeh ... i got it ! the man and his family died . he lived near saint @-@ michel
according to the report i had from the priests , no one of the people who had escaped to saint @-@ michel cathedral died . i was told that .
let 's go on ! let 's give the floor to the audience and listen to their views . you have actually talked about everything . let 's now listen to the population ; you will get their views as well
allow me to add something !
try to be brief
in a word , i would like to ask you to carefully investigate this case . some days earlier , at the tenth anniversary july 2004 , all the survivors who were living in that area praised the government authorities for having saved them . their representative said @: "@ you should also thank also lieutenant @-@ colonel munyakazi who came to us for help @"@ . you may make noise yes , but i am not lying ! the division commander who delivered the message is here himself ; he might explain it to you .
it is one because you are telling the population to come and accuse me . the very people who were praising me just some days ago !
i did not mean to accuse you , sir !
they have just thanked me and sent a message to me saying they thanked me .
that is a good thing . any who has done something good should be actually thanked for it . i have not said that people must accuse you . we only have to let the two sides speak . we go to the court panel first and listen to their views .
i think that his intention was to support you and show you that we are not meant to accuse you . he also reminded you that , as a leader , you should have known the death of the people you have been asked about . that is his point . we go over to someone else
thank you . i never drove that red bus . i had a white hilux pickup . even my driver belonged to the national gendarmerie . i never travelled in the red bus . you can see it is someone else they are talking about not lieutenant @-@ colonel munyakazi . let 's forget about that ; the red bus never carried lieutenant @-@ colonel munyakazi .
no this is a trial . it is being proceeded right now !
it is not a trial . he has just asked his question in his own way but this is not a trial .
that question must remove all confusions . the red pickup people saw never carried lieutenant @-@ colonel munyakazi . the second thing i did n't mention , i guess , ladies and gentlemen of gacaca court panel , is that i see people trying to bring fake accusations against me whereas i did my best to protect them .
once saint @-@ famille church was being fired at . i myself went to sainte @-@ famille church to console the population . we took sick people and they went to be treated in red cross infirmary . red cross was chaired by kayiranga in the time . i never travelled in the red car . remove that accusation completely .
that is an accusation you will deal with during the trial , sir ! of course if it is one . we have not come for trial . you should understand us ; we just want to listen to and understand your testimony as you asked it yourself .
you are asking me what you 've been told though .
of course they are asking you because they want to understand but it is not a trial . i go over to my colleague so that he may ask you as well .
court panel according to rutabana you were both in charge of distributing food in displaced people 's camp
it was not an accusation . he just wanted to know . food can not be an accusation because everyone eats .
he is saying i and the interahamwe distributed food but a lieutenant @-@ colonel who is in war can not have time to distribute food to displaced people .
court panel i want to ask a question . mister colonel munyakazi has just examples such as mille collines , sainte @-@ famille , and saint @-@ paul and he tried to help rwandans everywhere . probably he was doing that during the day . i would like to ask him there might be some journalists who saw that humanitarian action . thank you !
there was an american who was with gisimba 's displaced people in saint @-@ michel cathedral . we had taken him from nyamirambo and brought him to the cathedral . even gisimba knows that all the orphans arrived in my area thanks to the gendarme called major karangwa
you know sir ... may the court panel has not allowed me to tell you about the then structure of the army in kigali . however , i had prepared it . i hope you will allow me that . when you check well that structure and see how i did all my best to protect the people who lived in that area .....
this is not a trial . the other one confused you ; we only wanted you to spare our worries because there are things we do not know and that you might be aware of since you could go anywhere hence you have much information about what happened .
so , we want you to provide us with explanations . this is not a trial . it is neither a way we have wanted you to precede your trial . we are not even entitled with the ability to do so at all as the sector tribunal considering your personality . we give the floor to someone else
the first question concerns the political party i belonged to . according to the rwandan constitution in force till june 10th 1991 , all rwandans including you adhered to mrnd . surely it was the same for you . all people adhered to mrnd . even you because any rwandan did .
after june 10th , the constitution accepted many political parties . soldiers did not adhere to any political party . the second question you asked is about reports i drew and how many tutsis i might have warned .
i drew the reports from the 1st after the presumed accomplices started being arrested . i was told to verify . i committed myself with my entire mind and told the truth . i did my best to prevent extremists from going printing other identity cards somewhere else and say later that they had been printed at sisi evariste 's .
i also used to talk to embassy agents who came to ask us about the situation . that is why they started putting pressure on habyarimana in order to give up the plan of exterminating tutsis and start releasing people . people were released . there are even people who were released . habyarimana used to say @: "@ do not release people anymore you should check those who are being released @"@ .
in april 1991 ... it would have been bad of us if we had drawn those reports and get involved in jailing tutsis for fake accusations . i am telling you ; the report served a lot because i told foreigners that we had verified and found out that tutsis were innocent . what was the third question again ? ntirugiribambe was the territory company commander of nyarugenge . he exiled to zaire . i do not know where he might be right now . thank you !

raise your right hand and swear @: i ...
i swear to god that what i was going is true .
you shall say the truth . do not lie to us !
you have already said that this information collection . i would like to remind my brother some few things i can remember .
in 1990 , i do not remember the month and date , he co @-@ presided over a very big conference i attended at kimihurura . he was with renzaho tharcisse . they told us that any rwandan living in kigali had to return to his or her place of birth . otherwise , they had enough soldiers in all over the country and bullets so that every rwandan would be shot at .
renzaho ended saying @: "@ a word to a wise is enough ! @" this saying was a puzzle to us . we could not figure out what it meant . many of us could not know what this intended to . i beg your pardon , i want to be very brief . a long time after , you , the then gendarmerie commander , joined us somewhere in sainte @-@ famille . do you know me ? do you ?
you know sir ; i do not have anything against you . i would advise that you accepted all that has been said and that you consider as lies . we are many witnesses for that . you know that we only wanted to remind each other .
we shall give to each speaker minutes not to go beyond .
i was born in ubumanzi cell , rugenge sector , nyarugenge district . thank you .
wait a bit ! you first raise your right hand and swear @: "@ i , your name , swear to god that what i am going to say is true @"@ .
i , gasasira jean marie maurice , swear to god that what i am going to say is true .
tell the truth then !
thank you mister president1 even though we have been given few minutes , i would like to ask to be given the same minutes as him because we are all equal before gacaca .
in fact , he asked to give his testimony . we can not give you the same minutes as him considering your number . try to look behind you ; there are other people . we might even receive testimonies from five people . you can see that the testimonies can not take such a time unless you want to tell us stories from 1959 as well ! in case you want , say , to evoke something wrong he did , just go straight .
he had his own car . the red one usually rolled before his . the car bore the script commune nyarugenge ... mrnd commune nyarugenge . do n't you all know those cars in this city ? the car bore the script commune nyarugenge above which mrnd and commune nyarugenge was below . such pickups were known in this city . people who were at sainte @-@ famille may remind each other .
when he came to sainte @-@ famille he was always accompanied by interahamwe . but he had his gendarmes as he already said . it is surprising , however , that , as a commander of muhima military camp , he did not mention the name of munyeshyaka among the priests but only limited himself to celestin .
you all know what munyeshyaka did in this country . we always say his name . he is even known abroad . munyakazi usually came to munyeshyaka 's office where they held meetings together with another priest who was the army chaplain in esm .
the very munyakazi here present ... after they entered the office , all other activities stopped . we will tell you the names of the army chaplain in other cessions . mister president , i am now going to tell you the names of people who were taken from sainte @-@ famille and how they were taken .
those of our area , rugenge had also come uphill . you remember four groups that were at sainte @-@ famille i guess . renzaho , munyakazi and the school inspector were all present .
please , look at the court panel not at the audience !
thank you mister president . i just want that we may remind each other . in regard to the attack i am going to talk about , -@ i have already told you that the interahamwe had all come uphill @- it is clear that it had already been planned since they all met there ; what means they were coming to kill tutsis at sainte @-@ famille @: those from muhima , rugenge and gikondo were all present .
i would like also to tell you , mister president , people who died in sainte @-@ famille church . they are 18 @: among them was a man from gikondo who covered his head with a veil disguising himself in a woman . munyeshyaka himself ... wensislas munyeshyaka said not to put the 18 people among others . they were all taken to renzaho 's .
it was said they were going to give some information concerning inyenzi . i beg you , mister president , to go to the field so that we may prove what we are saying @: how he exercised his power and what happened under his authority . the people were tied with shirts and put into the pickup . your own pickup , mister munyakazi , was white as you said but another before yours packed those people first .
as you have just showed us the power you have on munyakazi ... we shall bring our testimonies to the tribunal . but before i leave , i would like to ask you one thing @: he has been continuously evoking rugema donatien . he came to sainte @-@ famille escaping . you all know rugema donatien was jailed among accomplices in 1990 . i have a close family relationship with him ; he is my uncle .
rugema said @: "@ among people i have just escaped from , there is munyakazi @"@ . he came crying and said @: "@ you should know that today is your last day @"@ . you all know rugema at kimihurura . his wife and children had just been killed . he arrived at sainte @-@ famille after his house had been attacked . munyakazi had always been swearing to harm him . rugema is my uncle . i will even communicate to him that munyakazi 's case is being proceeded in the tribunal .
we had tried it in 1997 . we wrote to the then military auditor general , major nzabanita joseph that there was a man in the army called laurent munyakazi we were accusing of genocide . fortunately gacaca has brought him to us . the judgment is up to you ! ask us then .
as far as i am concerned , we will continue together in proceedings because i have much to accuse him of ; from 1990 in the time of accomplices ' case . i accuse him of torturing tutsis and people who were jailed among accomplices . he here is now ! i do not want to be too long mister president . we will be together in tribunals . i am asking you two things , mister munyakazi , in very strict words @:
my names are kayitaba halufani
parents ?
karamutse juvenal
and who ?
and mukakibibi ushizimpumu
what is your cell of birth ?
i do not know that . i left there cells changed . i will tell you my residence
your cell of residence ?
thank you ! though you want me to swear , i am not giving any testimony . i am just asking
do not swear if you are asking
i want to .... mister major general munyakazi , you had told us a long story . however i think genocide took place between october 1st 1990 and december 1994 . he also told us about the invented scenario after which tutsis were arrested in order to kill them .
when you asked him you said that you want three things ; his role , what he saw and what he heard . you did not show us your role . in 1990 , at the time of the shootings i was here in kigali . i know that many people were arrested by major general munyakazi when he was still major . he said that it was an invented scenario . i want to ask him why he arrested people knowingly . how did he consider that ?
second . at nyamirambo regional stadium , many people called upon him for help because he was in a vey good position for that . among people he helped , there is one woman he released and she went home . others perished there . he told us he drew a report but i do not agree with him because if he had really drawn the report , he would have released the people from the stadium . on the contrary , he took them to jail .
come only if it is the matter of testimony . those with suggestions will have their turn after . the turn is for witnesses . those who do not have testimonies should move back ; they will have their turn and give their views .
right ! my names are nyirubuntu epaphrodite , i was born in 1970 . there is something i ...
are you going to give us a testimony ?
yes , a testimony !
eeh ! raise your hand
i , nyirubuntu epaphrodite
swear to god
swear to god that what i am going to say is true .
you did not mention your parents ' anmes !
my father 's names are bugesera wenslas , my mother 's mukabaranga astherie .
eeh ... we spent there all the day on 14th and 15th . it seemed escaping from the rain under a sweating tree . munyakazi came with renzaho . he sent interahamwe into the church . they started seating us in the very church and picking up people whom they packed in the red pickup he has often evoked . they carried them in eight rounds till they saw strong young men had almost finished . they mainly took young men
eeh ! then after ... i will be brief . minuar came . they wanted to take people who wanted to go to the area controlled by rpf . minuar started by mille collines . we were carried in about two rounds . however interahamwe could stop people at times but things ceased after on the date i do not remember well . it was probably on june 15th when minuar came . meanwhile , they gave us a conference and told us they would come to take us .
eeh ! renzaho entered . for munyakazi , sainte @-@ famille was like his home because he usually came there . they usually came there with goats and asked to have their meal in priests ' buildings . the only priest who stayed there was called wensislas munyeshyaka . he [ munyakazi ] was at sainte @-@ famille every time and every single hour . they were checking whether the number of young men was enough so that they might carry them out .
they sometimes picked some and carried them out . once they heard that minuar would come to take us . they met and said that in case young men were taken , rpf would gain much force . it would gain soldiers . it was decided that in case people would be taken , it had only to be children , old men and women
at that time , munyakazi himself , renzaho and munyeshayaka were standing there . they told a lady called angelina to go and come with her interahamwe in order to circle us . let 's see ... they were discussing about the departure of young men on 16th that was the time they also told angelina to come with her men to surround sainte @-@ famille
they [ munyakazi and others ] said that they would be bringing others during the whole night . the place was circled by the morning . munyakazi himself came and went to carry them and dropped them behind the church . about 9 , they started climbing and getting into the enclosure . they ordered to only shoot at young men and not women
we were seated and some of us were opened rapid fire at . we were seated on the floor . minuar came on 17th . it arrived . those who were not killed , we were seated on the floor . munyakazi who is defending himself entered and cried @: "@ withdraw ! withdraw ! minuar are there !
"@ get out with those you have not yet killed and kill them outside @"@ . i also stood up among them . when i reached sainte @-@ famille ’ s door to the steward 's office , while munyakazi and his colleagues were preventing minuar from getting in , i went to hide between containers which were there . those who lived there know it .
munyakazi seated us and they picked young men whom they took into the minibus that stationed next to containers outside . i do not know where it had been taken from . young men were seated in it . i stayed behind . this man owned a bar where nzeyi worked . he [ munyakazi ] even used to deliver driving licenses there some time ago in order to earn a little money .
the man called nzeyi was his employee . we could sometimes meet in nzeyi 's bar . i stayed behind and i went to tell munyakazi that we were not inyenzi but displaced people . we were about to go downhill a bit . one of the young men tried to get off the car and enter the steward general 's office garage . munyakazi and munyeshyaka followed him . and i moved back .
he carried the young men that evening . we do not know where he took them . whether he employed them or ... we do not know . he should tell us where he might have kept our young men . he carried them away ; they were 18 . he took them away himself and only him ! though he said he had no connection with interahamwe , he once entered the church with twelve interahamwe . they were not many and there was no policeman .
angelinana and munyakazi were there . the interahamwe left in the evening . because he came back to take them away , he should tell us where he put our young men . i am almos through but , like my colleague , i also worry about my personal security .

raise your right hand and swear @: i ...
i , uwitije jean paul , swear to god that what i am going to say is true
tell us the truth then
i will tell you the truth . the first thing is that this very munyakazi himself invited us .
what munyakazi told us is not a testimony at all . it is just a eulogy of his . tutsis died . people from ruhengeri killed them . what he said was not our expectation . we already know it .
what i am telling munyakazi is that he kept killing people and now people are accusing him . i am accusing him as well as someone who was at sainte @-@ famille .
i went there on 19th ... 14th . i left when the war ended . there are people who were at sainte @-@ famille but have not seen him yet well . i beg him to stare at me carefully . he himself , stood by me wile i was sitting down . i will remind him the words he pronounced then he will remember as he said he does not know anything .
munyakazi himself first came to sainte @-@ famille .... we 've been given few minutes by the way ! munyakazi came and took away one lady called chantal and about eight young men . he carried them in a pickup and he said he was taking them to mille collines . if the young men are still alive it might be just luck ; i can only see the woman today .
we came in very big number believing you sympathized with us . you separated those who wanted to go to the side of inyenzi and those who wanted to go to the government . realizing that the number of those who wanted to the inyenzi 's side was bigger , you became angry and moved your spectacles . you talked to renzaho . i do not know what you said . only you know . you even immediately left .
the following day , i think there were still few people left at mille collines . you came for evacuation . when you arrived you did not allow any man to go . when he wanted you said he was going to join inyenzi . you can see well that we know that you were present . do not try to tell a single lie . then after , you went and told the interahamwe to stop men so that only women might go .
even those who received them can say it . on june 16th the day i will n't forget , after people had been taken to saint @-@ paul and we were staying there , you came and stared at us
then you went out and came back at once with renzaho , commander gisunzu , angelina , and the then sector councilor called odette i guess . you went some where . you were with the interahamwe kimba and seseko . because you are saying that you were not there ; i am just reminding you .
you came and stood on the slope down which we were staying . then ... you munyakazi . they started picking people . among those left , there was a man called enock and others . there were still about ten people in front of amri 's house . you talked and after a while we saw the interahamwe standing all along the fence . we were outside the church . we were sitting in the sunshine . at once , we heard the interahamwe shooting at the door of the church .
women had stayed in . they ran out . meanwhile , there was a policeman with them called yoramu or something alike . he was from ruyenzi . he had arrived in the morning and told us @: "@ you know what ! today might be your last day ! inyenzi have taken others with them . what about you then ? @"
what he had predicted became true . you came with many interahamwe . every man was shot at . we survived by heaven 's will . only god saved us because no man would have survived . we stayed there till the night . i understand why you say you do not know it ; it is because it did not concern you . i was hiding in grass . there were toilets we had dug .
then i went down . i ran when gunshots worsened . somewhere down i joined men sitting down . these are the men my preceding colleague was talking about . you came and stood on the slope .
then , came another black tall young man in sports suit . his name must be ntirugiribambe samuel ; i guess . you were standing nearby . he was brought there . others were immediately shot at in the very place . you asked @: "@ why are bringing this ? @" they immediately shot at him and he ran away saying @: "@ mercy ! mercy ! @" on that you said @: "@ taste it ! why did you come here ? @"
calm down first then you will tell us . if you can n't go on , wait and calm down ! you have your time . let him . he has not finished yet . he will resume . let him calm down first .
"@ have n't they always been told to stay on the yard ? @" did n't you say it yourself ?
my names are mudenge sylivain

you shall raise your right hand if you are going to give a testimony . or tell us whether it is a point of view . is it a testimony ?
there is someone we talked to who has got information . he shall say it and then i will give my testimony about what i saw then i will end by asking two questions . i will n't bee too long actually
raise your right and swear as it is a testimony . you shall say @: i , your name ...
i , mudenge sylvain
swear to god
swear to god that what i am going to say is true
tell us then
it an information and testimony frm james
from james ?
but he is alive . he lives in ubumanzi or ubumwe cell
tell us an other name of james
i do not remember it . others may help me . but i know where he lives
tell us in brief what he told you .
arrived , he told them that he wanted to take them to that place . they both resisted . then he told them @: "@ let 's forget about for the moment @"@ . he immediately called muhima police station office . since then they were jailed . it was in the time of "@ accomplices ' imprisonment @"@ . that is all i was told . we might ask him personally when he will be present .
you were coming for final cleansing . you were accompanying them and you arrived there . i would like also to beg you to ask the minister of defense here present because they once arrived together at saint @-@ paul . he arrived , i was with robert and many other guys whose i do not remember names since i have not prepared it properly . i have just come from cyangugu unexpectedly . when i heard that he would be invited , i took the advantage because i have come twice and it did not
on 22nd , you came . i should also be asked about the 20th at saint @-@ paul in cela
which month ?
april . he used to pass there as an authority . when he had just left , father munyeshyaka , the then sainte @-@ famille parish priest , arrived in a gown together with gasasira . when he talked he was wearing a bullet @-@ proof
in case i forget i beg him to remind me because he , munyakazi , came to take some people . there were mukamurenzi and other athletes . i have forgotten many names . the reason i point at him is that he once came with robert kajuga . so , many often events overlap in fact .
without turning around the bush , i can firmly confirm that these people are genocide planners . i do n't want to take too long on that . have a nice work and thank you .
wait . we want to ask you a little bit . you told us that you arrived at cela but you have not told us how was the situation there
i may have trouble . i will tell you when i will be invited or i may even send a script to you . otherwise , you may read the book entitled african . there is full information . for the moment i want to end by asking my questions
i think even honorable kanzayire was hiding there . we went and sat down . we hid in an infirmary where priests found us . there were many people
his excellence munyakazi arrived . after he left father munyeshyaka came too . they continued to saint @-@ paul . it is too difficult for me to provide full information in fact . i am afraid i may lose control . however , i can answer some few questions if there are any . or ... you may even ask the very questions to renzaho or any other you may find belonging to his group .
ask the questions you have just evoked
my question is about ... i was praying during that time . i would like to ask him about father munyeshyaka when he arrived at saint @-@ paul after him ... many have even been saying this . they came and separated people then took some with them .
what can he tell us about munyeshyaka ? he has already said a lot and you took notes . what can he tell us about the attacks at lycee notre dame de citeaux ? i am curious because i was a student there but i did not have time to investigate due to everyday problems . can he tell us about saint @-@ michel ? can he tell us about saint @-@ paul after we left there saved and they still had sainte @-@ famille ? we want to spare our worries .
the last speaker has just asked munyakazi to say what happened at saint @-@ paul after they left there
we would like to facilitate you sir . so to go faster , we shall tell you questions to answer !
he has lastly asked about munyeshyaka . we know that munyeshyaka lives in france . probably he would like to know what you know about munyeshyaka 's role because he might have been close to you . would you give some explanations about that ? let 's start by that one .
listen sir , in order to be brief and save time you should n't tell a long story when you are asked a question .
tell us for example @: munyeshyaka did this and this or if you do n't know say you do n't
all i know of munyeshyaka is that he was in charge of those displaced people . i told you that i did not participate to those attacks people have been talking about .
that is what i told the court panel . people have also been evoking the date of june 17th 1996
the court panel had already asked me to say what i did on this date of june 17th 1996 . i told the tribunal that on this date of june 17th 1996
when rpf had taken people from saint @-@ paul , you know there was a zone belonging to rpf , interahamwe attacked all the places . i immediately went to hotel de milles collines because the interahamwe had just broken doors there
though it is being said that i was at sainte @-@ famille chasing minuar soldiers , those who were in that area were staying at hotel de mille collines . i spent the entire day with them . their commander was lieutenant @-@ colonel mwangi from congo brazzaville
i never chased minuar soldiers . neither did i see the attacks of interahamwe as i told the tribunal .
so let us ask you some questions . many questions have been asked in fact but we shall help you to go faster
there is a question by nyirangazare about the conference you co @-@ presided with renzaho tharcisse saying they had to leave kigali for their places of birth
you shall explain the reason for that in brief . did it take place or no ?
it did n't
she evoked something of sainte @-@ famille but you have been explaining that . there is one question left
what i can add , if you do allow ! i read of nyirangazare in new times and someone called gasongo was often evoked .
it is said that i took away that gasongo from kibuye on that day when he left saint @-@ paul center
concerning what gasasira said they had submitted the accusations in the army auditor 's office , at nzabanita joseph 's , i did n't know it . i was never called in order to provide explanations
a member of the commission once joined me in gisenyi . i will say his name later as you said this is not a trial . i was with officers i commanded . he told them that there were many accusations against lieutenant @-@ colonel munyakazi
however , we conducted an investigation and we found that rugema donatien and prefect kabera were wrongfully accusing lieutenant @-@ colonel munyakazi .
the person would have been here and give you explanations if he had not been abroad . if things do not improve , he told me he will come
and show you that it was found out that those accusations were fake ones brought to me whereas we are all leaders as it sometimes happens when one hates another
the person joined me there and told me that i was wrongfully accused ; that i never killed a single individual ; that those i took away
on 17th , 18th , and 19th i took them to saint @-@ michel cathedral ; that they found out that they are all alive . it was said when i was with officers ; they may come and tell you .
i never knew that investigation conducted by the army auditor 's office . that 's all i knew .
you are going too far sir . we have what we are asking you that is simpler .
saying they were to provide some information . they must be those you took away in order to save them . what would you say ?
he , as well as others , may be wondering @: who proved innocent ? where are others ? would you explain it more ?
i told you that the people i took on 17th , 18th , and 19th from sainte @-@ famille and procure
were all taken to saint @-@ michel cathedral . they are all alive . that 's what i told you .
i never carried those other people in the pickup people have been talking about red or .... not at all
they said you arrived at sainte @-@ famille . did you or not ? so that we may ask tell us first whether you entered ?
i went there even at the time of gomme falling down . every time there was a problem and i was called upon for help i went as an authority
given many people always died there -@ you might be aware of it yourself @- and that you arrived at sainte @-@ famille sir ;
i also told you i did my best to help the population
would you spare our worries about the people who died on 17th and 16th whom epa said you put their bodies in the steward 's office buildings ,
in the steward general 's office garage in order to hide them from minuar general ? would you tell us about that general ?
i did not kill them . here is the whole story @:
eeh ! tell us if you do know
as i told you , interahamwe attacked saint @-@ paul center , sainte @-@ famille church , and hotel de mille collines . i was at hotel de mille collines .
interahamwe entered sainte @-@ famille church , took people form the church and shot at them between procure and the church . as i was told by some priests .... i saw one here by the way !
he might explain it to you . ... their bodies were taken to the steward general 's office buildings . that took place yes but as i told you i did not head that attack
i was told by priests that the bodies were taken from where they had been shot at , between the church , procure and priests ' buildings
people were shot at there . there were many interahamwe ; that is true . i was at hotel de mille collines
i never headed those attacks though i have just been accused of it together with colonel renzaho , angelina and odette
i was at hotel de mille collines helping all people who were there . i think it was that time when father uwimana saw that i had just helped people
and asked me to go and help the people who were at father vermerie 's
we got it . would sit a bit ! please wait a moment . wait
i am father galican . my address is here at saint @-@ paul center . i was born in gitarama in rubona sector
cell ?
i , galican
swear to god
swear to god
that what i am going to say is true
that what i am going to say is true
we are expecting father to tell us the truth given you were there and watched the whole scenario
my mother is kamanazi charlotte
year of birth ?
i would like first to remind you that the time given for testimony is not enough to talk about what happened at sainte @-@ famille and saint @-@ paul
whereas it is the center of the problem . people have different information because they did not see what happened in the same way
we , as priests who were in charge of looking after displaced people at sainte @-@ famille and saint @-@ paul bearing in mind there were other people outside though @:
on sainte @-@ famille primary school playground , on sainte @-@ famille church yard , and other people who were displaced by fighting but were not hunted by interahamwe
those who were at sainte @-@ famille and saint @-@ paul even at cela during the first days as well as people who were escaping from interahamwe
right ! we did not distinguish people ; we did not for example consider whether one was escaping from interahamwe
we did all that for the sake of everybody 's security . that means that as priests , we held secret meetings in evenings
in order to share the information we might have collected from different people all along the day and be able to handle all these people who were displaced up there
we did not say neither this one informed us , that we wanted to inform them about a possible attack against sainte @-@ famille
there were even people who held meetings among them . there were xaverians who could come and tell us warn us about a possible attack . the information could be got that way
since we could not know those who were connected to interahamwe , we did not reveal anything .
one could reveal that information and the very informed people would go to complot . that is the way it worked
i do not even know why people have not evoked munyeshyaka . munyeshyaka did nothing wrong . he never intended to betray people .
that is why i was telling you people understand things in differently . we , as priests either in sainte @-@ famille or
saint @-@ paul ... we had appointed father celestin to take care of those displaced people at saint @-@ paul . i do n't know why people did not mention that interahamwe arrived there to remove bodies
as they came to sainte @-@ famille to take and kill people . this leads me to talking about munyakazi now
what i am telling you is a true testimony . i would also like to let you know that there are soldiers who had come to guard sainte @-@ famille and saint @-@ paul
we had resorted to minister aloys . munyeshyaka had told him that there had been attacks in the night and interahamwe were coming to kill people
he said he was going to handle the situation . i worked with munyeshyaka . then after , we saw gendarmes coming the following day .
gendarmes settled at procure main entrance because displaced people were in the church and the hind doors were closed .
once a very strong attack came to take people from sainte @-@ famille and because interahamwe entered in disorder ,
we asked the gendarmes to take guns from them at the entrance . they did it .
however as i said it earlier the gendarmes were never been able to stop very strong attacks
they were stronger than them till munyakazi himself some were stronger than him
please , listen !
i still have the floor . if we really want the truth we should be saying the reality of things
we shall ask him questions . he will explain . listen ; let him say what he knows , another person will say his . please , stop shouting
what i can add is that among the gendarmes we had been given , there were bad @-@ hearted ones who wanted the people to be killed .
it became even necessary to transfer some because they said they were protecting inyenzi while their army was being killed by some of them at the battlefield
we asked that some might be transferred . you can remember those who were on the yard , during the first days , could go to fetch water and sell some articles to people who could not go out .
after that , the interahamwe talked about who were at sainte @-@ famille set a barrier saying inyenzi were being given water .
after the barriers were set , we resorted to the gendarmes so that they might go and fetch water for us . they did it .
in the parish yuhi where i lived , i went with major nsanzimfura jean baptiste after having called him for help that that the assumption sisters risked to be killed where they had been left . i told him to rush because a genocide was reaching his place
he told me to go and take them . i first feared to go far and he ensured me that if i was to die we would both die .
so , we went together . okay ! that evening we were facilitated from gitikinyoni to sainte @-@ famille by one thing ;
inkotanyi were shooting and bombarding a lot in order to come and take people from saint @-@ paul .
we came and arrived around midnight because our tyre deflated . we had never been at ease all along the journey . at any time we could be told @:
"@ speed up ! we may get shot at @" because the car was slow .
arrived at sainte @-@ famille , i spent the night in procure with father munyeshyaka because i had forgotten the keys of the door from the steward 's office to saint @-@ paul .
then we heard a lot of bullet shots in saint @-@ paul
i remember that father munyeshyaka told a soldier called murekezi to call minadef and tell them that interahamwe were killing people left at saint @-@ paul
the soldier did then told him @: "@ inkotanyi are already there @"@ . they had just known what we thought was wrong .
i wanted to leave then and i told them that at night one can not recognize that another wears a bulletproof . what they said is true he wore a bulletproof .
the following morning -@ i had already spent the night in procure @- the intrepid people i talked about ... i mean interahamwe
would you be brief father ? there are still other people who want to talk
okay ! i just want to tell you about the following morning . it is true that colonel munyakazi arrived
in the morning
on 17th ?
no sooner had they said so than i quickly ran to hide in saint @-@ paul .
as i was saying , those people really died in the yard of priests ' buildings .
after they were killed , the bodies were thrown in the grave that was in the steward general 's office garage
i can n't say that ... i with others wo were in saint @-@ paul only heard they were being killed . we ourselves were hiding
in the afternoon , around 5 p.m. general munyakazi came to take us . he took us to the archbishop 's palace .
we went there . some time after the french bernard couchner met us there . we told him @: "@ so to verify the scandals ,
go to sainte @-@ famille and enter the garage ; you will see a heap of bodies @"@ .
it was true because we had just known that the bodies were still there .
that is what happened there but the story is longer than that . if there are questions you may ask me .
i want to ask you one question father ; the bodies thrown in the garage , have they been exhumed and worthily buried or not yet ?
after some time after the bodies went stinking and people came and went to bury them . but where they were buried ....
who took them away ?
i can not know that . we were at archbishop 's palace at that time . i do n't have information
were they taken from the graves and taken away ?
they were taken from the graves and taken away ? the graves were still stinking even after war .
have you said munyeshyaka had a bullet @-@ proof and a pistol ? was he a soldier ?
munyeshyaka first owned a kalashnikov , then
please listen
he once phoned me and told me that he had just had a gun . i went and joined him at sainte @-@ famille . i asked him whether he could dare bear a gun on his shoulders and walk . he told me that it was of course heavy .
he told me that he was going to ask for a pistol . he asked for it and he got it . i asked him whether he would shoot at person with it . he slipped on his shirt and put it here .
then i told him @: "@ what will you do with a pistol ? @" he answered @: "@ i can not dare kill .
it is just to make the interahamwe believe that i am one of them and then fear me @"@ . that is what he told me . so , i told him to slip on it but not to reveal it .
"@ it would be of no use . @"@ why would i have asked for it if i slip on it then ? it is just to make the interahamwe fear me , see me and find in me a partner @" he said .
are you allowed that at least ?
munyakazi arrived there in the morning . what did you talk with him ? what did he come for ?
i did not talk to him
what did he come for ?
i do not even know that . i just got out of procure -@ i spent my night there @- and i found him there . then after he left . i would be lying if i gave further explanations
you might go to your place ! we want the lady who wants to for work . do not worry . your turn is coming soon . you can also see that she is old . introduce yourself first .
thank you . my names are agnes mukandutiye
parents ?
vincent bujegenya and gashongore marianne . i was born in rutonde
i am going to give a testimony just for some minutes
raise your right hand and swear @: i , your name ...
i , agnes mukandutiye
swear to god
swear to god
that what i am going to say is true
that all i am going to say is true
tell us now
they immediately went in the church together with interahamwe . i do not know their names because i was from cyahafi sector .
angelina saw me and exclaimed @: "@ tutsis , you are as hardy as weed . are you still alive mukandutiye ? @" she was an acquaintance of mine actually .
next she told me to join others . they were 18 young men and i was the nineteenth .
in my testimony i want to thank this man munyakazi because he saved me . how would have saved me if he had not arrived then ?
i went out with the young men . when we reached the red car i was talking about , munyakazi told angelina @: "@ i do n't know anything wrong with this woman ! @"
angelina replied @: "@ we have been sent by renzaho . why do n't you come with us and go to tell him that the woman is innocent ? @"
what munyakazi did immediately ; he told me @: "@ go back @"@ . i really thank you sir . however , we would like to know where the young men disappeared .
let 's receive that one . what are your names ?
eeh ! ...
raise your right hand and swear @: i ...
i , ntaganzwa evariste
swear to god
swear to god
that what i am going to say is true
that what i am going to say is true
tell us now !
he carried in the car bidede and others . that is the day when people were killed at rugenge sector 's office . you remember their number .
for the first round , he carried bidede and others . what about the second and the third ?
the first round i am talking about there were bideli and other young men from kacyiru whose names i do not remember . there were also other guys from nyanza
there were also murashi 's children from numuhungu 's place and a one @-@ handed small boy called rukinirwa . actually those bodies which were lying there from the tarmacked road down to rugenge . all those bodies ! for sure bidede was among them .
i am talking about bidede because he was the first to be caught , then shot , and finally burnt with oil
from there , they went downhill killing people up to the farm in rugenge sector .
when the car reached , people on board included @: ngamije ,
ndamage , bikomagu who was nyirabagenzi 's brother i guess .
they told me to join others and go to cleanse . i told them that i did not understand that language . i sat down again . i was holding a bible .
they went up cleansing as they said . they went to saint @-@ paul . the first person who approached me is mazimpaka who asked me about murashi 's son ...
he told me that in case i found one of his family members i would tell him about his death . of course if would be still alive myself !
no sooner had he said it than ngamije and ndagijimana asked me whether i knew him . i said that i did , that his name was mazimpaka . they ordered me @: @" go this way ! follow him @"
then i told them @: "@ yes i will @"@ . when i wanted to stop they pushed me and i fell on the other side of the road . i sat there .
they started their task . what i want to say is that though munyakazi is denying the red car , it went for the first round , went back to carry others . it went three times .
for the third round he brought those young men . they were sixteen . they were killed in cnd down rugenge sector 's office .
there was mutarambirwa 's son who jumped over the fence of the house over there and went downhill through those houses . this is written in the cell gacaca court record .
another part @: those who were hiding in sainte @-@ famille church . i think he might clarify those things and how he does not know the car ... actually i once saw him in the white car
that he acknowledges . he came to the barrier to see someone . i do know the man who was with him . he immediately met one cell leader from rugenge ; narcisse .
they went together some steps to nyanza . i was watching . after some minutes they were back and held a small a meeting . they left nyirabagenzi there who ordered not to tear tutsis ' steel sheets anymore but collect them and later be used to build houses to live in ,
and to grant to the poor survivors some of the steel sheets .
the following morning , mukeshimana 's father came to destroy steel sheets of nzabonitegeka gaston 's houses . when he started , i reminded him that the sector councilor had ordered them not to destroy steel sheets .
i asked him @: "@ why are you destroying them ? what will you build your own houses with ? @" on that , he ordered jonas ' son to come and teach me a lesson and go back to carry wood .
please evariste ; tell us about the role of this man first . we shall follow up that after
his role is that though he is denying the car , everything was done under his command . jonas ' son beat me here !
nurses there could not treat me . then they told me to go out very quickly because something bad was to take place in a short time .
when i went down to sainte @-@ famille the interahamwe there took me and made me sit down there all the day . munyakazi should not deny because he used the two cars .
no one should not go beyond three minutes . be brief . as a group you should write and give us a written testimony .
you shall bring the testimony to the tribunal if there are other issues in relation to aiding and abetting .
wait a moment
raise your right hand and swear @: i , your name
i , uwanyirigira mathilde
swear to god
that what i am going is true
tell us
people have been talking about sainte @-@ famille and saint @-@ paul . i was at nyamirambo in saint @-@ andre . i want to talk about what happened there .
because the gentleman might have no time to go there due to daily activities .
it was on the 6th . it was known that there were babies from nyacyonga .
when we were attacked , priests who were there said that they had babies who deserved no death at all
then , we asked the priests @: "@ as you have babies , take also ours , go and put them may be in red @-@ cross or hotel de mille collines ... wherever provided they are survive . please help us .
we knew that we had absolutely to die .
anytime we heard soldiers we would immediately went under beds , in rooms , everywhere ! he came and took all of us from there . he used a french word @: "@ c' est impossible ! we thought here were only babies . get out . all of you @"@ .
we went out . we went closer and greeted him . he did not harm us at all . we told him @: "@ we know you are a high @-@ ranked soldier here in kigali .
and we have babies . we are not asking you to save us . we know you can go nowhere with us . pleases save at least our babies ! @"
he told us that he would handle the problem @: @"@ on va voir ! @" it was on 8th . on 9th we spent the day there . on 10th , people among them munyakazi , came shooting into windows .
they shot tear @-@ gas into us in such a way that some babies died . there were many women and babies . we were then packed like cassavas or beans into a daihatsu pickup .
once on the pickup , i realized that my eldest child who was five was not there . i insisted to go down and take my child .
i went down and looked for my child . once i found , we came together . when i arrived i found that people on board were being beaten with guns .
i remember that there was an interahamwe who moved off a priest 's motorbike . general munyakazi shot at its tyres and said @: "@ have you come to take off priests ' property ? @"
he showed me where to stand if i was hutu . when they were distracted , i went back into the house . they carried those people away and none of them was seen back .
general was there . that is what i had to say . thank you .
may you come back so that we may ask you ? do you remember the number of the people taken away ?
they were about 300 . their names are too many that ...
who do you remember ?
ladies such as donathile ; immacule , vianney 's wife , there were very many . i knew all of them ....
introduce yourself first
my name is nyirinkwaya ......
raise your right hand and swear @: i ...
i nyirinkwaya geoffrey ,
swear to god
swear to god
that what i am going to say is true
that what i am going to say is true
tell us
i will n't say a lot . i will talk about some places evoked by people before me @:
because it was a place where they thought they could be safe . we arrived and spent four days there . i do n't know the dates . you may ask munyakazican because he participated in attacks and entered there .
we spent about four days . on the second day , young men who were there , we thought of establishing self @-@ defense system against interahamwe
so that they might not easily invade . the formed self @-@ defense group was made of albert , the chief ,
gihana , makombe , and others whose i do not remember names .
the group was so strong that we beat the first interahamwe 's attack . at the second time beat them as well .
we were no longer afraid . we hanged on the entrance wall and the following one the timetable for watching in turns to ensure everybody 's security .
after being severely defeated , the interahamwe went to resort to a higher security level . you know well it was headed by the very munyakazi who even headed the following attack . this shows he had been called upon by them .
when they came , they were with this man , renzaho tharcisse , angelina and many others i do not remember well . people who are here know and remember them .
we went and approached our chief aside and let munyakazi , renzaho and others get in . they passed through between cela buildings . you can see the corridor yourself
they went past the first house , reached the second which was seemingly a chapel , where some were hiding .
others were in a guava garden . they told all people to come to the upper side . munyakazi himself gave the order of closing the upper path . they started cutting down the bush on the upper side in order to see who might be hiding there .
we gathered . everyone was taken from the hideaway . renzaho said @: "@ there are now only tutsis . shoot at them @"@ .
this one said to wait lest there should be hutus among them . i ask him to remember ; he said that instead of being killed together they should be killed according to their residence places .
"@ muhima here , kimicanga , upper kiyovu , lower kiyovu @"@ , he himself pronounced those words . he said that people should be killed . he used those words .
all people gathered according to their regions or sectors of origin . i , my two elder brothers , my cousin and few other people did not have any group to belong to .
renzaho asked @: "@ where do these belong to ? @" we answered @: "@ we are visitors from kibungo . we do not have reason to enter any of the groups . integrate us wherever you like . you may kill or save us @"
the mother went down to call her husband where he was hiding behind a cupboard . no sooner had they arrived than this one and his men took them and killed the whole family there .
that one started killing people like that at everyone 's sight with a cruel torture in cela
someone called .... has been asked and did not dare say it but this man in front of you headed the attack at cela .
for the sake of reliable information collection , in case he feels i am not telling the truth , i would beg him to come and say for example : @"@ this and this is not true or i did not arrive there @"@ ...
he was fully there ! he watched the death of people , he gave suggestions holding pistol when the interahamwe were doing their best to exterminate people , tutsis .
just after degode , wilson , gihana , vincent who was a judge were killed ,
this very man ordered that the people gathered in sectors and cells be taken away to be killed .
munyakazi himself , as you see him in front of you , wore his trousers far below the waist , very proudly , believing himself to be the almighty
and my cousin they worked together thought that because renzaho was from kibungo , he would save them . so they went to him .
they went to that side . i and my elder brother stayed with this man . there was also another called antoinet . they told us @: "@ join those interahamwe @"@ .
that was actually a way of delivering us to them . fortunately , we went through the entrance of cela , we went and arrived among displaced people at sainte @-@ famille .
when we joined those displaced people who were in sainte @-@ famille , they all moved away from me because i was easily remarkable . i mean ... among the wanted .
both tutsis and hutus left me alone on the yard so that i might be caught .
i thought that instead of betraying others i should stay and be taken from there .
it was about 10 or 11 a.m. people were being taken away one after one , slowly by slowly . i was still with my brother .
the following day , i was the only one to survive among the security group . others were killed in my eyes like yours who did such a work .
they called @: "@ nyirinkwaya @"@ ... first they called albert @: "@ is albert around ? @" he was n't . "@ gihana ? @" he was n't . then they called my name
i thought @: @"@ this is my end now . let me just go @"@ . i put off my coat and my watch ; i gave them to my elder brother so to keep them and i decided to go .
luckily one of the interahamwe , faustin , said @: "@ we have absolutely killed all these inyenzi ! @" they called another who came after me on the list . his name was makombe . he is also here right now , he can give you his testimony
he was the fourth to be called and i was the third . because they had just thought we all died , we survived that way .
this man munyakazi , himself , headed the attacks at cela . he is responsible for the death of those people . absolutely ! i saw these things with my own eyes . i even have more .
there are men namely rutabana who said that he killed people at sainte @-@ famille . yes , he [ munyakazi ] once came and found me sitting where i used to sit -@ people moved any time i would sit near them @-
i was sitting like this . he held the coat i was wearing like this , and told me to go out . all people murmured @: "@ the guy is finished now ! absolutely ! @"
at that time i decided to go to cook porridge where the interahamwe often passed so to be caught from a public place instead of betraying others .
we want you to be brief
raise your right hand and swear @: i , your name
i , munyankore martin
swear to god
swear to god
that what i am going to say is true
that what i am going to say is true
tell us
she came to me and asked @: "@ why have n't you joined others to bury our enemy ? @"@ i answered her @: "@ he is not my enemy @"
she asked again @: "@ do you mean you will n't come ? @" i answered @: "@ definitely ; i will n't @"@ . she told the cell leader @: "@ i do n't want to see this man when i am back @"@ . i got arrested . there was a soldier who was a friend of mine . he took me back when we arrived at six @-@ heures
after taking me back ,
please martin , we would like to go straight to .....
i am almost on it . i will n't be too long actually . so the matter was closed .
martin in 1994 after the death of habyarimana the killings started . i had a son , kagame who was already murdered .
we went to sainte @-@ famille . munyakazi and minuar were there . they said @: "@ because people have come to join inyenzi , let 's make a list of those who are joining the government 's side and those on the inyenzi 's @"@ .
they told us to write our names and the side we wanted to go to . some refused . i told my colleagues that it probably intended to abduct us .
during the two days i had been abducted twice and people with me had paid for my ransom .
one gendarme once took me and told me @: "@ for this time , come @"@ . i asked him @: @"@ where are you taking me brother ? @" he replied @: "@ you already know where you are usually taken @"@ . i thought that was actually my end .
people gave money . some of them are even here . on that day , the lists arrived back from minuar . munyakazi had been with the father all the day
talking . they said that people should be observed and put into their categories ; tall ones ... the young priest father munyeshyaka -@ i do n't master his names ! sometimes i am likely to ....
okay ! then father munyeshyaka with this man said @: "@ follow this order ; separate tall people from others @"@ .
on that day , they had been holding a meeting all the day . father munyeshyaka came wearing a bullet @-@ proof holding a pistol . when he was celebrating the mass and moved like this the pistol fell down .
when it fell down we wondered @: "@ who is this guy reading the word of god with a gun that that has started falling down ! will n't he shoot at us in the church ? @"
i had been there for few days . i had failed to arrive before . finally minuar said that the lists had to be drawn again and that selection would take place at the football playground
arrived outside .... by the way ; i had five children , mine and my sister 's , who had just died . i was with this man and the other lady .... odette .
they said @: "@ make sure munyentwali does not escape . can you imagine someone who called his son kagame ? can you imagine that ? he even refused to go to rwigema 's burial saying he was not an enemy . by the way , you , sector councilor , why have kept such a person till today ? @"
it was on the playground . i was about to get on the truck . this man and munyeshyaka refused absolutely . it became a great dispute . finally , minuar took me away by force .
those who stayed at sainte @-@ famille were killed after we left . i was at kabuga . that was my testimony .
we were together for thirty minutes during the dispute with minuar when i was getting on board . how can he be denying all these things ?
he was preventing you from getting on board ?
he and munyeshyaka . they said that i had to stay because i was not on the list . they checked the list and found out that i had a different name . i had my identity card with me . they refused saying that i should wait for my turn and i could be alive till that time .
i had already been abducted for five times . people paid for my ransom . i was only abducted by gendarmes . no interahamwe did .
you can go
say your name first !
i , nkusi antoine swear to god that what i am going to say is true .
what i am going to say about munyakazi is true .
on the 7th we escaped to ..... we spent many days there . i will n't say much of him .
my colleague already said it and we were together
we were even in the same group
but we were dispersed by this man and his men .
and nyirabagenzi . they were always together .
we were hiding and had been gathered together , this man observed
and realized that people of his ethnic group would also die with us in case we were all killed .
he said @: "@ put them in groups according to their cells of origin @"@ . it was done as such .
some were packed into the car . among those rwanga and his children .
he is responsible for all of that because he did it there . after some time we left the place
covering our heads with mattresses . some went to sainte @-@ famille .
fortunately we arrived at sainte @-@ famille . he was always there .
to show us their bodies so to worthily bury them . that 's it .
thank you ! my name is safari , rugenge sector ,
nyarugenge district , kigali city . what i have realized about this man , munyakazi ....
i , safari hamoud , swear to god that what i am going to say is true
what i have realized about this man , munyakazi is that he is contradicting himself
as far as 1990 and 2005 are concerned .
one might say he is adjusting his position to vision 2020 !
though he has been denying the red car , he actually traveled in it in 1994 .
he looked out of the window and told them @: "@ what is wrong ? there is no shit here ! @"
the interahamwe answered him @: "@ we have no tools @"
he replied @: "@ how come that you do n't ? @" he looked out of the window again and talked to the gendarmes in the boot .
he told them @: "@ provide them with tools @"@ . they immediately gave them grenades . i wonder how the shit had to be removed with grenades !
was that a wheelbarrow to remove the shit ?
after being supplied by him , they entered my aunt 's house where i was staying .
they met me the first . they told me to stand on my knees . they told me @: " say your last pray because you are going to die ! @"
i stood on my knees and say my prayer in arabic . they said @: "@ this one is talking to kagame in their language @"@ .
i did not know our father and i mixed it with hail mary .
another called david , beat me with a machete in my back .
the interahamwe called maroc saw me and remembered that we used to play together at kimihurura .
he said @: @"@ this boy is not an inyenzi . we used to play together at kimihurura .
i never saw him involved in such things @"@ .
he held the grenade given to him by munyakazi . he told them @: "@ if you kill him , i send you to hell with this grenade . i swear ! @"
they were frightened and left me . i do n't understand why munyakazi is standing here
and denies that he travelled in the red car , that he supplied the interahamwe
i was born in 1949
cell of birth ?
muyange cell . i am going to give you my testimony
raise your right hand and swear
i , mukangarambe domithile , swear to god that what i am going to say is true
the testimony i want to give to you is that this man munyakazi ... first he held a meeting . he was with odette .
in the meeting , they told people to destroy tutsis ' houses so that their sons might have steel sheets to cover their houses .
after the meeting people came downhill . there was an old man of my neighborhood called charles kabendegeri who
he pointed at me and said @: "@ it is as if traitors who are here have not heard what the gendarmerie commander has told us @:
that we must get rid of these traitors @"@ . something else i want to say about munyakazi concerns the people he is denying .
i mean one hundred eighty @-@ six of sainte @-@ famille
they were put on minitrap 's truck .
they drove them down to kiyovu .
munyakazi was in a red car though he is denying it .
he came with a driver from the gendarmerie called murindwa
who was my neighbor . he arrived asking whether there were not tutsi shit .
they turned back the truck . the car of this one followed it . he was asking @: "@ is n't there any shit here ? @"
others could reply @: "@ when we kill , we immediately bury ! we do not need help ! @"
who said that "@ when we kill , we immediately bury . we do not need help ! @"@ ?
the interahamwe who were there . murindwa also said it .
he told them to get on the truck and he followed them . only he knows where he carried them .
i saw him again when the gendarmerie headquarters was captured by inkotanyi . he came to see murindwa and told him to go and carry soldiers
having lost their legs . those who were dead were carried to gisenyi to be buried .
i saw him again coming to murindwa 's house . he said @: "@ i think the inyenzi are beating us now ! @"
i can n't imagine why he is defending himself whereas he used to come to people 's homes to hold meetings .
i did not even know that his name was munyakazi .
he used to come with nyirabagenzi and others to hold meetings .
i can n't imagine why he says he was not involved in killings
whereas he is the one to have sensitized people about the presence of inyenzi !
that is what i had to talk about him according to what i saw .
let 's start by gisimba damas
my names are mutezintare gisimba damas son of gisimba and mukamanzi dancile
be brief . you only have three minutes
briefly , i met him during the war .
i was at nyamirambo , in my orphanage
there were many displaced children because there had been an orphanage for a long time .
many children having lost their parents escaped there . there are even those who were killed there .
the war was very cruel ; the interahamwe often attacked us but failed to harm us .
try to be quick , mister gisimba
something important i did is that i hid people
the operation to displace people was carried out by major karangwa
he and about four gendarmes took us from nyamirambo .
we went to saint @-@ michel . once munyakazi came there .
he came , observed and did not say a thing .
we were hosted by father karibushi , the then parish priest .
he had first hesitated and i told him @: "@ these are displaced people of mine . remember the vow you made to god !
all people are your sheep . these are mine i put within your hands .
they are yours as well @"@ . i did not see him anymore . soldiers abruptly got in .
i resisted because i could see that they wanted to trick me in order to kill them .
i could n't see in lycee notre dame anything that would separate me from the children .
i went on tricking them till they were all confused and gave up .
during those days we arrived , interahamwe killed none of mine or displaced people .
no one was killed by interahamwe at saint @-@ michel
do you mean that no one died at saint @-@ michel ?
no one died when i was there . we stayed there for very few days ,
then inkotanyi found us there on 4th and many soldiers were escaping on the 3rd .
i found rpf soldiers who wore differently .
they saw me , called me and asked me who i am . i told them . they told me to go back
that 's fine . we only wanted to know whether people did not die there or ...
do you have any other information to give us ?
no people died there !
introduce yourself
my names are gatete francois . i was born in kibuye . i am the son of gashonga and mukabashinga fayini .
i , gatete francois , swear to god
i will talk about what happened in1990 because i do n't know much about 1994
i want to talk about the former prefect of kibuye , donatien
who , he is telling us , was among the officers he commanded in ruhengeri .
he is saying that he got the information that kabera assiel and mp donatien ruhima
were wrongfully accusing him . i am talking as someone who fully knows him @:
major general sitting here behind .
those two men were misfortunate and beaten
at nyamirambo stadium . he wanted to evoke them because of what he did to them .
assiel i have just evoked died of wounds . he had been shot at there at nyamirambo .
he was cruelly tortured . maybe someone will talk about it .
he and others with him only took porridge . once , this man and his group of
interahamwe and gendarmes prohibited that they be given the porridge anymore .
they could put off their shoes and take the porridge with them .
i ensure you , ladies and gentlemen of gacaca court panel ,
that only assiel himself would tell the munyakazi 's deeds if he was alive .
fortunately for him he died . assiel 's death shocked me . he pitifully died .
because it was a pitiful one . we people from kibuye , have not understood it yet .
there are different rumors outside there . fortunately we 've just had one to ask .
kabera assiel died with rotten feet because of major general munyakazi !
donatie was his brother .
i would like to let him know that kabera assiel 's father and donatien 's
parents are our family members . so , saying that people from kibuye .....
i would like to ask gacaca courts to study the case of 1990's survivors
who were here at nyamirambo , who were beaten and tortured .
i may only tell you that we have failed to understand kabera assiel 's death .
but now that we know he had been told that there was someone secretly hunting him ,
that he [ munyakazi ] jailed donatien till he was shot at without having given such a testimony at least ,
that we did not know how he was shot to death , major general shall have to pay that . we will go to all tribunals to accuse him of that !
my names are rwanyange robert , my father is rwanyange aloys and my mother marie .
i , rwanyange robert , swear to god that what i am going to say is true .
people have been talking about the colonel 's actions . we were at lycee notre dame de citeaux .
the place has been evoked many times and was one of places he had to control .
we went to ... on april 30th 1994 ,
those who were lucky to survive , we went to hide in a small forest that was there .
around 10 or 11 , munyakazi with gendarmes came to lycee notre dame de citeaux .
they called people and some including me kept hiding .
some women were discovered where they were hiding because it was very near .
after some time , munyakazi could even call @: "@ show yourselves ! show yourselves !
i am lieutenant @-@ colonel @"@ . we had not even recognized him before .
those who thought we would get killed if we showed ourselves , we stayed there .
he knew that people were killed and told us @: "@ do not worry , your people are safe @"@ .
they had been taken through one path that goes down from lycee in order to be killed somewhere else .
they told him @: "@ we know they died @"@ . he replied @: "@ do not worry ! nothing bad happened to them ! @"@ .
i knew that they were dead . so , i would like to ask him to tell us about their death .
that is all of my testimony .
what are your names again ? how old were you ?
a list of people who died at lycee is available .
i wonder if i could have it . they were about 18 when getting registered .
what is his name ?
abel
what about friends ?
mwumvaneza , kagorora andre , a lady called grace and many others .
there was rugaba as well .
many people were taken from there . i would like to learn about our people 's death in lycee
my names are jean bosco . i was born in former gishoma commune
tell us your parents ' names first .
june at saint @-@ paul . when inkotanyi came to take people over there i was unlucky to stay there with other few people .
we stayed there with someone whose deeds should be highly exalted !
his name was leonard . he was a watchman at saint @-@ paul . i remember that , once interahamwe attacked saying they wanted people who stayed there ,
leonard put me into a hole . he told me that he thought i would be killed by this one .
i was saved by him . he was a watchman . many people know him .
leonard could tell me everything because i could not go out .
on 20th , it was said that gendarmes who guarded saint @-@ paul would no longer stay .
they would be transferred . by the way , i stayed because someone
he was with ... you have heard of him .
he had told me not to move because an order had been given ; to kill people who shifted from saint @-@ paul to sainte @-@ famille .
i stayed there that night . interahamwe kept coming to rob in saint @-@ paul
because people had left rushing and lost their stuffs there .
i was there every single night they came for robbery .
once i went asleep
and around 4 a.m. bullet shots awakened me ;
people of sainte @-@ famille were being killed .
i could only see him in a car . i had never come close to him .
on 20th , when we were ordered by interahamwe to go to sainte @-@ famille ,
munyakazi joined the interahamwe who stationed on saint @-@ paul yard .
there was a barrier set by the interahamwe near a kiosk that was there .
they wanted to kill me there . i felt some courage and thought to beg this man 's help ;
i said @: "@ i am innocent . you should rather be fighting inyenzi who are at kicukiro and elsewhere
but not be killing hutus , your blood , at sainte @-@ famille ! @" he said @: "@ watch out guys ! this one was in the car . he never got off ! @"
he asked me @: "@ hey you , are you hutu ? @" i answered @: "@ yes i am hutu @"@ . he asked again @: "@ where do you come from ? @"
"@ i am from kimbogo ; bucyana and bigoli were from our village @"@ .
the two communes , gishoma and kimbogo were very close to each other
i said the two men were my uncles . this man ordered to release me .
the interahamwe accompanied me to sainte @-@ famille .
i thought @: "@ if i reveal my names and origin , i will get killed @"@ .
what i thought was actually true . i went to sainte @-@ famille and took the name of ntezirya .
republican guards could sometimes come there and say that they were sent by their chief . i never knew who it was .
i saw the republican guards coming to sainte @-@ famille but i never knew what they were coming for ;
and saved us . that is what i can remember about munyakazi
lycee notre dame de citeaux @: on april 30th 1994 , the day this man has just evoked .
it is true that extremist soldiers who were in staff headquarters went to lycee notre dame de citeaux
because they were supposed to control the area . a battalion was appointed to control the area . what he said , that nuns called father karibushi on phone is true as well ;
they told him what was taking place . karibushi called me because i controlled the area of saint @-@ paul cathedral .
you should also tell us who participated in those attacks and killed people , sir !
i told you they were soldiers from staff headquarters as well as the interahamwe . they went to take people who were here on april 30th ,
1994
those nuns were actually attacked by soldiers as i said it . i left muhima
to lycee notre dame de citeaux . on that day , i met the nuns and i gave gendarmes to them
i ordered captain ... to appoint gendarmes to protect lycee notre dame de citeaux .
i was just asked where those soldiers and interahamwe took them . i do n't know .
they called me for help and i helped them . i guess there is nothing bad in it .
as far as the attack at cela is concerned , i think it took place on 7th as it has been said ... or ?
he just said that he arrived at cela on april 7th .
what about the attack of april 22nd ?
people who were at cela moved to saint @-@ paul center and we protected them there .
do you agree that there are those who survived at cela and moved to saint @-@ paul where you protected them ?
yes i do agree that there were people who escaped from cela by jumping over walls . however , i did not head that interahamwe 's attack . that is all i can add .
what do i think about the red car all people have been insisting on ?
i think i even started with it , saying that i never travelled in that car !
i never travelled in that car at all as people are saying .
i absolutely reject that i travelled in that red car . never !
maybe there was someone who travelled in it saying his name was colonel munyakazi !
during genocide it was used by others but
you had yours somewhere not far !
the car never got to ... i never travelled near it .
never ! concerning the groups that killed people in kigali ;
they were many . there were interahamwe as we 've been saying . the last one has just evoked republican guards who used to come where he was .
there were even many intelligence agents employed by other authorities .
so munyakazi should not be responsible for all those crimes !
you should ask those groups of killers but not bring all those accusations against the lieutenant @-@ colonel !
had the groups entered saint @-@ michel cathedral , i would tell you their names .
but the other area was controlled by nyarugenge territory company as i have already told the court . the groups were mrnd , cdr under the staff command
who abducted people ? those groups of killers must be responsible for it . i , lieutenant @-@ colonel munyakazi , was not commanding those groups .
the accusations about what happened at saint @-@ andre brought against me are all wrong as well .
the accusations are wrong ones . i never arrived there . i only arrived at father 's house . i was with major ngirabatware .
after the killing of eight brothers , father blanchal called ngirabatware asking him that we might go to carry brothers who were with him .
we first went to saint @-@ michel cathedral . we then went to carry them . we brought the first group to saint @-@ michel cathedral .
you may ask father blanchal and those brothers .
i never headed any attack against saint @-@ michel or his parish
please sir , remember your duty was to protect the population and i can realize that you mainly concentrated your efforts on priests and brothers .
why did you forget other people who were being killed because of their ethnic group ?
we actually saved many people . the only problem is that even someone i carried in my car denies it when he arrives here !
however , all those priests were closely connected to ... as far as shooting at archbishop 's palace is concerned .
i am telling you that all priests who were in kigali are alive . all priests and brothers who were in the area of plateau are alive
no one died and all were saved by lieutenant @-@ colonel munyakazi but once you save man and he comes here to accuse you as i have just seen it here .
please sir , you have seen yourself people who have been here to say something . they have not been appointed by the court . we do not even now them .
in addition , you asked to come and give the testimony on your own initiative and the administration only convened people
we have come just as court agents to listen to your testimony . our questions are based on what people have said .
we want to ensure you about that .
there are a lot of things about the meetings you held in rugenge . so , ...
the meetings , going outside and say there was no shit , supplying killers ... can you imagine as an authority having gendarmes under your command ! ...
concerning destroying houses in kigali , i think you can see it yourself that areas controlled by gendarmes were safe . saint @-@ michel cathedral was not destroyed ,
sainte @-@ famille was not , saint @-@ paul was not
hotel mille collines was not as well . saying i sensitized about destroying houses is just a lie .
those of saint @-@ paul , sainte @-@ famille ... you know it yourself and all people do . why did you deploy your men there ?
was it to protect houses after having failed to protect people ? i would like you to explain it to us .
the group under my command protected people at saint @-@ michel cathedral . you should ask me to explain what happened there if any problem arose at saint @-@ paul cathedral or sainte @-@ famille church controlled by gendarmes as i told you .
nyarugenge territory company , kigali formation and interahamwe attacked the institutions .
someone also o evoked kabera 's death . i did never participate in his killing .
i did not evoke him before because on march 1st 1995 ,
he and others were at saint @-@ paul ... at lycee ... saint @-@ paul center ... sainte @-@ famille church ... with mp rugema . it was in that time people say i took 13 people and carried them in a pickup . they even published it ; i read it . people from kibuye even established a commission
which had to investigate about those men 's rumors . i already explained it . but i tell you that i am not among people who shot at kabera .
thank you mister president , thank you all gacaca court panel members . i have asked to speak as one of the people who were at cela . i arrived there on 7th .
my names are kanzayire bernadette . i am not giving a testimony . i want to have some explanations from our brother general munyakazi .
as it was said , i was at cela . on 22nd , the place was attacked and all people escaped to sainte @-@ famille
and saint @-@ paul . i lived in all those places . munyakazi said that he was in charge of the mobile group .
he also said gave some orders to gendarmes who were at sainte @-@ famille , saint @-@ paul and elsewhere .
he said that he gave orders to territory company men because their commander could not be there . e member of audience this means that those men were just executing orders . i think that general munyakazi should be responsible for everything they might have done since he had taken the responsibility to gave orders to them .
furthermore , in his testimony he did not say anything about the areas of rugenge and muhima .
he only talked about saint @-@ michel and hotel de mille collines . i have wondered why he has avoided talking about sainte @-@ famille , saint @-@ paul and cela .
from caritas ' stores . however , why did n't he help him when saint @-@ paul was attacked ?
he should have helped the only priest we could find because others were hiding .
he would have helped us more like that . i would also like to ask him to tell us what he did when he went to saint @-@ paul @: to get food or whatever ...
what he went there for ? did n't he get any information from gendarmes who were there about people who had been killed there ?
he was called for help but i heard that he arrived after people were already killed .
in 1994 , young men were taken from rooms where they had escaped .
the young men were about 60 . they were killed near the place . lieutenant @-@ colonel knows it but he did not tell the court .
how did he consider that , as someone who had given orders to gendarmes ? mister president , ladies and gentlemen of gacaca panel ,
what did he do mister president ? thank you !
remember that this is not a party so that we rejoice and clap our hands ! we only thank one for his good deeds .
many people died at saint @-@ paul and i think you already know that
remember you were an authority ; you had men , equipment and weapons to stop killers , who by the way , were not as trained as your men
as far as preventing such catastrophes and lay people having been accidently armed ! you should also tell us about arming the population by the way !
there were many unities . i am going to pass through them as follows @: rwandan army staff with generals here and then ;
gendarmerie staff which was in kigali city ; kigali operation command ;
there were also .... a lot of ... as far as helping those people is concerned ,
sorry to interrupt sir ! the question was about saint @-@ paul attacks
and sainte @-@ famille . among your responsibilities as an authority , you had the ability to stop the attacks and save lives of civilians
who had escaped there because of their ethnic groups . we want you to tackle that issue .
i am almost on it . there were twelve gendarmes at saint @-@ paul and twelve at sainte @-@ famille .
there is one who said that people were abducted from saint @-@ paul in the eyes of gendarmes . what were they doing then ?
i told you that the .... entered to abduct people .
i think that the abductors of people from saint @-@ paul and sainte @-@ famille should be asked questions on their own because i was never told that such @-@ and @-@ such went to abduct people .
i would know it if they did it at saint @-@ michel . you have realized that the areas i controlled never experienced such problems .
and sainte @-@ famille to see our gendarme who had died during an attack
at saint @-@ paul . i also told you that i went to saint @-@ paul center after ... i was at hotel de mille collines .
what about those who were at sopetrad , former sopecy i think ?
there were battalion 61 gendarmes at sopecya .
no gendarmes with villagers there ?
i mean those who were with villagers on the barrier at sopetrad .
no , there were no gendarmes there from sopetrad to poids lourd road .
this was guarded by battalion 61 .
we have wished to have the long report so that we may learn more about this matter .
we do not want to this to be too long and boring . he wants to say something before we close this cession . can he ?
but he should be very brief .
i started by introducing myself . i entered esm in 1973 .
when those events broke out , i was lieutenant . the genocide of tutsis started in 1959 .
the genocide of tutsis was planned and implemented by the government of rwanda ,
the governments of rwanda till 4th 1994 @:
from 1 st 1990 till 31 st 1994 .
i was a state employee .
though i was not involved in genocide or any other crimes , i , major general munyakazi , do apologize
for having been employed by the criminal government and governments that killed more than one million people in 1994 and that now i am being accused of those crimes .
in february 1995 , in front of you all ,
i decided to separate from the criminal government that had exiled to zaire
and still planned to invade rwanda in order to resume the genocide of tutsis .
on march 1st 1995 ,
considering what i said on radio rwanda , some thought that i was for the interahamwe 's side .
national gendarmerie and all those services i was reported to investigated and found out that some accusations were faked .
i thank the government of rwanda , the government of national unity
that reintegrated me into rpa and appointed me brigadier commander in ruhengeri and gisenyi . in gisenyi , together with other soldiers , i fought against ex @-@ far and interahamwe
who were planning to resume genocide in rwanda .
rpa beat the interahamwe and ex @-@ far soldiers once again in such a way that they returned to congo and we shall always win !
since november 2002 , i am the second division commander in byumba ,
kibungo , and umutara . together with other rdf soldiers we maintain the population 's security .
i also thank the government of national unity that appointed me rwanda 's representative
for having ranked me colonel , brigadier general ,
major general , what i had never thought of in my life .
panel member please sir , would you say it in the report ?
panel member ladies and gentlemen governmental authorities who have joined us in this cession , next time we shall resume the case of muvunandinda bernard
panel member and try mugisha andre . we hope you will come .
panel member we invite especially people who may have testimonies and offended parties as far as this case is concerned .
panel member another communique is that trial proceedings take place at the sector 's office .
panel member the office of sector 's gacaca court is established there .
this is the 30th of march 2004 , and we are at yves ' house in kicuciro in kigali . and this is yves . perharps you could tell me your name and your age .
my name is yves and i am turning 23 years old in august .
yves , how many were you in your family before the genocide , living here ?
before the genocide we were a family of six people living here . we were four children , my dad and my mom .
and after the genocide ... how many of your family members were murdered during the genocide ?
three of us were left after the genocide . both my parents and my big brother were killed during the genocide .
could you tell me what are your first memories ? if you were to think back to when you were a child , what is one of the first things that you remember ?
the thing i would remember is maybe the way we would all be together , chatting . my father used to make us laugh very much . he was very funny . he used take us for a ride . my big brother also used to make us laugh so much when we would be just the children .
how would you describe your relationship with her ? what did you do together ?
tell us about your father . you said he was a funny man . what things made him funny ?
tell me about your big brother .
did you all enjoy music together ?
yes because he used to teach me and tell me what was on fashion . he loved to read and to listen to the radio . he used to teach me how to dance in the bedroom . he would show me how to dance and i would imitate him .
tell me , when you look back and remember your family , what is it that you remember ? happiness ? warmth ? fun ? what is the strongest memory that you have ? love , care ?
during the genocide , what is the memory , which is the strongest , the most difficult for you to recall ?
where were you at that time ?
we had gone to my grandmother 's place before it started . they said that here in kigali there was no security and the best thing to do was to split into two and maybe some of us would survive . i was in gitarama at my grandmother 's place ; it is called igitwe .
how did you find out about the way in which your family was killed ?
what was the relationship between your dad and that soldier ? were they good friends ?
if you saw your dad with that particular man , what would their relationship have been ? friendly ? would they drink beer together ? would they work together ? would they sit and talk ? what was that relationship like ?
do you know how your mother died precisely ? did somebody tell you ?
from where you were in gitarama , did you see the killings taking place , not of your family but ... ? if so , what did you see ? how did the killers go about doing their work ?
how did you feel ? what was your predominant emotion at that time ? what was your main feeling at that time yves ? how were you feeling inside ?
when did you find out about your parents and brother ? when did you find out what had happened ?
could you describe for me something that you saw during the genocide that really stays in your mind that you can not get out of your mind ?
what does it mean to be a survivor ? what is the consequence for you as a person ?
how were your parents buried yves ?
can you tell me where you found them and when you found them and how you found them ?
people had seen them as they were at the neighbours . even my sister who was with them saw the way they killed them . he showed me the place and we decided to exhume them as the grass was growing over it in order for us to bury them in a better way no matter how hard that was . at least we buried them the way everyone else is buried , in a way that honours them .
yves , do you think you can forgive the people who killed your parents and your brother ?
do you feel that justice has been done for you and your family ?
i once saw one of the people who were present and who were happy about it even though he is not the one who killed them .
what did you say ? what did you do ? how did you react ?
do you think we learn anything from the genocide ? is the genocide useful in any way ?
personally the genocide taught me the value of life , it taught me to appreciate having parents . loosing them is what makes you realize the importance of having them . the genocide taught me respect for other people 's lives as well as respect for my own life . that 's it !
yves do you think the genocide is possible again here ?
i think it is impossible . from what i see i believe it can never happen again . when i look at the way today 's youth really fights against it all and the way they really want to fight it and remember it no matter how hard it is , and when we look at the consequences it had on us , i do n't think it is possible ! i think it is impossible ! and as we were saying , we need to do all we can for it not to happen again .
are you just being hopeful , or do you believe it ?
what do you think rwanda has to learn as a country ? and how is the best way to do it ?
what 's the most difficult aspect of being a survivor ?
you sleep and you 're woken up by nightmares of people with machetes who want to kill . or you remember the child you saw being killed . that 's the thing that i think can be such a challenge for the survivors . it affects them for the rest of their lives .
you said that your mother gave you advice on how to behave when she is no longer here . how have you done that ? what 's the advice that she gave you and how have you done that ?
you 've been working on the project in gisozi . why ... ?
thank you ! is there anything that you feel you should say that i have n't asked ?
my name is murengezi wilberforce . i am 58 years old .
wilberforce perhaps you could just tell me , how many people were in your family before the genocide ?
there was my wife and i and our five children .
and how many of your family are left after the genocide ?
tell me about your second child .
tell me about your third child .
she was a girl called kayitesi claudette . she was also in her last year of secondary school . she was not very healthy but she was very bright in school . i thought she would have a very good future . as any parent i wanted the best for her and since she was very good in science , i thought she was going to be a medical doctor .
what about the fourth born ?
my fourth child was francine ingabire . you have her on your photos . she loved her sister claudette very much ; she loved to swim . she was always there to talk to us after work , she would chat with us and ask her what we needed . not many children do that but she would come and ask us if we wanted a drink or some water or tea . she was a child who cared a lot about her parents . perhaps more than her older brothers and sisters did .
what is your special memory of her ?
yes i do believe in god and i still work for him until this day . i am not a pastor like my father but i do what i can . i love to sing and i lead some children in a choir . i do it because i guess there is a mission that god left me to complete in my remaining lifetime .
can you tell me how your wife and your children died ?
what happened to francine ?
about francine ... i do n't know anything about what happened to her . her younger sister does not say anything about her although she saw many things happen . but she just told me that they hacked her with a machete . i do n't like to ask her too many questions , because i know she does not like to talk about it . sometimes when i ask her something she answers , but she is unable to have a long conversation about it .
what does it mean to be a parent who has lost his wife and his children ?
so is justice possible or not ? do you feel justice has been done for your children ?
how does it make you feel personally that you were n't there when your family died ?
how would you like them to be remembered ?
but i believe that the younger generation and the youth , if they keep on teaching .... educational method is the primary idea . after all , it was through education that everything came up . therefore , education is what will take it away . nothing else can !

everybody used to go to church on that day , even the people who had not been to church in a long time . and it was the day we 'd eat special meals . and the other thing that made it special was that many families used to gather together on that day and share drinks , different local beers and several others .

umh ... umh ! she was hit with a hammer in the head and she immediately died . then they pulled her out of the house going to throw her body . but , they dumped her somewhere i used to play during day time .
what are your feeling about your grandmother when you remember her ? not what incident , but when you remember her as a person
eeh ... i feel so hurt whenever i remember that they killed her at a time when we were planning to shift and go to live in uganda . i always feel like if she had n't died , i would n't have seen the genocide and everything else that followed . we would have been outside [ the country ] . her death had many consequences on my life [ in the long run ] .
can you just tell me ... tell me what ... maybe what ... tell me what happened to your mother ?
my mother they ... on the 14th of april 1994 , that is when she was killed together with many others among our neighbours . they threw them in the river nyabarongo after they had hacked them into pieces and cut down their thighs . that is what i know that happened to her .
were you with her ?
i was not with her . it was during easter holidays . the war started while we were n't together .
how do you know what happened to your mother ?
on the 15th , as i was walking around the nyamirambo market when i met a man who told me how she died . he was from our home . later on , after the war , it was confirmed to me that what he told me was the truth .
do you know who killed your mother ?
from what i was told , they came in a big group of interahamwe but the man who killed her was called rwakatsi . he was our neighbour .
did you know that man ?
yes , i knew him ... we were neighbours .
can you say it in one or two sentences ?
can you just describe for me their attitude when they were doing it ?
can you descride for me that story you told me before where you saw a woman and her daughter being raped ?
i did not actually see them but i heard them . they were raping them some where down the place where i was hiding . it was a daughter and her mother . the daughter was about fourteen or sixteen years old . it was a big group of interahamwe in nyamirambo . i put some clothes in my mouth to stop myself from screaming so they do not find me . that 's all . i did not see them ; it was dark , at around two o'clock in the morning .
could you just describe that scene for me , because ... it is quite a difficult scene ? where were you at that time and how did you know what was happening ? could you just describe that for me ?
can you describe to me what was perharps ... the most difficult experience of being on your own during the genocide trying to survive ?
i would n't say that everybody was evil but the majority of the people were . if only few were wicked , it would not have reached such an extent . i would say that 5 % were good , the other 5 % was neutral and the 90 % remaining was evil .
how would you describe the ... if you had one sentence to say what happened in this country , how would you describe it ? was it evil and hatred ? was it madness ? what happened ? as you were trying to survive , what was going on in your mind about what was happening in this country ?

has justice been done ?
can genocide happen in rwanda again ?
i do n't think so , it can not happen again . because personally i do n't have a desire to kill in my heart . if the people who are being released today are going to be sensitised and if remembering what happened will be part of our lives , if there will always be a place where anyone even children themselves can go and acknowledge that it actually happened , and that it was wrong then i do n't believe the genocide will happen again !
what do you think about the future ? ... can you describe for me about the consequences of being a survivor ?
how do you want genocide to be remembered ? what is the right way to remember genocide ?
do we learn anything from the genocide ?
my name is uwimpuhwe alice . i am 20 years old and i am from tambwe commune , in tambwe sector , in nyamagana cell .
that is where i was when the war broke up . both my parents were there too . in fact at the time , when the war started , i think i was a little bit grown up , i used to see people coming to dad , talking to him , threatening him , saying that they would kill him . they were mainly our neighbours . it seemed as though they were in some sort of conflict . they were not friends .
as time passed , i saw the war really spreading , we run away . i was still with both my parents then . my dad was killed two days later . they came home , a man called kayishema took him away , and he never came back . we do not know what followed until today .
we were rescued with my mother and brothers and sisters , some suggested that we look for a way to go to burundi but when we reached the boarder , we were told that it was too late . no more crossing the boarder . therefore , we failed and came back .
on our way back , they wanted to kill me before anyone else . fortunately , there was a certain man who implored them to let me go with him because i had the same name as his daughter . he wanted me to go and help his children as a housemaid .
that man was called kayigamba , i still remember him . he was going to shoot me with an arrow . my mum begged him suggesting any possible arrangement rather than killing me in front of her . the man felt sorry for me and he later on took me to his home . my mum continued her way towards ruhango as she knew there was no other way .
she was not among those who came back . maybe she died by the roadside . neither her nor my brothers and sisters survived ; my two cousins and i are the only survivors in my family . i am the oldest one .
then benjamin came and told us @: that child and i , she was called gakecuru . he said , "@ i am taking you to be killed . @" then i frankly told him that he could n't take me . then he told me that if i did n't believe him , he would take the young girl first , to show me that he was serious . he took the young girl and she was killed .
when he arrived at home , he told me that i was the one next . i told him to kill me himself instead of delivering me to the perpetrators ; he used to say that he would let the perpetrators kill us so that he would not be responsible . i convinced him to take me back to the grandmother 's house where i was before maybe i will spend one night . that is what i told him .
i decided to go and commit suicide . i threw myself into a river , yes i did . but the river refused to take me . you know , it was full then as a result of the rainy season . the river threw me at the bunk . it was coming to morning as the day starts dawning when the river rejected me ; i could hear birds singing .
i suffer a lot on holidays . i get several problem i can not solve . nowadays , telling a rwandan about the problems i face is just a ... they would just talk about your problems all around . one has to come up with a decision . we live in that small house suffering . if anybody feels sorry for us ... life goes on .
how many were you in your family ?
we were four children .
and how many of you survived ?
would you remember all the people you met during the genocide if you saw them today ?
yes , i know them .
do you know anything as far as their lives are concerned ?
well , kayigamba is imprisoned . but i do n't know the prison where he is . i heard that abiya who was a doctor is now in kenya . that is what rumours say . he went with a girl called grace . grace was a girl we were hiding together in that home . he used to say that he was trying to save her and later make her his wife . then they went together but i have n't heard more about them .
in the orphanage .
my problem was the man called kayigamba . then i decided to leave the orphanage . i told them that i wanted to leave the orphanage . i said i would live the way god wished . i preferred working for someone as a housemaid to being abused by someone . i think by then i had completed my primary studies . then i left the orphanage .
then you left the orphanage and decided to become the head of a family . how old were you ?
i probably was 17 or 16 years old i think .
the children you were looking after , what are their age difference ?
the oldest is 18 years at the moment ; she is in secondary four . her young sister is in secondary two now .
do you still live with both of them ?
later he came to us and said , "@ even though you left us , you can come and pay us a visit . @" well , when someone told me something like that , in my heart i despise them , wondering why i should visit them then i say yes knowing very well that i would never appear in their homes . that is how my life went on .
when you are with your cousins , i guess that sometime you talk about life ... what kind of advice do you give them ? what do you talk about as far as your life style is concerned ?
as the oldest of all , i first calm them . i assure them that things will change for the better . i convince them how the future will be good and how we are going to get a better life . so i go ahead and tell them @: "@ although we have no job now , in the future we will get one , we are studying and we will get jobs afterwards so the future will be good .
i would like to ask you another question that is hard to answer but please , try and do . do you remember the people who harmed you ? can you tell them to us and what they did ? for example @: you can say so and so did me wrong yet he or she could have helped me .
i would like to ask you as a child who lives alone and as a child who has a lot of responsibilies , we all can see that it was n't your own choice , it is because you lost your parents when you were very young and in turn , you were left with responsibilities . what main challenges do you have as an orphan who is responsible for other children ?
what else is a challenge to you ? you told me that getting food is the first problem . do n't you have any other problem ?
given all your problems . do you find it possible to reconciliate with those who caused them to you ? i mean the killers who murdered your parents and caused you all these responsibllities at an early age .
are you talking about orphans or any other people who have such problems ?
orphans . what advice can you give them , so that they can be able to lighten the cross they are bearing ?
i believe there is nothing more .

i was also born in butamwa , but i did n't used to live there . the war started while i was at my grandpa 's .
where is that ?
in shorongi .
that means that everything that happened found you at your grandpa 's ?
no . most of the things happened when i had left . i immediately escaped .
what was your father 's name ?
dad ... ? he was called gatsimbanyi emmanuel and my mum was called niragire laurence .
how many were you in your family ?
they were six , plus me we were seven .
and how many survived ?
i am the only one who survived .
does that mean that they all died ?
all ! besides those who were not around . the only reason why my uncle survived is because he was living in exile ; he was n't in rwanda .
where were you living ?
we were living in butamwa .
in which year were you born ?
i was born in 1985 .
so how old are you ... ?
19 .
tell us about your life before the genocide . how were things then ?
q ...
when was that ?
it was around 1992 .
why would you do that ?
i ... i loved my grandpa so much , i can not explain it . maybe because he used to give me total freedom . there was a place that used to be close to the main road , i used to like sitting there at the road . and again he would let me graze the cattle while at home they would want me to just sitting there . yet there were no kids to play with . generally , i used to like my grandpa 's place . i was happy there .
your grandfather died ?
my grandfather died .
from your point of view , when do you think change occurred in your life ? when did you notice the changes ?
how did it start ? how did it start in 1993 ... ?
which cell was that ?
why did you stop studying ?
well at school , even my teacher was my relative . but i used to hate being beaten ... one time i went to school late , and when i was caned i just walked out of school and to hell ! i did n't see any importance of studying . even my grandpa had never gone to school and when i told him about it , he never had any reaction . therefore , i stopped studying . from then , i did n't go back to school . i went back to school only after the war .
did you go back in 1994 , immediately after the war .
no . i went back in 1996 .
q ...
i went there ... i completed primary during the school year 1995-1996 .
why did you go back to school ?
they told me to go back to school because they realised that there was nothing else i could do with my life . i was n't mature enough to look for a job . i just went to school up to now .
tell me how the war ... how did you face 1994 personally ?
there is apoint you mentioned that you joined the soldiers . how much time did you spend with them ?
i stayed there for two days . i just wanted to see the way they used a gun ; i enjoyed it . when i reached there , i found out that some people had been commanded to kill others . when i thought that they could even attack my grand father 's place , i immediately left .
at your grandfather , did they know where you were ?
i did not tell them anything , and when i came back they asked me where i had been , i told them but they did not say a thing .
q ...
how did you go , in a car ?
no , i left by foot . i left early in the morning and reached there at around six or seven in the evening .
were n't you afraid of walking or there was a way you would hide ?
at that time there were many people on the road screaming while hunting for people but i did n't fear anything at all because i could walk anyhow and no one stopped me , though i feared roadblocks .
when was that ?
did you start talking at the trauma center ?
when did you start telling it all ?
even now there are some things you skipped ... is there some information that you did not tell us ?
why ?
i believe a woman might waste my time . she might make me unhappy . however , i believe if i am lucky , i 'll come across one whose parents were killed in the genocide . however , i think it will n't be possible because all those orphans of the genocide will be married before i will be in position to marry and those who may be still single will be too old for me .
what would you like to do ?
i think after completing my studies , i 'll be self @-@ employed . i want to make a project and it will involve agriculture and cattle breeding , which will be based at my now deserted home .
that means that you want to study agriculture ?
i can not study agriculture because i am studying accounts . i think i will do "@ management @" at the university . but if i get a chance to study agriculture , i will do both since i feel i have it on my heart .
when you think about you future family , what do you think genocide will mean to them ?
how many times have you gone back since the war ended ?
that was my second time . which means i went there three times . the first time i went to see if there was anybody who survived as i believed they were still alive yet they all had died . the second time i had gone to look for an identity card and that is the time when i found a case . and the third time is when i had gone for a reply because they had asked me to go back on wednesday . however , i never followed it up , i just came back .

indeed i did ... it is just that nowadays it does not exist anymore and it 's become difficult to determine who is the last @-@ born .
and what about your elder brother whom you are living together , which born was he in your family ?
he was the first @-@ born in our family .
where were you living before the war ?
before the war , we were living in bugesera . by then , bugesera was in kanzenze commune .
tell us about your childhood , how you lived .
when you try to remember between 1990 and 1994 , when did you realize that there was a problem ?
when did you realize it was a big problem ?
was that in the beginning of the year 1994 ?
how many were the boys ?
did you ever get to know what happened to your family members ?
at night i would limp slowly by slowly ... there was an old lady whom we were hiding together , she could squeeze some herbs and apply them on my wound . that was the medicine that was available . time came when a person from our village came and told me that my older cousin and his other two brothers were still alive . the three brothers were all alive .
after stubbing him , the interahamwe went out of the church and started throwing grenades to the church . then they entered and started looking through the dead bodies to see who was still breathing . someone hid under the dead bodies . he came out after the interahamwe had left and started running with others who were trying to hide .
is he still alive ?
life continued like that . we kept on hiding from them , some died , we would be attacked and we kept on hiding . some out of our group would be killed . but my cousin had a small radio called mera . he used to walk around holding it in his hand but he would hide it in a bush from the public . the rest of the day we could spend it running and at night he would listen to the news . the batteries were not yet discharged by then .
people would wonder if those who went to burundi stopped running . were n't they killed on the way ? generally there were some people who were afraid of moving . they would prefer running around in the neighbourhood to dying on their way going somewhere . therefore , they would stay behind saying ; "@ we are used to running and we survive by chance . it is all the same , we can go and die in a place where we have never been before . @"
then they asked us to calm down , "@ we are on the same side . @" they told us . then they started to ask us about a lady who was living in our village bugesera . they said that she used to visit them in mulindi . we told them that she was still alive but the perpetrators had cut of her leg . then one of them said that before the end of the day he would have reached there .
when you were in the banana plantation , how did that gentleman come to you and convince you that he met a soldier and he is asking him to take all of you to him ?
you were living with your family at the market centre , do you know what happened to them ?
q ...
why did you join the army ?
given the life you experienced , where do you think rwanda is heading ?
are you asking me rwanda at large or you are asking me the political point of view ?
i am asking you in general .
q ...
do you believe that consequences of the genocide will affect your offspring ?
is there any particular message you would like to pass to the world at large especially to those who will came across this testimony .
the message i can pass on to all rwandans is to love one another and strive for the improvement of our country . the other thing is and i will not stop repeating it , anyone who denies the genocide should be opposed . thank you .
when they came home to kill , they were very many . some were armed ; others were carrying clubs and many other weapons . so they came home and found us there . we were very many ; some neighbours had come to hide home because they had no other alternative ; they could n't go and hide anywhere else . therefore , they decided to join us at home saying that , if it meant to die , we would die together . or if it meant to survive , we would also survive together .
so it happened but ... well , i managed to escape . they came at around six thirty , a big number ; it was an attack of about two hundred people . soldiers came first and then the interahamwe followed . they [ interahamwe ] were waiting to kill those who would manage to escape [ the soldiers ] . they used to call it ‘ finishing off ’ .
then ... well , some of them were pregnant , all the friends who were there ... i am the one who came out of there alive . it was in the evening when they started shooting us and they were very many . as i was lying down , i stood up and checked if there was anyone else who survived but there was none . there were only floods of blood .
but because by then i was ... well , i had become numb ; i could n't think of doing anything at that time yet i needed to find my way out of that place . it was n't easy to leave that place because i was difficult to find space where to step .
well , i hid myself and i was lucky to see a new day . that is when i got out of that place . i thought it was the end of everything and so , there was nothing i was waiting for . then i thought , " let me find a way of protecting myself and see if i would survive . @"
i tried all possible ways but i failed . then i started moving around . however i thought there were relatives who had survived nearby but they had all died .
that is how i survived and i was taken to the hospital . i was treated because i had been injured . but they only treated the wounds ; they did not remove the fragments that were inside the wound . in july , the war ended but things such as schools had n't started operating . then f.a.r.g [ funds for the assistance of the genocide survivors ] encouraged us to go back to school . we started the registrations and the ministry split us up in different schools .
now that you have told us about your life in details , i would like to ask you some questions ; could you please tell us your parents ' names ?
eh , my dad was called macumi francois and my mum was called umulisa odetta .
and how many were you in your family ?
we were two ... three kids at home . we were all boys . they all died and i am the only one who survived .
among all your brothers you are the only one who survived ?
i am twenty @-@ five years old .
before the genocide , you very well know that people would be hunted , tortured , others would be arrested saying that they were traitors or something of that kind ; did it ever happen in your home that you or your parents were tortured ? if it so , please tell us in brief how it happened ?
yes it used to happen especially within families . some people were victimized in that way . our families would shift ; they would be living on a certain hill and because on that hill , it would be said that they were inyenzi traitors , then our families would be forced to shift . i remember how my family was tortured and we had no security .
we definitely used to get such problems . in fact we were attacked three times at home before genocide started . but they never did any harm to us .
you told us some of your family members would be forced to shift . do you remember their names so that you tell them to us ? where did they go or where were they taken ?
yeah ... okay , there was ... well i can call him my uncle ; he used to live there in gikondo and in kinazi before . when they left kinazi , they went to cyangugu . they made move to cyangugu and then they came back here in gikondo .
it was well known that there was a tribal war between the hutu and the tutsi . and you told us that your father used to go in exile while your mum would stay at home . do you mean your father was victimised due to going out of the country or because of being a tutsi ?
could you please tell us in brief ... you said he was harassed due to his honesty but ... what was his behaviour ? the times you talked , what did he say he was accused of ? tell us in brief how he used to handle it .
he was victimized because other hutus would say , "@ this is our fellow hutu but he does n't behave the way we do . @"
he would tell them , "@ this is not the way things should be . @"
could you briefly tell us how your family reacted after hearing that habyarimana 's plane crashed ?
i remember i was revising my lessons and my mum was cleaning up my young brother in the sitting room . my dad owned a small bar where he was sharing a drink with other people , and then we heard that habyarimana died . i could tell that there was a change on my parents ' faces . by then we were young , and although they would not tell us exactly what was going on , i could feel the tension in my parents and in everyone who was at home .
tell us in brief ... from where he said , "@ let 's flee . @" what happened later ... if you remember the dates or if it was two or three days later ... up to his death , what happened ?
he tried making phone calls ... people who were outside the country would call him asking about the situation in kigali . they would say ; "@ we have heard that habyarimana 's plane was crashed , how are things there ? @" we were waiting to see what would happen because they had forbidden people to go out of their homes . nobody was allowed to go out of his or her house . but the wise men had already sensed what was going to happen next .
meanwhile he received several phone calls from inside and outside the country , people were asking him how the situation was . he would tell them , "@ i am at home with my family but we do n't have a way out . people are being killed in front of my house , things are horrible here . @"
although they were making plans , they were also afraid that my dad would fight them . indeed he tried though he failed ; they were very many . they first shot our gate ; it was a very big gate , they shot with so many bullets and it never fell down . they fought to open the different gates around the fence for two days in vain . it was one day in the evening when they finally decided to climb up the fence and get inside the compound .
for two weeks things were still the same ; phone calls time after time ... in that area where we were living , others had already fled . people 's houses were being burnt and people were being killed . generally there was no place to hide . two weeks later ... they came to kill us ... on a friday at around 6:00 p.m. i do n't remember well the dates but i am sure two weeks had passed .
that evening they entered our home . they jumped the gate and shot the front door and it opened . then they all entered inside the gate but we had locked ourselves inside the house . they ordered to open the door but my dad said , "@ whether i open or not will n't make any difference , they will still shoot the doors and open them by force . @"
he never thought that such a thing would happen . mostly , he felt pity for the children and the women who were n't able to run . he thought such people would easily be killed . at least a man is capable of fighting or running . even if they are shot while trying to run they can keep on running only if they are not fleeing with the rest of their family .
they got us out of the house . we were very many forming a rank and they took us outside . they would shoot every person to get out , i was the fifth person to be shot .
at the end one of them said , "@ this is not enough , open a grenade . @" they opened one . i even still have its scars somewhere here ; i have two fragments inside ere . as they threw the grenade , i was also hurt but it just felt like an injection so i ignored it . i thought in case i breathed , they would hear me .
therefore , they left . i was watching them as they were leaving . i rose up my head a bit but everybody was silent ; they were all dead . i stood up ... one thing i remember is the way i entered the house and picked up the blanket ; it was raining and the blanket was very big . therefore , i covered them and covered myself with a loincloth , which belonged to my mum .
i had lost my mind ; i would wonder if i should get into the house and sleep . i was confused . sometimes people cry but i did n't have tears to cry , not even a drop . instead i would think about what had happened to me and i 'd suddenly feel so confused .
there was nothing i could do for her , myself i had lost conscience due to what had happened to me . i left her after she had breathed her last breath . by the time i left , no one was alive ; my mum was already dead . they shot her three bullets ; two passed here , and the third one through here . my brothers were smashed with clubs and shot on the head . there was a big stream of blood .
but when you left , you never got a chance to know that ...
i never got another chance to know what happened next . i came back after the genocide like others ... the time the country was trying to be reorganized up . and i found only corpses lying in the compound . i tried to get people to help me ; they are some friends at the same sector who survived the genocide . they helped me to cover them with some soil so that one would think of what to do next ...
by that time , would you tell who your parents were or ... ?
by that time , i could n't identify my parents ' corpses ... wait , maybe the pair of trousers my dad was wearing or the loincloth my mum was wearing . i could recognize my brother from the piece the shorts or the shirt he was wearing . things like that .
were you ever able to exhume and rebury them officially ?
i was n't able to do that . you see those day life was ... people had just come out of those problems and the country was just trying to be rebuilt in an attempt to see if things could go back to normal . we did n't do anything special for their reburial ceremony . we just got some clothes and laid them inside [ the grave ] and covered them with some soil . then we ceiled the grave with cement , nothing else .
from the time you left your home .
when i left home i continued to walk . but even as i was going , there were some people who were behind me . they tried to hunt me all over to the extent of leaving kicuciro for gikondo looking for me ; we had houses there . therefore , they came to see if those attendants were hiding me . they found out that i never went there .
after you met the inkotanyi ... and they asked you to go and start looking for ways to live , what did you do or where did you go ? whom did you live with and how would you get your daily bread ?
what happened later after they left me , i went to kicuciro . there is someone from my family who had survived but i never knew ... when the war began , i guess it was one week later , we were told that they killed them . therefore , i thought they had all died . i went to remera near iamca , where kie [ kigali institute of education ] presently is .
then i met a certain man who had come from uganda ; he knew my family . he took me to school in uganda . i studied there for a while and came back to rwanda . i registered here and started studying from here slowly by slowly . that is how things used to be . i would meet friends and they would help me because they knew what happened to me and life went on .
i finally got used to it and started living a normal life . i would say that , even though genocide took place , one has to look for a living and ignore all that happened . one can never forget what happened but life has to go on .
did you manage to finish school ?
i used to have a problem of headaches . i would be attentive in class but all of a sudden i would get terrible headaches . another problem was due to my arm ; it would hurt me so much and i would n't ...
you said you suffered a lot . but you never explained very well to us how you suffered .
eh ... the way i suffered ...
what happened in your life in general ? not just that but also in your whole life from the time you lost your parents up to now . what has been the most challenging thing ?
loosing both my parents ? well ... first of all i started another kind of life , which i was n't used to . because when you live with your parents especially when you are still young , there are some things ... there is a certain age you reach ... that is when they have brought you up and then you reach at a certain level where you can look for your own living . i entered another life that i was not used to .
living without anyone to help me in my plans ; let 's say , getting something i needed . those are the things that would disturb me . the fact that ... those are things i noticed . the way i saw people dying and the way i was skipping corpses , people i would run to hoping that they would save me who instead also wanted to kill me . until when i met the inkotanyi .
i remember there was a man who lived here and we met at sainte famille . he assured me that he was going to save me . but we reached somewhere and i noticed that where he was leading me , it was towards a certain pit . i escaped him and run away ; i escaped though crowds of people who were there and he never knew where i went .
i saw different things in life . i saw people suffer . i saw how after the genocide orphans got problems , i included . i got used to a different life style . god helped me now i am used to the new life style . there is a saying that , "@ akabi ntikamenyerwa nk'akeza . @" it means it is more difficult to get used to bad things than to good things . but later you get used due to the situation . yeah ...
life went on like that ... i would tell some people my problems and some would help me when they could . until i got totally used to it and i grew older , which made me so happy .
in your lifetime , what is the most painful memory ? something that takes away your joy . what hurts you most whenever you remember it ?
living without my relatives ... no family , which is the most important thing ... living without anybody to tell my problems . sometimes i say , "@ i could get this or that in such a way , but since there is nobody to help me , what can i do ? @" then i remember that , i could have been with my parents or relatives and they could have helped me in such a time .
however , it does n't discourage me . secondly i am hurt by the kind of life orphans lead yet they were n't meant to live that way . especially when they are three or four orphans who can not help one another . it is a pity .
well ... even if you are an orphan , life has to go on whatever the case may be ...
yes , that is true life has to go on . and it is still going on .
what advise can you give someone like you who passed through such hardships and who experienced a hard life ? those who lead a life like yours ?
what message can you give to the survivors of this genocide ?
the message i would give them ... well , they have different categories , because some survivors ... their way of understanding things are different due to the kind of life they are leading . there are some who found none of their family 's possessions left at their home sector , umh ! but the families of those who killed his or her people are still there living peacefully .
what do you think about the action of commemoration that people normally take ?
today you are leading a life that is different from the one you would be living if your parents were still alive . you certainly desire a better life . whom do you think should play a role in improving your life and for you to get peace at heart ?
saying that one has a role to play in it ... f.a.r.g tries its best to help some of us . the fund tries to advice those who are leading a difficult life about how they should behave in such a situation . i believe in life it ’ [ s important to ... not that we should wish for things we will never get or let someone make promises they will never fulfill ...
i believe reconciling all rwandans would be a very big step forward . when you consider where we are at , there is no longer time for conflicts . it is time for every rwandan wherever he or she may be , to love his or her country . they should love each other as rwandans . rwandans should unite and put hands together in the development of their country . conflicts and rivalry only make us move backwards , which result into fights within the nation .
there is no interest in conflicts . instead , i believe reconciliation based on principles for developing the country would be a big step forward for a better life . i believe they should first understand clearly how important reconciliation is and what an important step it is .
in your opinion , do you find it possible for rwandans to reconcile ? and if it is impossible why is that ?
in my opinion , reconciliation among rwandans ... well , it is possible but it will be a long process . but in the end it will happen . it is even taking place nowadays . today people do interact yet they belong to different ethnic groups . they talk with no problem . they visit each other . and when it 's time to share , they share .
but it is possible it is on its way ... and personally , i think those who do n't want to move forward and make that step are fools . because there is no way one will live alone in this world ; there is no way one can decide to live with only one ethnic group . it is impossible .
some people would always put forward the issue of ethnicity . i have just understood that your parents were from different ethnics groups . how do you feel about it ?
you just mentioned survivors who say that , "@ hutu killed my people . @" do you personally believe it were the hutu who did you wrong or do you believe it were the tutsi ? which of both sides do you blame ?
i believe it was the hutu who did me wrong because no tutsi would have come to kill me . first of all , there was no way tutsi would come to kill me since we had no problems with each other . secondly there was no way they would find the courage to kill us yet they were also hunted . i guess you understand that they had no possibility of killing me . but since the hutus had the power and the ability to do anything they wanted , they are the ones who killed .
there is a certain program for gacaca courts , which is meant for punishing the criminals . what can you say about it ? in the name of revealing the truth about the genocide and bringing reconciliation among rwandans , what is your view about gacaca courts or how do you understand it ? what do you think about it ?
the way i consider the issue of gacaca ... well , something i always thank this government for is the way they took all the people who did the propaganda to arusha . it was important to let the other perpetrators be judgeded from their local courts where the local people have access . because ... for example if someone killed in gikondo or remera and he is imprisoned in muhima ; there is no way someone from muhima would accuse him without knowing him .
therefore , it is better to keep people in the prisons located in their areas of origin so that they get convicted . i believe it was a very good idea . because if they had not simplified it in that way , maybe it would be more difficult to judge them . but when they take the prisoners in their respective provinces , communes and cells , it facilitates the judges who examine their cases . and it becomes easy for the witnesses to have access to the courts .
there is no way you can witness someone whose trials are taking place in nyamirambo when you are from gikongoro . it is hard to get means of transport or accommodation ... i guess the idea was good . so that the defendant are judged and punished for their crimes .
it is unbelievable that a neighbour could actually have the courage to kill his or her neighbour ... that someone would come to your place and kill your whole family when you used to go to the same school with his children or when your families intermarried , or when they used to pay you a visit when you threw parties at home . i believe gacaca is very good idea .
what do you think of the program of getting prisoners to say the truth about people 's death and ask for forgiveness ?
i would want to try and teach him the truth . so that he may never be affected in his life as grown up . i would encourage him never to believe in such ideas . i would tell him that his grandparents were killed either because of the ethnic group they belonged to or because they were supporting a certain ethnic group . i would tell him so that he grows up knowing what happened . and the point would be to avoid him wasting his time doing the same thing .
in the past while you were still with your parents , you saw the government , the political parties and the development that were in the country then . what do you think is the future of this country when you consider its past ?
our country 's future ... well the first thing i am thankful for is the government of unity ; it is trying to bring back rwandans into transparency . they also try to find a way of punishing those interahamwe who did those things [ killed ] so that it all comes in the open ... in the future there would be no more bad spirit among rwandans . things like hacking one another or killing one another .
therefore , i believe the government played a great role and now the country is developing ; new houses are being built , there is a change in the governance . generally , things are changing for the better . according to me , as years go by , the country will farther develop .
is there anything you would like to add on the testimony that you are giving us ? it could be a message or anything you would wish to say as a conclusion .
i think that is all .
then the man told me that , "@ young girl , get out of my house . when he told me like that ... it was about the 20th ... then i said , "@ fine . @"
the 20th of april ... ?
i told him that , "@ now i have left . @" then he asked me that , "@ please go and never think about coming this way . hope you can see that next time they will demolish my house . @" i told him that , "@ do n't worry , i am going . @" again i sloped down . but some times i wonder , i think that is god works ; i always say that if the sorghum plantations were not there , no one would have survived among those who survived in rubengera .
what time was it ?
i went to the road and sat there . while i was sitting there , i the burgomaster passing again . on his pick @-@ up behind , there were people saying that , "@ we have finished all the tutsi , they are all dead . the rest you should work hard rewards are awaiting . @"
as i was sitting there , pastor kanani came ; he was holding his bag . then he told the old man , "@ we heard that in your home , there are gahizi 's children who survived , now these people are on my case . they said they must kill them or take gahizi 's cows , which remained here . @"
when was that ?
it was in the late june ... in fact the month of june had ended , it was in july . because i would hear people saying that , "@ there has remained one month or one and half month for students to begin studies . @"
i went to school . eh ! at break time they would make fun of me . even those we used to talk together , they would avoid me ; they would behave to me as if i was a stranger .
was that in september when the genocide had stopped ?
it was after the genocide . but still moving ... unless i was going to school with other students ... that time people were still hiding ; no one would move out yet these ends things had settled without any problem . us we were still hiding . whenever i would not be able to get people to go with or come with , i would find a way of coming back in the dark at night .
you were still living in that family ?
it was on the 1st of october in 1994 .
generally , right from april life seemed to be a terrible struggle ?
from april to september life was a terrible struggle .
well , let 's talk about life from the time you joined munyagishari 's home ; that time when the war had seized , did your standards of living improve some how ?
how could you find your relationship with munyagishari 's children after the genocide ? how was it ?
do you meet often ... is there ... ?
i have never gone back to her home .
since the genocide stopped you have never managed to go there ?
no !
is it because you do n't want or it is failure to go there due to some other factors ?
it is not because i do n't want ; rather , it is by lack of means .
does that mean you have never gone back home from the time genocide ended ?
since genocide ended , we went back there in 1995 .
has your property been destroyed ... ? are there only ruins left ? ... has it ...
yeah ! the doors were still having the same color . you could also see that some of the bricks were from our house .
let 's think back a little bit on the period during the genocide . you spent a lot of time living in the sorghumfield and outside ... can you estimate how many days you spent in that time ?
it is obvious that at a certain time , you spent a lot of time in the sorghumfield . can you tell me about the time that you were chased from munyagishari 's place ?
i would just go till ... so many times , one would feel like the doors of death were locked up for him @/@ her as he @/@ she would look for dying ... the next thing was just going back home and flee again in case the perpetrators were back again and so on ... that 's how life was like .
i mean all the time right a fter being separated from your sister ... was it like one week or ... how many weeks did you spend outside ?
we stayed in the sorghumfield from april to july and for me , there was no other hiding place . everytime i was chased from where i was living , my refuge was in the sorghumfield . there was nowhere else i could go !
how was your life like before the gebnocide ? tell me a bit about the way your family . did you have many cows , how was your relationship to your relatives ... ?
ten years ago , i was in the 4th class of primary education and my younger in the third one . after the war , i went back to school and completed the primary level as long as my younger sister . thereafter , i completed secondary school . today , my younger sister is in senior six . i lived with my auntie by then till now . of course life is not the same , it is certainly different from the one during the genocide but it not the same as the one before the genocide .
are you hopeful about future ?
were there times during the genocide where you could feeling like you would better die than ...
yeah , very often ! that was the best solution for me .
does life make sense for you today or you wish you would die ... what 's your impression about life ?
the programme that the government has adopted is to emphasize on the fact that people have got to live in a new way . what do you think about gacaca and the system of releasing prisonners who have handed themselves over ? can you tell me what you think about unity and reconciliation ?
after genocide , the country had to face the problem of orphans ... what do you think of the way the current government takes care of orphans ? do you think it is enough ? what do you think of the way you 're treated by the rest of the society ? do they pay you a visit ... ?
you have been an orphan for quite a long time despite the fact that you 're an adult today ... do you have a message to give to other children who survived the genocide the way you did ?
this testimony will be watched by many people , maybe even by your grandchildren . i would n't want to let you go without giving you an opportunity to give a message to those who will watch it , something that 's on your heart . this is therefore the opportunity to tell us what is on your heart and what your wishes are .
i guess that is enough .
my name is umulisa marie @-@ claire . before the war we were living in kamonyi district in gitarama province , in a sector called murehe .
therefore , we waited to see if mum or other people from home would come but none turned up . we neither know how people from home died nor where they died except dad who was killed at a certain center where they had taken him . that is where they killed him .
it was river nyabarongo . we were drowned my sister and i. we did not come out together . i came out from this side of kamuhanda and she came out from across the river in a place called nyagatovu . that is where she came out .
did she tell you how she crossed the river in order to go back to where you had come from ... i mean where you all saw each other again ?
yes she told me . she walked up to the road that goes to shyorongi and then continued up to the brigde that is between runda and taba . then she went to the house of the old lady whom we were related ; she was my mum 's aunt .
you talked about some interahamwe who were prisoned , like minani , yansoneye and others . do you remember ... or do you know what happened to them ? because , i believe it is minani who cut your leg ...
what about the other interahamwe ... you never know they may be the ones who killed your parents or your other relatives . do you know anything about them ?
in the group of attackers who first attacked our home , the person we managed to identify was karekezi . he is the one who took our father away . and since our father left , he has never come back . but i do n't know if he is the one who killed him or his companions because they were very many . but he is the only one i knew in the whole group of attackers . he is called karekezi . he is the only one whose name i knew .
undefined
i do n't know about that . i do n't know if he actually admits that he killed those people . but when you try asking him , he says , "@ i killed a lot of people and i can not tell the exact number , all i know is that i killed so many people . @"
did he come to apologise to you ?
no he 's never come .
well , considering that , what do you think of the gacaca court ?
what i think about gacaca court ... people who killed had a goal in doing so . therefore , when someone comes to me asking for forgiveness because he killed people , my people ... they killed intentionally with all their hearts ... therefore , the law should punish them according their crimes .
there is something that is often talked about , something concerning unity and reconciliation . to somebody like you who was hurt to that extent and who is still suffering the consequences of their deeds even today . do you find it possible ... or what is your point of view ?
well , when a person experiences some things the way you did and then lives the way you are living due to his or her past , he or she gains some life experience . therefore , what does it mean to you as a genocide survivor ? could you explain about it ?
there is something i would like us to talk about more specifically . you see you are a person who experienced tough times and you have seen a lot of things . however , all was as a result of the loos of your parents due to the war . do you remember how things were before the war ? can u tell us about it ? how were you living ? would you please tell us about your life at home before the war ?
i noticed that the most special person in your life after the war is your sister . what can you tell us about your sister ; how old is she and what are her plans ?
is there any message you could give genocide orphans ? especially those that take care of themselves or even to those that are looked after . those young kids should have a way they should behave ...
you know this tape is going to be watched by many people . your own kids or even grandchildren might one day watch it because it is going to be well kept . do n't you have more advice or a message to add on this testimony ? anything you may need to talk about to rwandans at large or survivors in general . you can say anything ...
what about children ?
considering the problem of foreign countries that deny that there was genocide in rwanda , do n't you have any message to give them ?
what do you plan for your future ? what is your plan for the future ?
do you have any additional messageto add to your testimony ?
my name is olivier ruyenzi , son of venuste karasira and of speciose mukakarangwa . i was born in 1984 .
where did the grenade hit you ?
on the head [ he shows above the ear . ]
so they 'd been killed and when we found out , we organized ourselves and made some sort of a souvenir ... a way of commemorating their death . we ... my parents also inquired about the rest of our relatives and found out that only my dad was still alive and his younger brother who lived in uganda and his sister who lived in butare .
how many were they before ?
they were five and 3 of them remained . in mother 's family , no one survived . not even one ! no one of her relatives survived ... so life went on ...
how was it at the time of multiparty system ?
before the multiparty system ... i mean after , when the cdr , mrnd , mdr power propaganda started ... it started mostly when the inkotanyis came to cnd ...
how was it ?
they first attacked the house , they come and search for things , they 'd come about twice a weeks ... that 's when we started fearing ... they were ... they 'd get everyone to sit down in the sitting room ... they 'd come , search around and go back , having found nothing .
how were they when they 'd come to you ? ... what did they used to say ?
they used to come in a group , saying that tutsis were n't trustworthy . they were suspecting us to be hiding people or maybe to be in contact with the soldiers who were at cnd .
you told me your mom was hit by grenades ' fragments ... does she suffer any consequences today ?
abari bari mu kigero cyo ubu turimo nibo babaga babasigaranye akenshi . most of people knew each other then . i can not recall their names but they looked familiar although we did n't know everyone 's name ... they were people who lived in the same neighbourhood as us and so we knew each other . we even used to play football together despite the fact that they were older than us . the ones who had our age today were the ones to ...
how many choldren were you in your family before ?
six children .
six children .
only florence who was my older sister .
do you know how they were killed ?
she is the one who died ... she had gone to visit her godmother in gikongoro where she was killed with the children of the latter .
what do your parents do today ?
how did your wounds come to heal ?
who are those white people ? what were they here for exactly ?
they are doctors who had come here to help out . one of them is a priest and the rest are doctors who had come to visit the kicukiro health centre and to see what had happened in rwanda and know more details about it .
how was byumba ?
life in byumba was like ... it was like starting in a new life . apart from the pain , from seeing some people crying , others dying due to the wounds . it was a new life after the shootings , bombings , screaming ... it was like going back to a normal life .
how do you compare it to life before genocide ?
he fled with other people but we do n't know who they were , we even tried finding out who they were but we never found out . even the godmother 's daughter who survived does n't know exactly what happened ... she just remembers them leaving , each one in their own direction , she was behind and she never saw them again ...
do you find it easy living with the people who betrayed you , how do you handle such a thing ?
living such a life is of course affecting us in a way but we need to endure life and accept reconciliation as they say . but ... life goes on despite the scars that are obvious to everyone . they also see them and it certainly affects them as much as it affects us .
do you think unity will be possible ?
it will be difficult to see it happen but it will come with time . as people will get to give out their testimony or get to tell what happened to them in public , they 'll feel released . i believe we will one day reach unity .
how do you think unity could be built ?
how do you feel about the future ?
suspicion will go with time . but there are some things you simply can not erase from the heart , some people do n't believe we should live in unity , they can not erase it from their hearts but it will come slowly .
it 's been ten years since genocide happened in rwanda ... what changes do you see ?
how do you see rwanda 's future ?
we have the vision 2020 but again ...
what kind of a country do you think the future generations will be living in ?
do you believe there 'll be development ?
i am a student and i can go forward through my studies or in the area in which i 'd like to pursue my education . i study computers . i have just finished secondary school and i am going on with my studies . a job is something you have to look for , it does n't just come to you . then life will be good , no one wants to live a bad life .
many people will watch this testimony , probably among them will be your future children . what message would you like to give to those who will watch it ?
the message i 'd like to give them is to look for the message that 's in it when they watch it . that 's the message i 'd like to give them ... i 'd to encourage them to think it through so it never happens again , to keep it in their hearts so that the same thing does n't happen again or we find ourselves in the same situation all over again . i 'd encourage people to think through the different things they 'll see on different recordings .
how would you describe rwanda ?
rwanda is a country inhabited by people called rwandans . people who have had different lives ... their problem is that there are tribes among them and some of them started killing each other , it 's been acknowledged that genocide occurred . genocide happened against the tutsi tribe just like there was genocide against the jews . the tutsis in rwanda were genocided . but now it is coming to an end as rwandans are reconciling .
what do you call genocide ? what proves that it happened according to you ?
anything you 'd like to add to your testimony ?
i 'd like to add that i believe unity will be attained in rwanda in this generation .
my name is ruhurambuga marcel . i was born in a place formerly called mukingi commune , but now known as ntenyo district in gitarama district . we were eight brothers and sisters in my family .
did you fall back into it twice ?
what was she suffering from ?
we met the inkotanyi at kazinganyoni near byimana . when we reached their roadblock , my sister got so scared , she thought the roadblock belonged to habyarimana 's soldiers . but i convinced her that according to the directions we had been given , habyarimana 's soldiers were not here . then we proceeded and reached the roadblock . i can not tell where soldiers came from , they suddenly appeared and surrounded us .
what happened for your neighbours to betray you ? because according to what you told us , they seemed to be like relatives . how did they change ?
does it mean that you had already understood that they would kill you ?
in 1994 in gitarama there was a political party called mdr , how was your life then ?
would n't they force you to join those parties ?
such things happened but we would take it lightly ; for example , stealing or cutting people 's banana plantations . but serious torture like beating a person and others ... well there used to be some moral torture like scaring people , nocking on the doors at night . those are the things that they would do . but to us , it meant nothing .
is there any other problem you got as a result of your ethnic belonging [ tutsi ] ?
no , there was n't any other problem . however , even what was done to us was due to out ethnic belonging [ tutsi ] it was the hutus who were doing that and we were the only tutsis who lived there . all our neighbours were hutus . definitely one could tell they were the ones to do all those acts !
you told me that you come from gitarama . were you born there ?
yes , but while we lived in mwendo , our home origin was in karama . our grandfather had shifted to mwendo and we lived on his land . he had a very large land . the reason i am saying that it was very large is because he was living there alone . he had few relatives and therefore seemed to own a big land . he was living there with a few of his relatives .
you earlier talked about people who were fleeing from kibuye towards kabgayi . would you please elaborate more about that ?
q ...
in that pit ... while they were throwing us in the pit , the perpetrators would say they would cover it after adding more 20 people . well i do n't know the exact number but i would think they were over thirty .
how many people were in pit the time you exhumed them ?
how many pits were there ?
two pits .
what was the distance between the two pits ?
about 300 meters .
people in your area would kill some people and leave others . what was determing their choice ?
actually those who killed us were our neighbours and we knew them . not only the killers , but also those who looted our properties . for example , i know who killed my elder brother .
where does your mother reside now ?
now she is living in ... at first we lived in byimana centre . we no longer live there ; we shifted to a place called imbare next to shyogwe opposite to kabgayi in avega estate . she lives with my sister who lost her husband during the genocide .
what does she do ?
nothing , she is illiterate . before she was working in an orphanage looking after orphans but the orphanage closed and now she is just at home helping mum in the farm .
how old were your parents then ?
my father was born in 1935 that means that by then he was about 59 years old . while mum was born in 1944 .
in which year were you born ?
he was about 21 years old . i guess he was born in 1974 . maybe he was 20 years during the genocide since he was born in 1974 .
q ...
we were neighbours . the distance between our homes was about 500 meters . presently his father is under custody because he was involved in my older brother 's murder . he was participated in the murder of my brother , shyaka , his older brother called aphrodis munyanziza , their younger brother called mukaka damascene and several others . all that man 's family and the soldier were there while my brother was being killed ; they all participated in his death .
the time you were led to the pit , what was on your mind ? tell us a bit of your experience .
when you gained conscious did you manage to ...
you were so afraid that they would get you for the second time but you still followed them . why were you following them ?
then after the genocide you were fatherless ...
so , to you fis that an advantange or it is a disadvantage of the genocide ?
do n't you get desperate at times ?
i feel desperate but only for the time when i am thinking about my problems . but when i meet friends i forget about it . and then the feeling comes back during the holidays when i am at home seeing the situation in which my family is living . i get so desperate because i see everything yet i can not improve anything .
does it disturb you to the extent of spending sleepless nights or getting headaches ?
what would you want to be in the future or what is your goal or wish in life ?
what do you wish to do for your family ?
what i can do for my family ? i am not sure , with the life i am leading now i can n't promise anything . i hope to first finish school then look for a job and that 's when i will be able to help . otherwise if i start promising now , it might stress me or depress me yet i will n't loose anything if i wait until i finish my studies , start working and then help my family .
what would you want someone who does not know what genocide is ? what would you want them to know ?
when comparing the past to the present , what changes have you experienced in your personal life ?
what can you tell people who do n't agree that genocide happened in rwanda ?
to someone who is still young , what do genocide memorial sites mean ?
it seems like you are fighting against forgetting about the genocide . what would "@ forgetting @" mean to you ? why are you really against forgetting ?
listen ... what it means to me , when you forget things especially bad things that happened to you , it means that what happened meant nothing to you . if you can forget your father 's death , your mother 's death , and your relative 's death , deaths that caused agony to the whole country [ rwanda ] , and rub out all your beloved ones from your brain yet you were left alone in this world , without anyone to talk to or to run to , to me that would be an unforgivable sin .
what can you tell those who do n't know rwanda ?
and what do you think about the other lady ; your cousin 's wife ?
is this your first time to give a testimony ?
it is not my first time . besides telling it to my friends , i have given a testimony twice before . the first time it was at byimana where we were exhuming remainings of people . many people were killed in that area and now we constructed a memorial site there on the behalf of the district . i gave out my testimony the day we reburied them . this is the second time .
the first time you gave a testimony , did n't you feel anything ?
how do you feel now as you talk about it ?
what message can you give to the foreigners or rwandans of today or in the future ?
to you , what 's the importance of remembering and giving value to genocide ? what would you wish to be remembered forever ?
do you want to add on anything ? we still have twenty @-@ six minutes extra .
tell us your age ...
my age ... ? i was born in 1954 .
but they should punish those people accordingly so that the culture of not punishing stops . that way , the habit of killing one another will stop . even that one who had a thought of killing would stop because he or she knows she would be purnished for it .
i would like to ask you some few questions in order for us to fully understand what happened . you told us that in 1959 you already existed but you were still young . but you can tell us the little you remember about the way they attacked how it was in your area , how you fled or what happened to you . just tell us in breif what happened during that time .
we fled . i remember that in 1963 i was very young . we fled after they attacked our home and burnt our houses . we fled to a certain hill , which was a bushy . we had a lot of cattle ; therefore we migrated with them . however they demolished our houses though .
what was the name of that hill where you were living before migrating ?
do you know by names , anyone who was killed ? for example you can tell us that ; so and so , their houses were demolished and later they were killed ...
in our family ... ? are you talking about the time in 1959 ?
yes between 1959 and 1963 , within that range ...
when you ran to that hill , did you return home ?
while still there ... meanwhile , you reached at some point and got married ... ?
yes , that was in 1973 . i got married in 1974 .
so you had a chance of getting children ?
yes , but one died and the father .
would you tell us briefly what happened in the period of party @-@ struggles , was your family tortured ?
and finally they came to your home ... ?
what about others in your family ?
another person of whom i remember , they were not living in kigali . but i remember my niece who lived in cyahafi . they were dumped in a latrine . their bodies were exhumed by ibuka and taken to gisozi memorial site for reburial . their remains are in their final resting @-@ place at gisozi together with others . it is my niece and her husband and their two children . they were dumped in their own latrine . other people ...
do n't you remember how they were killed ? were they hacked to death or ... ?
yes of course they are there . they were hacked and others were chopped with knives . in fact , the one who was the chief of interahamwe in their home area was arrested . unless he admit his crimes and get released . or maybe he is already released ... in cyahafi ... [ she gulped ] i do n't often go there .
do you have some of your family members that you managed to exhume and reburry officially ?
you told us that the inkontanyi helped you ... they took you to saint andre but can you tell us how you left that place and your life experience in sait andre ... ?
no , i would be lying if i said yes . but still there are some who have been traumatized and one of my nieces who is handicapped by bullets and has an amputated arm ; she was shot and she watched her arm born jumping out of her body through the muscles . so she was also terribly affected by the genocide
do you live with her ?
no , she lives in nyamirambo at her father 's place . her father too survived .
after the genocide when the inkotanyi liberated the country , there were several government bodies that came up , whicha emphasis much on unity and reconciliation policies . form your personal point of view , do you thing it will work out for the hutus who perticipated in the genocide to reconciliate with the tutsi survivors ?
so , do you thing that the commission in charge of unty and reconciliation will reach its goals easily ?
there are other organisations concerned with the rwandan genocide , which are non @-@ governmental . plus several other commissions around the contry like that of unity and reconciliation . and there are also judicially commissions called gacaca . i guess , are in operation . what can you say about them ? do think they are going to help in purnishing those who perticipated in the genocide ?
hope that is the advice to the children in general . now can you give any piece of advice to the children who were affected by the genocide ? what advice can you offer them about how to improve on them selves ?
that is the piece of adice that you have passed to the children . what about those who perticipated in the genocide ? what message can you give them ?
in order to avoid those feelings though you faced those problems . how do you fight againest those feelings ? what do you do personally ? the reason why i ask you such questions is , there are some people who may learn from you after they have seen your testimony . the way you stand in tough situations may be a leason to her of him .
do n't you have something to add on the testimony you have given us ? what message can you leave for the people who will see this testimony in the future ... ? it may be a message of comfort to any one of your wish ... it may be a testimony ?
the message i can give to all those who faced the genocide is to be strong . though all the time we have been strong . ten years is a big thing ! yet no one has ever run mad or looking funy . therefore , we have to keep it up and remain strong . because as years go by and as far as our children are growing and going to school , our problems will go on reducing .
ten years have passed and in few days to come there will be an occasion of commemorating for the ten years that have passed after the genocide , which took place in rwanda . all other nations admmitted that there was genocide in rwanda . does it have any meaning to you , hearing that other countries agree that there was genocide in rwanda ?
have you finished ?
when people would see you in such condition ... you can imagine what i was looking like , considering the way you see me now with these scars . i looked like a dead body with blood all over in the face . others would say , " she is taking her last breath she has no life in her . @"
we stayed together until she died in the year 2000 . we lived together until that time and a few of my cousins were also there . i was able to find some people who had survived . my life went on like that . i think that is all about my life during genocide .
can you continue telling us even the life after the genocide and who did you live with ?
q ...
meanwhile , i got a job at "@ acrg mpore @" [ it is an association ] . i was earning some little money , it was enough for me to feed those children . afterwards their uncle who came from abroad took them . then i gave birth to my own child , she is now two years old .
you have told us how you lived before the war , how you were treated in the society due to your ethnic or things like that ... what do you think is the difference between @: life before the war [ genocide ] and life after the war ?
there is a difference . because before the war people were scared . wherever you would be , people would be talking about ethnic issues and such things ... but now there is no segregation . maybe the only problem is about the prisoners they are releasing . but in general , there is a big difference . life nowadays is not the same as that before the war .
do you try to live with all types of people or do you feel closer to certain people ? do believe you can live with all people or there are only a certain type of people you can live with . i mean people you can discuss the issues related to the genocide . can you discuss genocide issues with anybody ?
what do you think about the families of those who murdered your family ? do they try to show you any ... i am asking you this because i would like us to talk about unity and reconciliation . is there any way you collaborate with the families of those who killed your people , to the extent where you can talk with them ?
there is a new government policy of asking the survivors to go round in the prisons and sensitize the killers to admit what they did and report themselves . do you support that idea ?
never , i can not handle it ! i can not manage to do that ; i am a 100 % against it .
let 's go back a bit before the genocide . some people we met told us that there was an ethnic problem in schools , everywhere ; did you face the same problems ?
yes it was there and it was brought by the authorities . you could n't expect good result when you tell the hutu to stand up and after tutsi to do the same , for what purpose ? we were asking ourselves what was all that for ? and our parents used to tell us that they were survivors of hutu persecutions in the previous years . they always used to complain about it .
... did you see any changes after 1990 or were things the same ?
that is when things got worse , the time the inkotanyi attacked . that is the time people started joining inkotanyi . i forgot to tell you that my brother had wanted to join the rpf , they caught him while he was in ngenda and put him in prison after seriously striking him . for them joining the inkotanyi was a big mistake and that would make them harass the families [ of the young people who would try to or manage to join the rpf ] .
was your family ever harassed ?
of course it changed ; for days , soldiers kept coming home investigating on dad , saying that he is the one who had sent him . in our area , the lowest level [ of the administration ] was led by tutsi , there was no hutu among them . so these authorities convinced the soldiers that the parents were not involved in it and that cooled down things . despite that , the genocide was later on generalized .
still in the 90s , political parties were created , such as cdr and mrnd ... did that affect you in your area or in your schools ? could you explain to us ?
it was similar everywhere . those who were n't mrnd members were persecuted but that did not stop us from being members of the parties we chose . even though there was so much tension , we were not going to pretend and be where we hated to be . our attitude was @: "@ if they are going to kill me because that , let it be so . @" there was a lot of tension .
going back to just after the genocide ... what do you think of the new program that releases prisoners who acknowledge their crimes and that reintegrates them in the society ? do you think it will help in the process of unity and reconciliation ?
when i think about that i find that it impossible . i think it will result into something worse . i do n't know if my opinion is similar to what others think . when i hear that i have goose pimples all over my body ; so i try to ignore it . can you imagine someone who has killed your people coming to live with you ? do you think it will be safe ?
you told us that your dad was from ruhengeri . were they neighbours with your mum or your mum came from a different place ?
they were all living together . in fact all the people of ntarama were somehow related , they came together and lived together that way .
did they intermarry ?
yes of course , i think i 've told you about it ... i partially said it . we were together at home and they told us to escape and leave them behind . they did not want us to die as handicapped people ... they wanted to stay ... as soon as we left , the perpetrators came and started killing . we even heard them screaming from where we were .
did any of your brothers or sisters survive ?
i lost two brothers in kabgayi . another one died at the front line and i remained with one ... we were two to survive . he died in the war in congo . we had only seen each other twice . he was coming to see me when he died . he died straight away . the others were killed while looking for a place where to hide like everyone else . they were hacked to death .
did you manage to exhume and rebury your people in ntarama ?
i have never been there . the day they were burying them i was here . i knew my parents ' bodies were at home . i went there once to bury them and i was so surprised ... it had been announced on the radio , it was in 1995 that people had gone to ntarama for burials ... when i went to bury them , i did not find them there . people told me they had been told to gather all bodies and to put them together at ntarama ...
tell us your name please .
tell us your name please .
bad sound .
we were here .
could you tell us what took place here ?
people were killed , that is what happened here . also there was a pit here . later on , we found about 7 people in there . there were other things piled on top of them , pieces of wood , stones ; there was even an axe , half of a machete that had been broken into two . that 's probably what they used to kill them with .
where are those people buried ?
those people were taken to gisozi .
when did you find them ?
we found them in 2004 , in the month of … in january .
were you able to find out who their families were ?
could you tell us who the members of your family were who were in here ?
there was mother , father and my older sister .
what was your mum 's name ?
murebwayire veneranda , dad was called hakizimana fidele and my older sister 's name was hakizimana rosine .
could you briefly tell us how they were brought down here … how they brought them here … what happened from the time they were caught until the time they were killed .
they cut them down and threw them into a pit , and then they put mattresses on top of them and burnt them . later on they came back to the convent . that 's when my dad was taken away . there were 5 interahamwes this time . two of them had guns , one had a hammer , two of them had machetes , that 's when they took him down and killed him as well .
were they killed the same way or was his situation worse ?
first , they hit him on the head with a hammer ; they took him pulling him across the ground . so you can understand that it was as though they had already killed him . later again , they slaughtered him , because when we exhumed them , there were traces of a machete on his head and here [ on the neck ] , revealing the bones .
so they are the ones who buried them here ?
they are the ones who buried them here .
do you know anyone else who is in here , perhaps your neighbour ?
yes , i do .
could you tell us who they are ?
there is baziga aloys ' family , some of them were our neighours , semana pierre 's family and his wife , there is also a child called mutama . there are many in there and i do not know them all .
how do you feel when you come here ?
i feel pain when i come here . this place reminds me of the many things that happened during the war .
do you like the way this place is kept ? do you think it 's the way things should be or do you have a different opinion ?
i do not appreciate the way it is now , i do not like it . i think they should be taken to a memorial site since this is somebody 's house anyway . there 's nothing that shows that these people were killed during the war . i believe it would be better to take them to a memorial site and people would visit them there .
my name is theodore bizimana . in 1994 , i was living here in nyakabanda , i was a mature , grown @-@ up person . i was 42 years old .
could you tell us what happened here ?
could you tell us how many people were killed here ?
right here . they 'd been thrown into a pit that was here .
could you please tell us how they were killed ?
they hacked them , shot them and threw grenades on them . the pit was a septic tank ... they had planned to make it into one , but it was not yet completely built . so they killed them and threw them in .
was it the head of the family together with his children and wife ?
yes , actually the mother was the head of the family , as the father died , of old age . therefore , it was the children 's mother , the children and the grand @-@ children .
what happened after genocide ?
after the genocide , people fled . when we came back from exile , we went back to our homes and we slowly found out where people had been killed . we arranged the pit , cemented it and left them in . later on , we wanted to bury them with respect and we exhumed them and took them to gisozi , last year .
thank you .
the following morning ... on friday we fled . we saw very many people fleeing therefore ; we also decided to join them . we were with our neighbours ; i was with my husband , my five children and one of them was a one year and two months old baby and my brother . we went and reached those ends of rubirizi , where we found other people and joined them . we continued together up to butare . we reached in burundi on the 05th may 1994 .
however it is a long story about the experience in burundi . therefore , we came back and reached here on the 16th july , 1994 . when i left burundi , it was a few days after the inkotanyi had captured kigali . therefore , we came here and a rushed forward with the keys expecting to find my clothes or other properties that we had left behind . but i found when this part was demolished . even the other house of ours was demolished .
i guess that it all i can say about that pit . but i left all the weapons they used to kill them in the pit . knives , the car chassis , stones ... all those weapons were stained with blood . therefore , we just buried them in the pit although we never covered it completely .
as you said that it was the interahamwe who were led by aloys , who did all those deeds . which kind of person was aloys ? and , how many interahamwe ( militias ) came here ?
could you please tell us your name ?
they brought us , they killed some people who were with us , they were more than seven . after killing them i escaped them , i passed between houses that are here nearby , i reached the dusty road , then i was raped by more than ten interahamwe , after raping me they spent the night with me , the next day i left and went back to my neighbourhood [ closer to where i was staying ] .
did you say that seven people died here ?
more than seven people died here .
where were they killed ?
they were interahamwe , they were no soldiers among them , they were interahamwe with guns others had tools .
how many were they ?
they were like ten , they are the ones who made us walk .
are those the only things they used to kill them , they killed them with guns ?
they shot them all , they shot them .
where did they shoot them from ?
they shot them from here in front of the bus stop sign , here at the bus stop sign , at the roadside .
we can see that it is at the road side , when you pass here do you tend to remember ?
yeah , i would really like them to , personally i would like everyone to , even though it is at the roadside to be fenced because bad things happened at the place during the genocide , people died from here , personally therefore i feel everyone should remember this place because of the bad things that took place here .
people who were buried here during the war , where were they put afterward ?
we reburied some and took them to nyanza , we managed to take my uncle where we originate from .
serafina my name is murekatete serafina , i was 26 years old during the war , interahamwe at that time walked us to this house where they raped us , i was together with other girls , we were staying nearby , they used to bring people when they are going to kill and kill them from here , just behind here there was a fence and even houses , you can clearly see that there is a farm , but before there were houses . 3 people were killed from here .
could you tell us what age group , gender , these people were ? were they children or men ?
one was a man with a family , the other one was an old man but not very elderly , the other was also a man .
who killed them ? interahamwe ? or soldiers ?
they were killed by interahamwe , because soldiers were rarely here , they were in republican guard barracks , others were on the other side at majyambere 's place , this place was mostly occupied by many interahamwe , who walked the peope who were going to be killed .
can you please tell us the number of the people who came for you , approximate if you remember ?
the number of interahamwe , the ones who worked down the road , are the same ones who worked even here , they were very many , they would make a big squad .
one can see that people lived here , were these people killed ? was the house destroyed at that time ?
no , they were not killed , the houses were old and i think they broke down , but the owner is still alive .
and were those destroyed during the war ?
no , they broke down , because of poor maintenance , and caring less i think that is why they broke down
bad things happened in this place , people were killed from here , when you reach here after the genocide what does it mean to you ?
i rarely pass here , but nearby there is a short cut when i pass there , i always remember that we were once here , even in my conversations am always talking about it because i will never forget , we saw things that were not good , scary and sad things , and that is why i can not forget no matter what .
people who were killed from here , where are they buried now ? what happened after the genocide ?
down the road at the bus stop sign , seven people were killed from there , they were killed by interahamwe , those interahamwe killed them using guns , they buried them below the tarmac road , there was a house before but it is now empty land , there is a tailor shop but one can clearly see that there was an empty land .
how were those seven people killed ?
those people were shot , they were shot since many had guns , they were killed by more than ten interahamwe .
that place is at the roadside , when you pass the place walking or in a bus what do you feel ?
when we pass here , having stayed here for a long time , we still like passing here , when we reach here i emmediatly ... especially when i am with someone i emmediatly tell them that i lost my relatives , friends and parents here , and thus i can never forget .
personally do you feel that other people should also know about it even though it happened at the roadside ?
how were these people killed ? were they shot dead ? did the perpetrators throw them alive into the pit ?
the perpetrators brought them alive to the pit , killed them and then threw them in . some were even thrown in alive ! for example , my older brother was thrown in alive . he spent 2 days agonizing and begging for drinking water ! the perpetrators cut up his arm and threw him in mocking him and saying he should bury himself .
what about the others ? did they shoot them or did they use clubs to kill them ?
about how many people were thrown in here ?
i believe that as a survivor and as somebody who lives in this cell of byimana , you know something about the people who were dumping people into the pits . i 'd like you to tell us about them if possible .
they were killed here in rubirizi . there was even a veterinary who was hiding with my brother . we will ask him because he saw him being taken away to be killed .
are you talking about damascene ?
no , he is called rwagapfizi .
rwagapfizi ...
yes , in those houses over there , the houses that belong to the diary . that 's where he was working .
if we agree that people were brought in pick ups ... were they accompanied by soldiers who shot them afterwards ?
the interahamwes were mixed with soldiers . they all came from kanombe and were armed with grenades , guns , machetes , cudgels ... not the ones you sae , check on the other side . there are others there ! yes ! human beings !
do you know a certain ndiramiye ?
ndiramiye ?
...
but i know gacaca will let us know . there was a big road here ; the killers would put the victims together and whenever they reached a big number , they took them over there . the victims were already dead by the time they got there .
there were big roads here . the perpetrators were bringing them , killing then and then use a different road to go home since they were so many of them . they were chasing all over ! they ... there were even trucks that brought corpses here from samuduha . there 's a man called gafaranga who told me that drivers from the minitrap [ ministry of transportation ] put corpses into the trucks and then came to throw them here at rubirizi .
how were the victims killed ?
obviously , if there was a big number of victims , that means the perpetrators were many as well . i 'd like to ask you if you know some of the people who participated in those acts ... maybe they 're free ... ?
free ... most of them are no longer free . those perpetrators were members of cdr and mrnd [ political parties ] . people like idi , kabagabo whom i told you about were driving their cars , looting and looking around for other guys such as bizimungu , kagarara ... they had given themselves nicknames but we know their names and their families are still alive !
