Musharraf's Last Act?
General Musharraf appeared on the national scene on October 12, 1999, when he ousted an elected government and announced an ambitious "nation-building" project.
Many Pakistanis, disillusioned with Pakistan's political class, remained mute, thinking that he might deliver.
The September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on America brought Musharraf into the international limelight as he agreed to ditch the Taliban and support the United States-led war on terror.
Musharraf clamped down on some religious militants operating inside Pakistan and also on those fighting Indian forces in Kashmir.
As a result, Pakistan was rewarded with American financial assistance and arms.
In furtherance of his re-alignment, Musharraf sent the Pakistani army into the tribal areas bordering Afghanistan for the first time since Pakistan's independence.
Operations there against Taliban and al-Qaeda forces brought mixed results.
Although the US viewed Musharraf as an agent of change, he has never achieved domestic political legitimacy, and his policies were seen as rife with contradictions.
For example, he made alliances with Islamist political forces (who in 2004 voted for constitutional changes legitimizing his position and actions).
At the same time, he sidelined moderate, mainstream political leaders while claiming that he stood for "enlightened moderation."
A series of ill-planned military operations in the tribal areas further complicated the situation in the volatile border region.
Last March, Musharraf took his boldest step, removing the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Iftikhar Chaudhry.
To the surprise of many, the country's legal community organized a nation-wide movement to restore the Chief Justice to his post.
Hundreds of thousands of ordinary people demanded the rule of law and the supremacy of the constitution, emboldening the judiciary and changing the country's political dynamic.
In a historic ruling that Musharraf had little choice but to accept, the Supreme Court itself reinstated the Chief Justice in July.
Subsequently, the energized judiciary continued ruling against government decisions, embarrassing the government -- especially its intelligence agencies.
Government officials were held accountable for actions that were usually beyond the reach of the law, ranging from brutal beatings of journalists, to illegal confinement for "national security."
Musharraf and his political allies tried to adjust to this new reality, but their patience ran out when the Supreme Court took up petitions against Musharraf's decision to run for president.
According to the constitution (originally promulgated in 1973 by an elected parliament), a serving military official cannot run for an elected office.
Musharraf was not ready to give up his military post, but also wanted to be a civilian president.
While he announced that he would leave his military position "if" he was elected president, his track record of reneging on his promises haunted the judiciary.
The proceedings of the court over the last few weeks made Musharraf jittery.
The decision of the 11-member bench might easily have gone against him.
Legally cornered, Musharraf has now decided to abandon constitutionality, removing the leading judges of the Supreme Court and provincial high courts and putting curbs on the media.
Lawyers, human rights activists, and political leaders have since been arrested.
There is widespread public resentment in response to these moves.
Rather than taking responsibility for the deteriorating security situation (as evidenced by regular suicide bomb attacks) and the increasing Talibanization of the tribal areas, Musharraf has tried to blame the judiciary and media.
To be sure, in some cases, judicial activism was obvious (though within the realm of constitutional law), and the media also made mistakes; but by no stretch of the imagination can these be linked to religious extremism or support for militancy.
It is unlikely that Musharraf's latest gambit will succeed, as his popular support is at its lowest ebb.
Pakistan's armed forces -- repeated targets of suicide bombers -- have become demoralized.
It is difficult to imagine them standing with Musharraf should civil conflict erupt.
Nor can a weak, embattled, and disoriented Musharraf be expected to fight Islamic militancy effectively or bring political stability to Pakistan.
Opposition political parties are drawing closer together, and former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, despite progress in her power-sharing negotiations with Musharraf, has strongly condemned his actions.
Human rights bodies, media associations, and lawyers' organizations are expected to defy the emergency, which will pit them against the security forces.
Terrorists may also benefit by attacking a preoccupied army and political forces aligned with Musharraf.
In the event of sustained protests and potential violence, top military commanders may decide to send Musharraf home -- a decision that would not be unprecedented in Pakistan's chronically turbulent history.
The Making of a Murder in Pakistan
Instead, Bhutto had to pay with her life for courageously challenging extremists of all stripes -- from Al-Qaeda and Taliban to the country's religious political parties and military hardliners.
As heir to Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the legendary democratic leader who was hanged by General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq's government in 1979, Benazir emerged as a symbol of resistance at a young age -- but languished in jails and exile in the 1980's.
Z. A. Bhutto's legacy was empowerment of the impoverished and defense of ordinary people's rights amid feudalistic politics and military rule.
Rather than bowing to the military junta, he embraced the gallows.
Hours before his hanging, Benazir was allowed to see her father for the last time, writing in her autobiography: "I told him on my oath in his death cell, I would carry on his work." She largely lived up to the promise.
Her first stint as prime minister (1988-90) was brief and disorganized.
Lt. Gen. Hamid Gul, the former Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) chief, confirmed that he sponsored an alliance of right-wing political parties to stop her from getting a parliamentary majority.
Information about Pakistan's nuclear program and ISI operations in Afghanistan were out of her domain.
Her second term in office (1993-96) was longer and better, but her government again fell early, owing to charges of mismanagement and corruption.
In reality, machinations by the intelligence agencies also played a part.
The military had developed an entrenched distrust of her, given her position as a popularly supported pro-Western leader who wanted peace with India.
After almost a decade in self-imposed exile, Bhutoo's return to Pakistan in October gave her a fresh political start.
Pakistan had changed, as military dictatorship and religious extremism in the north played havoc with the fabric of society.
A tentative arrangement with Musharraf, together with Western support -- particularly from the United Kingdom and the United States -- eased her return, which hundreds of thousands of people welcomed, though terrorists greeted her with a string of suicide bombings.
Bhutto's contacts with Mushararf's military government drew criticism, but she remained adamant that a return to democracy was possible only through a transition in which Musharraf would give up his military post, become a civilian head of state, and conduct free and fair elections.
To the dismay of some democratic forces, Bhutto stayed the course even after Musharraf imposed emergency rule on November 3 and removed the country's top judges to ensure his re-election.
Indeed, she even persuaded other important political leaders to participate in the planned January 8 election, which she viewed as an opportunity to challenge religious extremist forces in the public square.
She seized that opportunity by bravely traveling throughout the country, despite serious threats to her life, arguing for a democratic and pluralistic Pakistan.
One can understand why religious extremists like Al-Qaeda and Taliban would target her, and the government claims that it is impossible to defend against a suicide attack.
But Bhutto was reportedly killed by a sharp shooter before the terrorist blew himself up.
So, in the eyes of Pakistan's people, and especially of Bhutto's supporters, the intelligence services, either alone or in collaboration with extremists, finally decided to eliminate her.
Whether or not the government was involved, the fact remains that Pakistan has lost a desperately needed leader.
With Pakistan's future in the balance, the West's help and support will be crucial, but that means recognizing that Musharraf is not the only leader who can resolve Pakistan's myriad problems and manage the war on terror.
On the contrary, by nurturing the current environment of instability and uncertainty, Musharraf himself must be regarded as one of Pakistan's biggest problems.
Exorcising Musharraf's Ghost
Unlike Iraq and Afghanistan, democracy is not new to this 60-year-old state, but ethnic cleavages, weak institutions, and religious extremism in the North are perennially destabilizing.
And, while the new government settles in and establishes its priorities, the West, especially the United States, must reassess the impact of its past dealings with Pakistan.
Pakistan's new prime minister, Yousaf Gilani, is a seasoned politician and, more importantly, has Sufi family roots, which is a good omen because of the Sufi tradition of tolerance.
Gilani unequivocally declared in his inaugural address that fighting terrorism is a top priority, and his first decision was to release from house arrest judges deposed by Musharraf.
The respite from the horrendous spate of suicide bombings since the new government assumed power is similarly heartening.
But the honeymoon period is coming to an end.
Already, in Gilani's hometown of Multan, rioters attacked government offices and banks to protest electricity disruptions.
A couple of well-known opposition politicians, a chief minister and a federal cabinet minister of the previous pro-Musharraf government, were publicly thrashed, raising doubts about government control over law and order in the country.
So far, Musharraf has accepted his diminishing stature quietly -- though he has few other options.
The new political leadership, both inside and outside the parliament, has been carefully avoiding a head-on collision with the president.
Interestingly, in the midst of the political transition, Musharraf embarked on a week-long visit to China to lobby for construction of an oil and gas pipeline between China and the Persian Gulf that would be routed through Pakistan.
The deeper question raised by this proposal is whether Musharraf meant to convey a message to the US that Pakistan's priorities were shifting.
The revival of democratic politics in Pakistan will undoubtedly effect Pakistan-US relations.
Pakistan's military links with America appear to remain on a sound footing, so the strategic alliance with the US is likely to continue, perhaps with some nuanced differences over how to fight the "war on terror."
But Pakistani politicians are bound to be influenced by domestic public opinion, which is generally critical of US policies.
Nevertheless, long-term US interests in the region will be better served if Pakistan's democratic forces successfully establish themselves.
A proposal in the US Senate to increase development and education aid to Pakistan could help in winning the hearts and minds.
Meanwhile, President George W. Bush has said that "if another September 11-style attack is being planned, it probably is being plotted in Pakistan and not Afghanistan."
Whether this American intelligence assessment is based on credible information is unknown.
American election-year politics may also be behind this assertion.
But it is significant that Bush decided to voice this view during Pakistan's political transition.
Pakistan must take this view seriously, regardless of Bush's motivations.
The new government should quickly devise a policy to deal with terrorism.
Recent months have seen dozens of suicide bombings and other terrorist activities -- the price of Pakistan's own past blunders, as well as those of the West.
Afghanistan is a prime example, as is the failure to settle the Kashmir imbroglio with India.
Both failures have strengthened domestic terrorist groups.
Pakistan's government appears to be preparing to talk to some of the extremists in the tribal areas, introduce political reforms, and redouble development efforts.
But reference to "talks" makes the West uncomfortable.
American officials have likened this strategy to negotiating with terrorists, and point to a previous round of negotiations that did nothing to stop violence in the tribal areas.
But the new leadership wants to distinguish between al-Qaeda terrorists and religious conservatives and disillusioned Pashtun youth within Pakistan.
After all, the victory of the secular Awami National Party (ANP) in Pakistan's North-West Frontier Province is a strong indication that people there have rejected religious political forces and violence.
This window of opportunity can be expanded through dialogue and reconciliation with those who are ready to disavow extremism and militancy.
The new Pakistani government needs to explain this to the West in order to keep its support.
The US, meanwhile, should end direct military strikes in the area, even if these are conducted with the knowledge and cooperation of Pakistan's military.
Force has never worked with the Pashtun tribes, and there is no evidence that this has changed.
There are real signs that the new government is considered a credible partner in the tribal areas.
It needs to be given time to find a way out of the endless cycle of violence. 
Pervez Musharraf's Long Goodbye
The potential charges are serious: conspiring to destabilize the government that was elected last February, unlawfully removing the country's top judges in November 2007, and failing to provide adequate security to Benazir Bhutto before her assassination last December.
Allying himself with the Bush administration has increased his unpopularity, especially following missile attacks by the United States in Pakistan's tribal areas.
Despite earlier differences on how to deal with Musharraf, Pakistan's leading political parties are now united against him.
Feuding between the Pakistan People's Party, led by Benazir's widower, Asif Ali Zardari, and the Pakistan Muslim League (N), led by former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, had given Musharraf a chance to regain some standing after his allies were defeated in the February elections.
American reluctance to abandon Musharraf -- together with prolonged electricity shortages, which made the new government appear incompetent -- also raised his hopes.
Musharraf may be counting on the army, his primary constituency, to bail him out of this crisis.
Though such support remains a possibility, it is unlikely that the army leadership will extend itself on his behalf.
Though a protégé of Musharraf, the army's chief of staff, General Ashfaq Kayani, is a professional soldier for whom the army's institutional interests are more important than the political interests of his former army boss.
Kayani has repeatedly declared that the army will not interfere in political affairs, and that the parliament and constitution are supreme.
Even if the army is tempted to step in on Musharraf's behalf, it has been chastened by political developments during the past year.
The entire legal community arose to demand restoration of the country's judges and reinforcement of the rule of law.
The public's demand for free elections and the resulting creation of a democratic government have forced the military to accept the public will.
The army has also paid a heavy price for Musharraf's approach to the war on terror.
Suicide bombers have struck repeatedly at military installations and personnel around the army's headquarters in Rawalpindi.
An increase in deadly attacks on army convoys in the Pakistan-Afghanistan tribal areas has also pushed the army away from Musharraf.
Though the army has reaped a financial windfall from US military aid, and has targeted many foreign militants allied with al-Qaeda in the region, its performance against Pakistani militants has been mixed at best.
Consequently, the prestige of the Taliban and other militant groups operating in the area has grown.
In this context, the army, seeking to avoid sole responsibility for reverses, wants a popular government to take charge of policy.
No such government can emerge if the elected parties are unseated.
Nevertheless, there are signs of disagreement on important matters between the government and the army.
The military recently blocked a government move to place Pakistan's infamous intelligence service, the ISI, under the control of the interior minister rather than the prime minister.
Musharraf backed the military's opposition to this reform, gaining some gratitude from military commanders.
During Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani's recent visit to the US, President Bush repeatedly said that his administration supports Pakistan's democracy, a policy since reiterated by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice.
This indicates that the US will not back Musharraf in any confrontation between him and Pakistan's democratic forces.
Most Pakistanis hope so.
Musharraf must assess what will be his legacy.
Rather than trying to face down impeachment and prolonging the crisis, he should recognize that Pakistan cannot afford more instability, and that giving up honorably will bring him some respect.
For the sake of argument, even if Musharraf faces impeachment and by some stroke of luck is saved from being thrown out of office, his future will be bleak.
In March 2009, the current ruling coalition will gain more seats in the Senate, and the government would almost certainly try to impeach him again.
Moreover, any attempt by Musharraf to dislodge the government by using his constitutional authority would trigger another election, the results of which would not be much different from the vote in February.
It is time for Musharraf's friends in the West to press him to serve his country one last time, by avoiding confrontation with his country's democratic forces and calling it quits.
South Asia at War
Regional conflict, involving all of the region's states and increasing numbers of non-state actors, has produced large numbers of trained fighters, waiting for the call to glory.
Within both India and Pakistan, economic disparities and a sense of social injustice have created fertile ground for conflict.
The use and abuse of religious fervor, whether "jihadi" or "Hindu fundamentalist," are striking at the roots of communal harmony across South Asia.
Much of the current trouble can be traced to Afghanistan, whose tragedy could never have remained confined within its designated borders.
The dynamics of the region changed when the Afghan freedom fighters of 1980's were converted into "mujahidin" through a criminal enterprise in which both the West and the Muslim world happily participated.
Pakistan, always insecure about India, became the hub of this transformation.
The West thought it had moved on after the fall of the Soviet empire, but the region -- and increasingly the global community -- continues to pay a heavy price for this unholy project.
The ills of two decades in South Asia can be attributed to the Afghan jihad years: the rise of the Taliban, the dominance of Pakistani-sponsored religious fanatics within the Kashmir freedom movement, and the eventual spread of sectarian conflict within Pakistan.
In Afghanistan, Pakistan's military and intelligence agencies sought "strategic depth" against India.
Moreover, they wanted payback for India's role in supporting the revolt in the 1960's and 1970's that led to Bangladesh's independence from Pakistan.
India is not blameless here.
It was pursuing a two-pronged strategy -- making the argument that all was well in Kashmir (a blatant lie) and supporting ethnic confrontation in Pakistan.
Violent intelligence wars between Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) and India's Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) have become a brutal reality in South Asia.
Lashkar-e-Taiba (LET, Army of the Pure), a Pakistan-based militant outfit supporting insurgency on the Indian side of Kashmir, was a product of these years.
According to Indian investigators, this group is implicated in the Mumbai attacks.
Pakistan's clampdown on its offices throughout the country essentially confirms this conclusion, though Pakistan is publicly demanding more evidence.
LET was the armed wing of an Ahle-Hadith organization, a South Asian version of Saudi-style fundamentalism, whose purpose was to hit Indian forces in Kashmir.
Though the group was banned by former Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf after the terrorist attacks on the United States of September 11, 2001, some of its operators went underground and others joined Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD, Party of Proselytizing) -- an organization that runs religious educational centers and charities.
Given its established linkages with Pakistan's intelligence outfits, the group was never targeted strongly.
In fact, it was even involved in rescue operations on the Pakistani side of Kashmir after the devastating 2005 earthquake there.
What Pakistan's military strategists failed to realize was that groups like LET and JuD had local agendas as well -- converting Pakistan into a theocracy.
Hafiz Saeed, the founder of LET and currently the head of JuD, once proudly argued that: "We believe in the Clash of Civilizations, and our Jihad will continue until Islam becomes the dominant religion."
JuD, along with many other like-minded groups, radicalized thousands of young Pakistanis.
Through its web and print publications, it also routinely challenged the teachings of the Sufi mystics who originally brought Islam to South Asia by promoting pluralism and love for humanity.
Even while demanding strong action against JuD, India must recognize that Pakistan is itself a victim of terror.
Any military confrontation with Pakistan will only empower Pakistani radicals.
India also needs to look inward, as anti-Muslim violence in Gujarat and the activities of Hindu fundamentalist groups have potentially created recruitment opportunities for Muslim extremists within India.
An amicable resolution of the Kashmir conflict will only help improve peace prospects in South Asia.
For Pakistan, a concerted and sustained effort against all extremist groups operating in the country is necessary.
Militants of all stripes must be decommissioned completely and transparently.
Equally important for Pakistan is to expand and reform its public education system and improve basic services so that radical groups cannot lure young people into their educational and welfare networks.
Otherwise, the status quo can gravely threaten Pakistan's -- and South Asia's -- future.
Syria's Culture of Fear and Stalemate
It is not surprising that the new, young leader of an Arab country should be tremendously concerned, during his first years in office, with establishing his legitimacy and stature.
In replacing his father, the late President Hafiz al-Assad, Syria's current President, Bashar al-Assad, urgently needed to demonstrate his command of his country's situation even more than other relatively new Arab leaders, such as Jordan's King Abdullah or Morocco's King Muhammad.
For Bashar al-Assad selection as the replacement for his father, within minutes of Assad's death on June 10, 2000, had stunned Syria's entire system, despite the years of preparing public opinion for this succession.
Having failed to put forward a clear and effective program of internal reform, the young President sought to make up for his domestic failure in the realm of foreign affairs.
Here, no surprise, the ongoing Arab-Israeli conflict provided the most visible opportunity to establish his leadership credentials, especially in the aftermath of the democratic election of Ariel Sharon as Israel's new Prime Minister, a man reviled in the Arab world.
During the recent Arab Summit in Beirut, the young President capitalized on the absence of the Egyptian, Libyan and Palestinian leaders (among others) to strike a positive chord with audiences in Syria and across the Arab world.
In a well-rehearsed, self-assured manner reminiscent of his late father, Bashar al-Assad aimed a provocative lecture at his colleagues, supporting the Palestinians' "right of resistance," calling upon Arab countries to sever their relations with Israel, urging an Iraqi-Kuwaiti reconciliation, and endorsing Saudi Crown Prince Abdallah's peace initiative.
With these demands, the young President emerged in many Syrian eyes as the summit's "Man of the Hour," a leader with a deep understanding of the issues at hand.
Through his confident performance, the new President gained in stature.
More importantly, his performance deflected attention from any consideration of economic or political reform within Syria, at least for now.
Initially, President Bashar's accession to power was accompanied by a modest, but noticeable political thaw.
Popular forums and private discussion clubs sprung up across Syria, allowing relatively open debate.
After a few months, these popular forums were brought to an abrupt halt, as security services enforced a stringent set of regulations that effectively closed these open gatherings.
The shortness of this Syrian "spring" came as a hard blow to the expectations of many of the country's intellectuals and professionals, young and old.
This blow was felt all the more sharply as it became obvious that curtailment of these popular forums did not stir a wide public reaction.
Forced to recognize the prospect of being marginalized yet again by the new government, Syrian intellectuals turned their attention to Sharon and the growing conflict between Israelis and Palestinians.
Once again, the Palestinian cause became a substitute for focused attention on Syria's domestic situation, offering Syrian intellectuals and professionals a politically safe way to vent their frustrations.
As for the Syrian "Street," that amorphous mixture of average citizens and popular consensus, not only did it lack any sympathy for the intellectuals, it also failed to show any systematic interest in domestic politics.
The main concerns of the average Syrian, it seems, are definite improvements in living standards and a reduction in the high unemployment rate.
Broader concerns about reform - civil law, women's rights, and the role of religion in society - remain issues that the Syrian Street prefers to avoid.
For better or worse, restrictions in these areas are well-understood constants of Syrian life.
Challenging them in difficult and insecure times is not an appealing prospect.
The passivity of Syrian society is the result of a tacit agreement between people and government.
The government does not dabble too much in social affairs, while the people do not involve themselves too much in internal politics.
Meanwhile, the Arab-Israeli conflict serves as a mutually agreed upon rallying point for Syria's government and governed.
As the pretext for ignoring the repression of basic freedoms, that conflict has come to be described in powerful national and religious rhetoric throughout Syrian society.
What might otherwise be seen as a political conflict has acquired significant socio-cultural dimensions.
It is therefore legitimate to wonder whether Syria's President can act with any real initiative toward the Arab-Israeli conflict.
Despite the dictatorial nature of his regime, President al-Assad still needs to satisfy popular sentiment regarding Israel.
To betray this consensus runs the risk of mobilizing people on behalf of other, more domestically-oriented concerns.
This is the risk of all popular mobilization in the Middle East; Syria simply exhibits a more potent version of it.
Cradle of Contradictions
The American-led invasion of Iraq was supposed to begin a process of transformation across the Middle East. Syrian poet and political analyst Ammar Abdulhamid suggests that a thaw - if not quite change, then perhaps its precursor - is now occurring in Syria.
Life in Syria has never been simple.
The realities, meticulously hidden under a veneer of homogeneity, have always been too complex for even the most discerning of scholars.
The peaceful coexistence between the country's myriad ethnic, religious, and tribal groups is the result of a complex layer of concessions, compromises, tacit agreements, and other pragmatic arrangements perfected over the centuries.
Over the last few months, life has become even more complex, as both the country's ruling elite and civil society advocates seem more bewildered than ever about the country's future.
Each group is focused on determining its particular privileges while preserving the territorial integrity and national unity of a country growing increasingly fractious and fragile.
These developments, of course, follow from the US-led invasion of Iraq, which turned a vague and distant threat into an imposing neighbor whose intentions towards Syria's Baathist regime are anything but friendly.
Consequently, the need for drastic change in the structure and style of a previously reality-impaired regime has finally begun to sink in.
As a result, Syria's various political power centers have embarked on a desperate search for a vision to promote change yet allow the existing order to survive.
Because Syria's rulers have neither the ability nor the know-how to produce such a vision, civil society has been granted some leeway for action.
Clearly, this expansion of civil society's operating arena may even turn into open opposition to Syria's rulers.
The point is to allow for some debate to take place in the hope of producing the sorely needed vision of change.
This will give the outside world the impression that serious change is taking place and that the regime should be given the time to see it through.
Crackdowns, detentions, and illegal trials thus exist hand in hand with a growing tolerance for creative initiatives.
Over twenty NGOs have been formed in the last few months.
Many are charities and often include on their advisory boards one or two members with clear government connections (the daughter of a minister or an army general, or, in a couple of notable instances, the President's wife).
Even so, this development is still significant by Syrian standards, as independent initiatives are traditionally frowned upon.
Of real significance here is the press service, All4Syria (www.all4syria.org), created by the Syrian engineer Ayman Abdul Nour.
The service contains an electronic newsletter that includes Syria-related reports and articles gathered from a variety of sources, often including comments by opposition figures at home and abroad.
In its way, All4Syria has provided an indirect conduit for dialogue between government and opposition, which may not have taken place otherwise.
Although All4Syria's Internet site was recently blocked for unspecified reasons, the newsletter continues to be circulated and Mr. Abdul Nour moves in his usual circles unmolested.
I have been involved with the launch of another initiative, the Tharwa Project (www.tharwaproject.com), which I have long envisioned as one way for the Arab region to address its problems with religious and ethnic minorities.
Although regional in scope and with a colorful international board of advisors, the Tharwa Project (Tharwa means wealth in Arabic) is based in Damascus and will be run from there.
The launch of the Tharwa Project one month ago inadvertently coincided with Kurdish riots that rocked northern Syria.
This, together with the prominence of the advisory board (which includes well-known Egyptian sociologist Saad Eddin Ibrahim, French expert on political Islam Gilles Kepel, and Flynt Leverett, a Brookings Institution Fellow) and the sensitivity of minority rights in general, combined to give the Project national, regional, and international notice.
So far, Syria's authorities have not reacted to the Tharwa Project.
It's probably still too early in the game for that.
But the Project seems to represent the type of activity that can help produce visions for change.
Some in the Syrian government could be aware of this.
Nevertheless, fourteen civil society activists who attempted to organize a special meeting to address the realities of the Kurdish issue in Syria recently received various sentences on charges of working to undermine national unity.
The authorities clearly wish to control the extent of the thaw in Syria's political culture.
But even as such crackdowns continue, more private independent initiatives are bubbling to the surface.
For my colleagues and me, this is the time for hard and continuous work to expand the space of popular participation in the country and region.
We can deliver no judgment at this stage as to where things might be heading.
Everything and anything seems possible.
Still, it is tempting to think that Syria is witnessing a new beginning, and the end of an era whose sins we all bear.
Is Dialogue with Iran and Syria Worth It?
Advocates of the Iraq war lacked an understanding of the complexities on the ground to wage an effective war of liberation and democratization.
As a result, their policies merely ended up eliminating Iran's two major regional rivals: the Taliban and Saddam Hussein's regime.
This presented Iran with a golden opportunity to project itself as a regional hegemon, and Iran's leaders are unlikely to let this opportunity slip away.
Advocates of dialogue with the Iranians and their Syrian allies, like former United States Secretary of State James Baker, labor under the delusion that they can actually reach an understanding that can enable a graceful US exit from Iraq and help stabilize that wounded country.
The delusion is based on two false assumptions: that the Iranians and the Syrians can succeed in Iraq where the US has failed, and that the international community can afford to pay the price of ensuring their cooperation.
True, Syria and Iran are playing a major role in supporting Iraqi insurgents, and Syria is still encouraging the trafficking of jihadists and weapons across its borders with Iraq.
But the idea that these activities can be halted at will is naïve.
For one thing, the interests of the Shia communities in Iraq and Iran are not the same.
Iraqi Shia have never accepted Iranian dictates, and many took part in Saddam's war against Iran in the 1980's.
After all, the Iraqi Shia are Arabs, and if they are now willing to coordinate their activities with their Persian counterparts, their main goal will always be to secure an independent course as soon as possible, even while they carry on with their internecine disputes within Iraq.
Iran is in no better position than the US to convince them to resolve their differences.
President Basher al-Assad of Syria faces a similar dilemma.
Although he has opened Syria's border to jihadists and has allowed Saddam's supporters to operate freely there, that choice may not be entirely his.
Syria's aid to Saddam in maneuvering around the United Nations' oil-for food program brought Iraqi money to inhabitants of the border region, who have always been closer in customs, dialect, and outlook to their Iraqi neighbors than to their fellow Syrians.
In the absence of government investment, local inhabitants' loyalty went to Iraqi Baathists who helped improve their lot.
Indeed, even local security apparatuses have been unwilling to comply with dictates from Assad and his clique to seal the borders.
In these cirumstances, neither Syria nor Iran seems capable of delivering anything but mayhem in Iraq.
What, then, would the proposed dialogue between the US and these states achieve other than continue to empower their corrupt yet ambitious regimes?
The story gets more complicated when one considers the UN inquiry into the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri.
Assad wants nothing more than to see this affair forgotten -- and the proponents of dialogue think that they can give him what he wants in the hope of breaking Syria's alliance with Iran.
But that is merely another erroneous (not to mention amoral) assumption.
The alliance between Syria and Iran dates back more than two decades, and was explicitly reaffirmed by the two ruling regimes as recently as January 2005.
Indeed, the two regimes are now joined at the hip.
Assad's recent refusal to attend a summit in Tehran with his Iranian and Iraqi counterparts was a mere tactical move designed to appeal to the proponents of dialogue.
In fact, Iran has invested hundreds of millions of dollars in Syria, and annual bilateral trade tops a billion dollars.
Irani's growing influence over the Syrian security apparatus is well established, and Iran is funding an effort to create Syrian Shia militias to compensate for Assad's sagging support in the army and in the minority Alawite community.
Assad cannot turn his back on all of this.
No deal would be sweet enough, even if it included the return of the Golan Heights.
For Assad and his supporters, survival is more important than sovereignty.
Still, to read the well-known names of commentators and policymakers who are recommending engaging Syria and/or Iran is a testament to how inconsequential and cut off the Western powers have become from the realities on the ground in the world's most turbulent region.
That, it seems, is the price of their arrogance.
Defending America's "Freedom Agenda"
Coming close on the heels of the Annapolis conference, which brought together representatives from all Arab states -- including Syria -- and Israel, many observers regarded our meeting as a signal of the Bush administration's refusal to normalize bilateral relations with Syria or strike any deals or bargains with its regime.
Indeed, these views may not be far off the mark.
For, while talking to us, Bush did not try to mask his disdain for Syria's rulers, and he rejected the possibility of direct talks or any improvement in relations.
As such, the "positive body language" that Syria's ambassador to the United States, Emad Moustapha, said he detected during his brief encounter with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice during the Annapolis meeting was outweighed by Bush's negative verbal language during our meeting.
And we all know where the buck stops.
For our part, we underscored the worsening human rights situation in Syria.
Indeed, no sooner did our meeting finish, and with the world commemorating International Human Rights Day, the Syrian regime launched a massive campaign of arrests and intimidation directed against some of the country's most prominent dissidents.
Though many were freed within hours, some remain in jail.
This episode also highlights the need for continued emphasis on human rights and democracy promotion.
America's "freedom agenda" is not the cause of its current travails in the Middle East.
The problem has been a lack of consistency in promoting the agenda, failure to develop broader international support for it, and the behavior of the US itself, which has presented it as a martial plan, rather than a Marshall Plan.
Whatever the cause of these shortcomings, the lesson that US and Europe policymakers should draw is that the objective -- facilitating democratization and modernization -- remains valid, despite the need for a change in tactics.
Abandoning the freedom agenda would reaffirm the still-popular notion that all the US really cares about in the Middle East is oil and Israeli security, at the expense of everything else, including regional development and the well-being of the Arab and Muslim peoples.
This conviction continues to facilitate recruitment by extremist groups, and must be countered effectively to prevent the emergence of new fronts in the war on terror.
True, a freedom agenda will not change people's attitudes overnight, but if pursued consistently, over time, with bipartisan support in the US -- and more constant support in Europe -- it will have a chance to make serious headway. 
There are many "if's" here, but pro-democracy activists can only live on hope, or, as the late Syrian playwright Saadallah Wannous put it, they are condemned to hope.
Despite Bush's mixed record, he still seems to share this hope.
Will the same be true of America's next president?
Gaza's Crushed Childhoods

Ayman works very hard in school and dreams of a future career. But, with 47 students in his cramped classroom and double shifts the norm, his learning environment is very stressful. Home is no refuge: the recent incursion into Jabalia was 200 meters from where Ayman lives. The shooting and shelling so terrorized his five-year-old sister that she still wakes up screaming at night.

Ayman's experience is all too familiar in Gaza's crowded, crippled neighborhoods, where those who are least to blame for the troubles are suffering the most.
Indeed, among Gaza's 840,000 children -- of which 588,000 are refugees -- Ayman's story is luckier than many. Since the recent escalation of violence that began last month, at least 33 Palestinian boys and girls have been killed and many more injured or maimed -- caught in the crossfire, shot in their living rooms, or struck by explosions in their own backyards. On February 28, four children playing soccer were hit by a missile, which dismembered them so completely their own families could not identify their bodies.
Ayman, his siblings, and all Gaza's children are finding their lives diminished each day -- a cruel, slow suffocation of their spirit and their dreams.
Instead of enjoying expanding horizons, they are trapped in a virtual prison, where things that every child should be able to take for granted are instead being taken away: the right to play, to go to school, to have enough to eat, to have light to study by at night, and to feel safe in their own homes.
The weight of one of the world's longest-running conflicts is resting on their thin shoulders, crushing their childhood and inflicting psychological scars that may never heal.
Palestinians were once reputed to be among the best-educated people in the Middle East; today, after years of violence, isolation, and poverty, their proud tradition of educational excellence has been shattered.
Almost 2,000 children in Gaza have dropped out of school in the last five months.
Those who remain must share tattered textbooks and do without crucial resources.
The January 2008 semester exams at schools in Gaza operated by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) found 50-60% failure rates in mathematics and a 40% failure rate in Arabic -- the children's native language. Despite this, Ayman insists, "I want to be an educated person. I want to be an engineer to build my country."

Let the world recall that Gaza's crisis is a manmade disaster. And let the world take note that conditions are worse today than at any time since the occupation began. Seventy-nine percent of Gaza's households live in poverty; eight out of ten depend on food assistance.
Almost half the labor force is unemployed; local industry has collapsed.
Water and sewage systems are failing; garbage is piling up in the streets.
UNICEF is working around the clock to restore a sense of normalcy for Gaza's youth -- developing remedial worksheets to help children keep up with their studies; creating sports and recreation programs in schools; and working with communities to establish play areas where kids can be kids in safety.
UNICEF works with partners to get water, hygiene, and medical supplies to households and health facilities.
And UNICEF-supported counseling teams are spread across the area, helping Palestinian parents and children cope with the burden of stress.
But, while UNICEF is doing all it can to comfort those in the midst of Gaza's madness, only political leaders can bring the dreadful nightmare to an end. It is time for new engagement. The siege must be lifted.
The killing of civilians has to stop, on both sides.
Palestinian and Israeli children deserve to grow up in peace. And leaders on both sides, supported by the international community, must join in the kind of honest dialogue that is the only viable path toward achieving it.
Ayman's father quietly says, "My children are my hope." The children of Gaza are a light in the darkness. They deserve a chance to shine.
Europe's Second Chance in the Balkans
The decision on Kosovo may not imply the prospect of renewed large-scale conflict, but it does raise serious questions for Europe's relations with Russia and the United States, as well as for stability throughout the Balkans.
While the US has a major stake in the outcome, EU countries obviously have the most significant interests in the region, and perhaps this time they will assume a corresponding leadership role.
For at least the next two months, the United Nations Security Council will debate a blueprint for Kosovo's future, arduously worked out during a year of "negotiations" between the governments in Belgrade and Pristina by UN envoy and former Finnish president Martti Ahtisaari.
The bluebrint provides for Kosovo's "supervised independence," maximum protection for Serb and other minorities, and a supervisory role for the EU.
Ahtisaari's proposal is an acknowledgement that no agreement between the parties is possible, and that there is no constructive alternative to Kosovo's independence.
Together with the US, the EU collectively has rallied around the Ahtisaari proposal.
But individually, a number of European countries -- Spain, Greece, Italy, Cyprus, Romania, Slovakia, and Austria -- are skeptical or negative toward Kosovo independence, which raises profound questions about the EU's resolve.
Meanwhile, Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica is waging a tireless and remarkably effective diplomatic campaign denouncing both Ahtisaari and his proposal.
He has strengthened the position of many in Europe and elsewhere who are skeptical of challenging a country's territorial integrity or who still claim to believe in a negotiated settlement.
More worrisome is the current uncertainty about whether a shaky Europe will stand up to Russia, upon which Serbia depends to maintain sovereignty over Kosovo.
So far, the Kremlin has resolutely stated that it will accept only a settlement agreed to by both parties, in effect endorsing Serbia's position.
While conveying the possibility of a veto, Russia's current strategy is to delay a Security Council vote as long as possible by prompting a new fact-finding mission to Kosovo, which will most likely be followed by renewed insistence on another effort to negotiate a settlement.
Serbia welcomes delay in the hope that this will stimulate violence by frustrated Kosovars, thereby increasing Europe's opposition to independence and bolstering Serbia's dedication to maintaining the status quo, or, as a last resort, to partitioning Kosovo.
Some European countries apparently believe that they can maintain an EU consensus in support of Ahtisaari's plan but allow Russian foot-dragging on the grounds that delay is not unreasonable and something better may turn up with additional negotiations.
But, by adopting such a stance, they thwart their own envoy and may well stimulate the violence they profess to abhor.
History offers little consolation.
The EU's handling of relations with Serbia in the past only encouraged intransigence.
Instead of repeatedly making clear that Kosovo independence is an indispensable requirement for EU membership -- so important to Serbia's modernization and Balkan stability -- EU leaders like Javier Solana laud Kostunica as a great democratic leader.
They relentlessly but unsuccessfully pressured Montenegro's leaders to remain in a dysfunctional union with Serbia, condoned Kostunica's dubious 2006 referendum on a new constitution enshrining Kosovo as a part of Serbia, and weakened demands for Serbia's cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal in The Hague.
Realizing Ahtisaari's proposal will depend on EU solidarity and persistence, coupled with strong American support, to manage the vicissitudes of UN debate, lobby skeptical non-permanent Security Council members, such as Indonesia and South Africa, and persuade Russia to abstain rather than exercise its veto.
Many believe that Russia will not risk its relations with Europe and the US, ultimately abstaining if Western countries hold firm.
But Russia appears to be in a Gaullist mood, and has other outstanding issues causing friction with the US and Europe.
Putin's Russia is not Yeltsin's Russia, when the West could simply shunt aside Russian concerns.
Europe is vulnerable on many fronts, particularly in view of its dependence on Russian energy, while America's weakened presidency has diminished US influence in Russia.
If Russia does veto the Ahtisaari plan, the EU's united facade will likely fracture, with many European countries refusing either to join the US in recognizing an independent Kosovo without the UN's blessing or to send a supervisory mission there.
That would open a new and tumultuous era in the Balkans, with more than Kosovo at stake.
Indeed, with the UN and the Western alliance in disarray, the region could fall victim to further Russian policy mischief.
Putin's Balkan Mischief
At every turn, Russia has challenged Western efforts to facilitate Kosovo's independence.  After a year of negotiations between Serbia and Kosovo, President Vladimir Putin's Kremlin rejected the UN mediator's report recommending supervised independence, prevented the Security Council from accepting that report, and insisted on three additional months of negotiations between Serbia and Kosovo -- even after compromise became impossible.
Three weeks ago in the UN Security Council, Russia again insisted that any agreement required the approval of both Serbia and Kosovo, and that further negotiations were necessary.
Russia knows that such negotiations will be fruitless, but believes that another seemingly innocent appeal for more talks would strain EU unity, which appears to be a vital goal for Putin.
Further delay might also generate violence in Kosovo and undermine international support for independence.
Putin's hatred of the Yeltsin era's "subservient" relations with the West fuels his opposition.
But the West's delay in resolving Kosovo's status permitted that opposition to gain traction.
Indeed, the West has consistently misread Russia's intentions on Kosovo.
Many claimed that the Kremlin was delaying the inevitable but ultimately would not block independence.
Now, at the eleventh hour, Russia is sticking to its obstructionist position, and its presidential election in March will likely reinforce anti-Western postures.
So what will Putin do when the United States and most European Union members recognize an independent Kosovo in the coming months without a UN blessing, as they now plan?
It is unlikely that the Kremlin would attempt another military intervention in Kosovo (their effort in 1999 to land troops at Pristina airport was a fiasco), but it has a range of options that must give the West pause.
Kremlin support has made Serbia's nationalist intransigence over Kosovo effective.
Russia has said that it will not give Serbia a blank check, but it will likely support the Serbian government's efforts to isolate and destabilize an independent Kosovo.
While Serbia has resisted partition of Kosovo, Russia would also support a Serbian proposal to partition the Serb-populated north, an effort that would open up a Pandora's box of possible partition of Serbia, Bosnia, and Macedonia.
Such a proposal could get some support in Europe and elsewhere as a seemingly appropriate compromise, even if it would destabilize the Balkans once more.
Russia will certainly continue its diplomatic efforts to persuade the world that negotiations are the only way to solve the problem, and that it cannot be solved outside the UN.
That will attract support among many UN members, including those that have major dissatisfied ethnic minorities.
Russia could also react beyond the Balkans, most obviously in the Caucasus, with its breakaway regions, particularly in Georgia.
A declaration of independence by Kosovo will likely bring a similar declaration from Georgia's breakaway Abkhazia region, which Russia could well recognize.
If Georgia takes military steps to prevent that, Russia's military would likely react with force, creating a situation that could get out of control.
While the US and the EU do not want to worsen relations with Russia, they cannot retreat in the face of Russian obduracy; security in Europe is at stake.
But they must also continue to try to preempt confrontation with Russia on all fronts.
The West should make clear to Serbia that it will react vigorously against any efforts to promote violence or partition Kosovo.
Dispatching additional NATO troops, in addition to the planned EU mission, to supervise Kosovo independence would be helpful.
Putin's Russia, which pays little attention to the rule of law, cloaks its diplomatic effort in the guise of adherence to international law, in particular UN Security Council resolution 1244, which ended the 1999 Kosovo war.
A long overdue diplomatic offensive needs to be launched to undercut Russian arguments as well as remind the world of what happened in Kosovo.
Resolution 1244 does not state that Kosovo must remain under Serb sovereignty, as Russia and Serbia insist, nor does it preclude independence.
Indeed, any reasonable reading of the resolution -- especially in the context of the conflict-ridden Balkans over the past two decades -- would acknowledge that independence would satisfy the resolution's intent and the purpose of sustaining UN supervision of the province for the past eight years.  
In the case of Abkhazia, the West should reiterate the sui generis nature of Kosovo and highlight the tremendous efforts it has undertaken there since 1999.
The world must make clear that Russian military involvement in Abkhazia is unacceptable, while also restraining Georgia's government from reacting militarily to any provocation.
How Russia reacts to Western support of Kosovo's coming declaration of independence will test how far we have progressed since the Cold War.
Through careful management of Kosovo's independence process, and attentiveness to opportunities to improve relations with Russia, the West might mitigate the worst consequences of this confrontation.
Regardless, a new Cold War might just get a little colder.
American Gulag
Recently, the United States achieved the dubious honor of boasting the largest prison and jail population on earth.
It reached this zenith by surpassing cash-strapped Russia - long its only rival as a mass imprisonment society - after Russia released thousands of inmates so as to save money.
A few years earlier, as America rushed to lock up ever more of its population for ever-pettier offenses, the absolute size of its incarcerated population surpassed that of China - despite China's population being more than four times that of America.
According to research conducted by the British Home Office, America now incarcerates over one fifth of the world's total prisoners.
There is something bitterly ironic in this.
For America really is a land of liberty, a place where lives, often scarred by injustice elsewhere, can be remade.
How tragic, therefore, that over the past twenty years, the country's political leaders have so often decided to deal with many of the most noxious side-effects of poverty - from chronic drug use and the establishment of street drug markets, to hustling, to gang membership and the spraying of graffiti on public buildings - through a vast over-reliance on incarceration.
How doubly tragic that this has occurred in tandem with a political assault on the Great Society anti-poverty programs put in place during the 1960s; that the investments in infrastructure, public education, public healthcare and job training which might curtail crime more effectively are, instead, being replaced by massive public expenditures on building new prisons to incarcerate hundreds of thousands of low-level offenders.
With such vicious cycles of crime, punishment and dis-investment in poor communities it is no surprise that the prison population has expanded to such an extent.
The numbers buttressing this sprawling prison system are extraordinary.
Approximately two million Americans are now serving either prison or jail time, over one million of them for non-violent offenses (a preponderance of these either for drug use or low-level drug sales).
Per hundred thousand residents, the US has an incarceration rate over five times that of England, six times that of Canada, and seven times that of Germany.
Somewhere in the region of 10% of African American men in their twenties live behind bars.
In some states, where a single felony conviction is enough to bar the offender from ever being able to vote again, over one quarter of African American males are disenfranchised.
High levels of disenfranchisement in Florida likely played a critical role in the much-disputed electoral victory of President Bush.
Since 1980, a virtual ``prison industrial complex'' has arisen, with phenomenal rates of new-prison construction abetted by lucrative construction and prison-guard union lobbies.
Several states, including California, now spend more on prisons than they do on higher education.
Despite dramatically falling crime rates over the last ten years (which most criminologists attribute more to demography - there have simply been fewer young men of late - than incarceration), prison populations have continued to soar.
Much of that increase has more to do with public perceptions about supposed crime waves and ham-handed public and political responses to occasional headline-capturing murders, than any actual underlying crime rate.
As the actual number of truly heinous crimes has in fact fallen, increasingly it is small-time hoodlums, drug users, and mentally ill people who have been drawing long spells behind bars.
America today has five times as many prisoners as it did in 1980.
One of the most dismaying developments is the spread of so-called ``three-strikes-and-you're out'' laws.
California's version, passed by citizen referendum in 1993 and ratcheted into place by state legislators in 1994, provides for the life imprisonment of any criminal with two previous serious convictions who is found guilty of any third felony.
By the end of last year there were about 7,000 people serving life sentences in California under this law.
Many thousands of them are serving life for small-time ``Third Strikes'': minor drug crimes, car theft, petty fraud, burglary, and drunk driving (even graffiti spraying, to the tune of $400 damage, which has now been reclassified as a felony).
One such man is fifty-eight year old heroin addict Billy Ochoa, who is serving a staggering 326 years in a supermax (super maximum security) prison for $2,100 of welfare fraud.
Because he had been convicted of several burglaries over the previous decades, when Ochoa was caught making fraudulent applications for food stamps and emergency housing vouchers in Los Angeles, he was tried under the Three Strikes law and given sentences on thirteen separate counts to be served in one of the toughest, most secure prisons in America.
Ochoa's sentence, apart from its extravagant cruelty, may ultimately cost taxpayers as much as a million dollars.
In many high security American prisons, inmates are routinely kept in virtual isolation, fed in their cells, allowed out for only half an hour of exercise a day, sometimes denied a TV, a radio, or even decorations for their concrete walls - conditions which have been documented to drive many of them into states of serious psychosis.
How can things have come to this America?
Now is the time - with the world watching America fight to defend its values - for the worst excesses of its criminal justice system to be addressed.
It is a tragedy that a great democracy should have so ugly and vast a prison system corroding both its reputation and its polity.
Palestine's War of Generations
Yasir Arafat may be dead, but his Machiavellian strategies linger.
Ever protective of his position as sole leader of the Palestinian people, Arafat sought to block any means by which a potential rival could challenge him.
But in protecting his position, Arafat also blocked the appointment of a successor in his lifetime.
In the first weeks after Arafat's death, that seemed not to matter.
Mahmoud Abbas, Arafat's longtime deputy and the architect of the Oslo accords, quickly secured the backing of Fatah, the PLO's core body.
A seamless transition appeared possible.
But now Marwan Barghouti, Fatah's leader in the West Bank during the current Intifada, has decided to contest Abbas for the presidency of the Palestinian Authority (PA) from his Israeli jail cell.
Facing economic stagnation and what Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Ahmed Qurei calls "the anarchy of weapons," a succession struggle is the last thing Palestinians need.
Any new leader must spur the economy, enforce the rule of law, fight corruption, unify the PA's security agencies, and preserve public safety -- and he must do so quickly or lose authority.
Abbas (also known as Abu Mazen) represents the Old Guard of Palestinian politics.
But the Young Guard -- those who led the first Intifada (1987-1993), as well as those making their names in the current Intifada -- want a share of power.
Abbas will thus need to find support within this rising generation of nationalist leaders if he is to succeed.
Resolving this generational struggle peacefully will require democratic elections within Fatah for membership of both the Revolutionary Council and the Central Committee.
The Sixth Fatah Congress, the first in sixteen years, will take place in August 2005 and will seek to reconcile the conflict between the Old and Young Guard.
Unlike Arafat and his fellow exiles, Barghouti, the most prominent leader among the Young Guard, grew up under Israeli occupation, and was arrested and detained several times.
Barghouti's popularity also stems from his refusal from the beginning to take any office in Arafat's corrupt PA and its institutions.
Although he was elected to the Palestinian Legislative Council in 1996, Barghouti's reputation soared when the current Intifada began in September 2000.
His support for attacks against Israeli soldiers and settlers in the occupied territories, which he argues is legitimate under international law, has earned him immense popularity among Palestinians, but also a sentence of five life terms plus 40 years in an Israeli prison.
Whether he can be released from prison is now a source of intense speculation.
But Barghouti has begun speaking out from his jail cell on the political situation, and his presence is growing.
His decision to challenge Abbas means that the "secular" forces within the Palestinian movement may be divided at a time when rivals with a robust Islamic agenda -- principally Hamas and Islamic Jihad -- are challenging them.
Both Hamas and Islamic Jihad are highly disciplined organizations, exercising tight control over their political and military wings.
Although Hamas has been weakened by Israel's targeted assassinations of Sheik Ahmad Yassin and Abdel-Aziz Rantisi, it retains strong military capabilities and popular support ranging between 25-30%, making it the second leading faction in the West Bank and Gaza.
Hamas has declared that it will not nominate its own candidate for the PA presidency.
Hassan Yusuf, a Hamas leader who was recently released from an Israeli jail after 28 months of administrative internment, explained to Al-Jazeera that "if Hamas assumed the leadership at this time, it would be vilified and isolated by the international community, and then the people would suffer."
Although Hamas is boycotting the election, many Hamas sympathizers will vote for the candidate most committed to defending the Palestinians' core demands.
Here Hamas members are simply reiterating Arafat's views, which will continue to limit the concessions any new leader can make.
Arafat set forth a blueprint including an independent Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza, with East Jerusalem as its capital, and a fair and just solution to the refugee problem.
Changing leaders will in no way alter these conditions for making peace.
So the question is this: who will Palestinians, in particular the Hamas constituency, think is better able to secure these goals, Abbas or Barghouti?
That answer will most likely determine who will be the PA's next leader.
But in the end, Israel will also have to make a choice, because peace will require Israeli concessions, not just compromises from the Palestinians.
Israel must freeze its settlement activity in the West Bank and stop constructing its barrier wall on Palestinian territories.
Israel must also free Palestinian prisoners, remove all checkpoints between Palestinian villages and town, and redeploy its forces to positions held prior to September 28, 2000, in accordance with phase I of the Road Map.
Either Abbas or Barghouti would certainly meet such a demonstration of good faith with good faith of his own.
By contrast, Hamas has entered electoral politics only recently, but it is fresh from impressive victories in the recent municipal elections in the West Bank and Gaza.
It is therefore expected to perform strongly in the voting for the Legislative Council, particularly in the Gaza Strip.
None of this was acknowledged in Abbas's announcement of the election's postponement.
Abbas said that the decision came at the request of the Palestinian Central Election Commission, after the Commission declared that it could not meet the deadline, because the election law had not yet been approved.
The Commission says that it needs at least two months after the law's adoption to organize the vote.
Although the Legislative Council passed the election law in its third and final reading, Abbas rejected it, a decision that falls within his presidential prerogatives.
Abbas wants all the candidates to be included on national lists, which would allow for proportional representation of all major Palestinian factions and groups.
Originally, Abbas had reached an agreement with Hamas on a system according to which half the parliament's seats would be elected on a regional basis, and half by party list.
However, the final version of the law would have chosen two-thirds of the seats regionally.
Although the formula supported by Abbas would benefit all Palestinian political parities and groups, Hamas has its own agenda.
Hamas is said to believe that a regional system would work to its advantage, an assessment supported by the recent local elections, in which its voters were concentrated in particular areas.
Hamas has launched an intensive media campaign to appropriate the Israeli withdrawal as a victory of its "armed struggle."
The campaign and its themes reflect an internal fight for control of the Gaza Strip and other PA-administered territories, and stresses Hamas' determination not to be disarmed and to continue the "armed struggle" in the West Bank.
Hamas also revealed two "military secrets" during the evacuation.
The first is a new missile named Sajil, which has a range of 15 kilometers and can reach more Israeli towns and cities.
The second is the "Qassamits," young women who are engaged in combat training.
Hamas timed these revelations with the disengagement to create the impression that its intensifying military strategy had prevailed.
All of this is designed to reinforce one point: the Gaza withdrawal belongs to Hamas.
A survey published on a Web site associated with Hamas claimed credit for killing 54% of all the Israelis who died as a result of Palestinians' armed struggle, and this body count is Hamas's claim to success.
In these circumstances, who will administer the evacuated areas until elections are held?
How will tax revenues be divided between those who claim leadership of the resistance and those who claim exclusive legitimacy to govern?
These are not problems that can await resolution.
Someone must decide soon, for example, about the division of the land and the apartments to be built in what is already known as "Khalifa bin Zaid City," located on a former Israeli settlement in the Gaza Strip.
There is no answer yet to any of these questions.
Whereas Hamas has demanded establishment of a Palestinian administration to supervise the areas vacated by Israel, Abbas has rejected this, agreeing at most to a "monitoring committee" in which representatives of Hamas will participate.
In any case, there will be no "division of areas" until Israel withdraws completely and the ruins are cleared away.
Then the bitter political struggle will begin in advance of the elections.
No matter what happens the day after Israel's final Gaza disengagement, one cannot escape the fact that Hamas's military options have diminished greatly.
Construction of the separation wall on the West Bank has made it almost impossible for Hamas fighters to reach Israel proper.
In addition, after the reoccupation of the West Bank's cities in April 2002, Israel arrested about 7000 Palestinians who are allegedly associated with Hamas, Fatah, and other Palestinian groups.
Continued armed struggle by Hamas will not be easy.
Hamas knows this, and thus is focusing its attention on the Gaza disengagement, seeking to exploit this victory by demanding a share in the post-disengagement order.
It has agreed to participate, for the first time, in the election of the Palestinian Legislative Council, which is due in January 2006, and it is expected to win a large number of seats.
This would, of course, cement its central role in Palestinian politics -- and it would just as surely exacerbate the challenge facing Abbas.
The Hamas Earthquake
Hamas won 76 of 132 seats in the Palestinian Legislative Council, and can count on support from four independent deputies.
Overall, that's 60% of the seats in Parliament, won in nearly every district in the West Bank and Gaza.
Hamas entered electoral politics only recently, but its massive victory was preceded by wide success in municipal elections.
Hamas's political moment has come.
Under Palestinian law, Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian president, must now ask Hamas to form a new government.
For their part, Fatah officials seem unwilling to join a Hamas-led government.
Although Hamas has said that it would seek such a coalition, Fatah's humiliating defeat has left it with little credibility as a governing partner.
So far, Fatah's senior leaders have declared that they will be a loyal opposition in Parliament, leaving governmental responsibility to Hamas.
Instead, they will have to focus on rebuilding and reenergizing Fatah.
Hamas is well aware of the shock that its victory has produced.
If Fatah refuses to join a coalition, Hamas may opt for a government of independents and technocrats.
It is unlikely that Hamas will form a government composed of hardliners.
The political, security, and economic circumstances of the Palestinians require a government focused on solving problems, not ideological purity.
The most urgent challenge facing the new government is rampant lawlessness and anarchy throughout Palestinian society.
Murder, kidnapping, and extortion have reached record heights.
Armed individuals resort to kidnapping to get jobs, free family members from prison, and exact revenge.
Often, the people involved in these crimes belong to local gangs or even to the militias of large clans.
In opposition, Hamas adamantly refused to collect illegal weapons.
Now, it will have to deal with a Palestinian society that is armed to the teeth, with poverty rates reaching 70% and unemployment at 35% .
Having benefited from overwhelming political rejection of Fatah, Hamas will now be judged by how it uses its new authority.
For the first time, a political clock is ticking for Hamas.
Senior Hamas officials are well aware of the challenge, and have promised a complete overhaul of Palestinian public services and administration.
More than anything else, Hamas's success in the coming months will be measured by its response to these issues.
Will Hamas be able to root out corruption and incompetence, and deliver services fairly and efficiently?
How will its election affect Palestine's foreign aid inflows, which form major component of the national budget?
Initial international reaction to the Hamas victory has been severe.
The Bush administration has declared that it will not deal with a Hamas government, because Hamas remains committed to Israel's destruction.
This, indeed, is the language of Hamas's 1988 covenant.
Interestingly, however, Hamas's election platform combined different approaches to the issue of a Palestinian state.
On the one hand, Hamas agreed for the first time to the establishment of a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza, with East Jerusalem as its capital.
On the other hand, the platform repeats Hamas's refusal to relinquish even an inch of historic Palestine.
Whether Hamas can actually be transformed into a more moderate organization is impossible to say right now.
But it is clear that Hamas is now vulnerable to public opinion and, as a governing authority, will have to deal with the international response to its victory.
Immediately after the election, a senior Hamas official, Mahmoud al-Zahar, said that Hamas would maintain the cease-fire with Israel begun last February, if Israel did the same.
Hamas may be signaling that it will not provoke Israel.
Perhaps its governing responsibilities will push Hamas toward ongoing discussions with the United States and the international community.
In any case, despite the election results, and even without Fatah in government, Abbas remains in charge of negotiations with Israel.
He has quickly called for a revival of peace talks, although Israel, like the US, has refused to deal with Hamas.
Palestinians have entered uncharted waters.
They turned out in droves to vote in an election that former US President Jimmy Carter described as honest, fair and unmarked by violence.
They elected a party which called for "reform and change" in response to a decade of violence and lawlessness.
And Palestinians accepted Hamas's view that negotiations based on the Oslo Accords could not achieve Palestinian rights and political ambitions.
Victory achieved, Hamas will take on the responsibility for the Palestinian side in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
With the Palestinians' future at stake -- not to mention the future of Israel and the Middle East -- no one can say if Hamas is up to the task.
Hamas and Fatah at the Crossroads
Since Hamas was founded in the early 1980's, it has refused to come under the leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO).
Hamas's victory in the parliamentary election earlier this year -- a democratic watershed -- demonstrated that it had come of age politically.
For the first time in Palestinian history, a religious party is dominant.
But Fatah has not accepted defeat, while Hamas is convinced that elements within Fatah agree with Israeli and American plans to topple the Hamas government.
Abbas remains the Palestinian president, and the Basic Law makes him commander of all Palestinian security forces.
However, while most official security forces remain loyal to him, over the past year Hamas has created an alternative security structure, built around a 4000-member "Operational Force."
Moreover, Hamas has announced plans to recruit 1,500 additional security personnel for the West Bank, Fatah's stronghold.
In recent weeks, the two sides have clashed frequently across the Gaza strip, heightening tensions further.
The confrontations have come at a time when Abbas has been trying to persuade Hamas to moderate its anti-Israel stance and ally with Fatah in a national unity government.
Abbas believes that Hamas's acceptance of negotiations with Israel is the only way to break the international sanctions that are devastating Palestinian society.
Despite this, both sides are building up their forces.
Intelligence reports suggest that Hamas is smuggling weapons and explosives from the Sinai into the Gaza Strip at an accelerated pace.
The United States, Israel, and some Arab governments plan to arm and train forces loyal to Abbas, especially his presidential guard.
They want to prepare Abbas's forces in Gaza for a confrontation with Hamas, which they believe is inevitable.
Israel is considering Abbas's request to transfer arms and ammunitions from Egypt and Jordan in hopes of bolstering his loyalist forces.
There is also an American proposal to allow the Badr Brigade -- a wing of the Palestine Liberation Army that is currently stationed in Jordan -- to relocate to the Palestinian territories as Abbas's rapid reaction force in Gaza in anticipation of a feared civil war.
The Badr Brigade is composed of several thousand Palestinians, mostly long-time PLO activists.
As the maneuvering continues, Israel and Egypt find themselves working together to bolster Abbas and Fatah.
With the Gaza Strip in its backyard, Egypt has already mediated several times between Hamas and Fatah, and has been trying, so far unsuccessfully, to arrange a swap of prisoners with Israel following Hamas's abduction of Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit.
But Egypt's government is angry with Hamas for opposing the formation of a coalition government.
Indeed, the seizure of Shalit deepened the rift between Hamas and Fatah, which believes that the abduction was staged in order to sabotage discussions about a national unity government.
More generally, Egypt is concerned that Gaza is becoming politically radicalized and may be transformed into "Hamastan."
This, Egypt fears, would give a boost to its own Islamic radicals, against which the government has long fought.
Egypt also worries about a possible Hamas-Fatah civil war.
Although Hamas has ruled this out, it has shown no hesitation to use heavy force against its opponents.
Likewise, Foreign Minister Mahmoud Al-Zahar of the Hamas-led government says that any dissolution of the government or call for early elections by Abbas would be a recipe for civil war.
Fear of major fighting has already sent many Palestinians into Egypt, leading to the deployment of Egyptian troops on the border to control any mass exodus.
Israel, meanwhile, is worried that Hamas has strengthened its military grip on Gaza, in terms of both fortifications and networks capable of launching Qassam rockets into neighboring Israeli towns.
Israel might not wait for Abbas and his forces, but rather launch a full-scale intervention to weaken Hamas.
Can Hamas and Fatah put aside their differences and form a unity government?
Abbas says that if a coalition government is not agreed upon within the next two weeks, he will dissolve the current government, a move Hamas will not tolerate.
But forming a coalition government is unlikely to ease the tension between Hamas and Fatah.
New confrontations would likely emerge as soon as a new government was formed.
Ironically, the most likely way to avoid large-scale confrontation between Fatah and Hamas is through an Israeli incursion into Gaza.
Facing the Israelis together is the only way that the rival Palestinian groups will postpone their own bloody showdown.
Palestine's House Divided
The Hamas/Fatah face-off marks a dramatic shift in Palestinian politics, whose top priorities until now has been an end to the Israeli occupation and the establishment of an independent state.
It also tremendously complicates peace negotiations, which both the Palestinians and the "Quartet" (the United States, the European Union, the United Nations, and Russia) had premised on maintaining the Gaza Strip and the West Bank as a single territorial unit.
Ironically, these territories were reunited by Israel's victory in the 1967 war, after 19 years of separation.
Previously, Egypt had ruled in Gaza, while Jordan annexed the West Bank.
Under Israel's occupation, and then with the establishment of the Palestinian Authority (PA) in 1994, the territories remained separated geographically, but not politically.
The Hamas takeover in Gaza has -- at least for now -- ended that political unification.
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has now set his conditions for dialogue.
Hamas must withdraw its armed men from all security headquarters they occupied, return power to the legitimate authority, and apologize to the Palestinian people.
Although internal division harms Palestinians' national interest, it is unlikely amid mutual accusations and incitements that dialogue between Fatah and Hamas will be conducted soon.
But the fear that is most consuming Abbas and Fatah is that the conflict with Hamas might spread to the West Bank.
To avoid such a scenario, Abbas has banned all militias and military groups in the West Bank, including his Fatah Party's al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades.
Abbas has succeeded in convincing Israel to grant amnesty to many Fatah fugitives in the West Bank who will join his security apparatuses.
Abbas has also asked Israel to allow the PLO's Badr Brigade, currently stationed in Jordan, to enter the West Bank.
That would give Abbas an additional 3,000 well-equipped and trained troops.
Following King Abdullah II of Jordan's intervention, Israel appears to have agreed to allow the Badr Brigade's entry with full arms and ammunition.
If Fatah is to become a viable partner for peace and regain its grassroots support, it must reform itself and end the widespread corruption that has undermined its reputation.
Abbas must also share power with more disciplined, younger leaders.
Israel can help Abbas by releasing senior Fatah leader Marwan Barghouti, who is currently serving five life sentences in an Israeli prison.
Owing to his influence with the Fatah militias, Barghouti's release could help Abbas and the discredited Fatah leadership, and boost the younger generation of Fatah leaders.
Israel is divided on how to deal with Hamas, which will also complicate the start of peace talks.
Some Israelis argue that Hamas should be encouraged to establish order in Gaza and provide assurances to its neighbors.
If Hamas can establish order inside Gaza, prevent violence against Israel, and stop missile attacks against Israeli towns and villages, it might avoid Israeli military intervention.
But the dominant view in Israel is that Hamas is a direct threat, unwilling to stop attacks on Israel.
For Israel, last summer's fight with Hezbollah in Lebanon demonstrated the risks of allowing radical Islamists to consolidate their power on Israel's border.
Sooner or later, Israel is likely to deal with Hamas militarily, perhaps even by re-occupying Gaza.
One reason neighboring countries may take part in peace talks is that Egypt and Jordan fear that Hamas could begin actively to support these countries' own Islamic opposition groups.
Moreover, Egypt, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia -- the three main Sunni Muslim regimes -- are concerned that Gaza could provide a base for their regional non-Arab foe, Shiite Iran.
Their fear is based on Iranian support for Islamist groups -- Sunni and Shiite -- in Iraq, Lebanon, and Palestine, as well as its ongoing relationship with Syria.
If the Hamas-Fatah split brings about another territorial partition, Palestinians' national aspirations will suffer their gravest setback in the last half-century.
Although the overwhelming majority of Palestinians reject the use of force to settle this power struggle, many welcome the change in Gaza, where Hamas has cleared the streets of armed militias and restored some law and order.
The Palestinians confront a harsh reality.
Whatever actions are taken to confront Hamas will undermine the Palestinian national project.
A house divided against itself cannot stand, said Abraham Lincoln.
And a Palestine divided against itself will never secure its independence.
Hamas Takes on the Radicals
With Hamas in control for more than two years, the Gaza Strip has long been considered much more traditional and conservative than the West Bank.
Nevertheless, in Gaza's political milieu, Hamas is a moderate Islamic group that opposes al-Qaeda-style extremism.
But such extremist Islamic groups have been gaining support in Gaza, and Hamas has noticed.
The shoot-out in the mosque shows that Hamas will be ruthless in taking them on.
Various Salafi extremist groups have been operating in Gaza for years.
Salafis, whose name is derived from the Arabic phrase for "righteous ancestors," known as "Salaf al-Salih," insist on a return to what they consider the purity of the practices of the first Muslims.
Hamas has, in the past, cooperated with some of the Salafis, assuming they would stand behind Hamas's leadership.
The Army of Islam joined in the raid that abducted the Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit in June 2006.
The group also took responsibility for the 2007 kidnapping of the BBC's Gaza correspondent Alan Johnston, who was later released after negotiations led by Hamas.
The Warriors of God is one of a handful of radical, al-Qaeda-inspired groups to have appeared in the Gaza Strip in recent months, first coming to public attention in June after claiming responsibility for a failed horseback attack on Israel from Gaza.
Their Web site shares images, language, and music with al-Qaeda and other jihadi groups.
In a recent declaration, the group made favorable mention of al-Qaeda leaders Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri.
The Warriors of God demands a pure form of Islamic practice throughout the Gaza Strip, including the implementation of Sharia religious law and a rejection of democracy.
Indeed, the confrontation at the mosque followed the declaration of an Islamic Caliphate in Gaza, a flagrant rejection of Hamas's authority.
Many young men in Gaza have become increasingly radicalized.
Pakistani-style dress has become common, as is the long hair that is thought to resemble the style of the Prophet Mohammad.
At the same time, violence against "law-breakers" is on the rise.  Internet cafes have been bombed, institutions with Christian affiliations burned down, foreign schools attacked, and wedding parties assaulted.
There are substantial ideological differences between Gaza's Salafi al-Qaeda affiliates and Hamas.
As a ruling party, Hamas has insisted that its sole concern is the Palestinian people, not a global Islamic revolution.
Hamas has not imposed Islamic law in the Gaza Strip.
The Salafi groups, however, appear increasingly influenced by the growth of radical al-Qaeda-style extremism in Pakistan, Iraq, and Afghanistan.
While traditional Salafi movements have stayed away from politics, the younger groups see activism and violence as the best means of realizing their goals.
But Hamas's failure to establish and implement Islamic law is not the only issue that rankles.
One of the reasons for these groups' increased appeal is the de facto cease-fire between Israel and Hamas, which has led some in Gaza to charge that Hamas has been neutralized as a resistance force.
With the border closed under Israeli blockade for more than two years, levels of poverty, unemployment, and despair have grown, with young men increasingly interested in joining the global jihad as it comes to Gaza.
Indeed, Hamas' confrontation with Salafi groups comes as Israel is charging that dozens of foreign terrorists have crossed into Gaza from the Sinai Desert to join the violent underground.
Hamas's crackdown thus highlights its desire to maintain control over its conflict with Israel.
The threat of Salafi extremism in Gaza is far from over.
Salafis have threatened to retaliate against Hamas, particularly the security brigades that led the counter-attack on the mosque.
A new Salafi group called the Brigade of Swords of Righteousness has declared its obedience to the Warriors of God, and has warned Gazans to stay away from government buildings, security headquarters, mosques attended by Hamas leaders, and other official buildings.
The group now considers these legitimate targets.
With hundreds of tunnels connecting the Gaza Strip and Sinai, it is very difficult to control the flow of arms, ammunition, and possibly foreign fighters.
Hamas's battle with these radicals, who detonated suicide bombs and killed six Hamas security men during the mosque fight, is just beginning.
Residents are afraid that Gaza could become another Iraq, with bombings and mass killings a daily occurrence.
Hamas will use all means necessary to protect its power, and to break the jihadi groups now spreading in Gaza.
In the process, Hamas hopes to win the international legitimacy that it has long sought.
The Time is Now to Fight Disease
It is possible for a child born just ten years from now to live in a world where AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria are on the wane.
But this can only happen with considerable investment.
Now.
Otherwise, today's grim picture will only get worse.
Each day, these diseases kill 16,000 people—devastating entire communities and plummeting countries deeper into poverty.
Upping the ante could turn the tables.
Recent successes in Brazil against AIDS, in Mozambique against malaria, and in China against TB, show what can be achieved on a global scale with more resources.
There are new ways of directing aid to where it is most needed.
A key instrument is the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria.
Created in 2002 as a partnership between governments and civil society, the Global Fund is unique in the way it aims to deliver assistance.
Driven by real needs on the ground, projects are designed and implemented by recipients, and its procedures and operations are transparent.
Of late there has been much talk about intensifying efforts to eradicate poverty.
Ahead of the G8 summit in Scotland in July, a coalition of non-governmental organizations has launched the "Global Call to Action Against Poverty," and the UK host has made Africa a top priority.
Building on this momentum, the campaigns for debt relief, trade reform, and increasing aid to poor countries have gained traction.
Yet, while pledges to increase development assistance have soared, short-term funding is woefully inadequate.
Any strategy for raising living standards must include urgent measures that address AIDS, TB and malaria.
Stemming the spread of this deadly trio of diseases is the linchpin in the global fight against poverty.
Unchecked, these diseases not only sap the strength of national economies, but jeopardize peace and security.
Teachers and nurses are dying; police and security forces are being hard hit, and 14 million children have already been orphaned by AIDS.
We now risk failing to meet the Millennium Development GOAL, set out by the United Nations, of reversing the spread of AIDS, TB and malaria by 2015.
This failure will make remote any hope of reaching the other Millennium goals in the fight against poverty.
A comprehensive response to AIDS, TB and malaria is needed.
Acting now means less spending in the long run.
Investments in effective prevention, treatment and research in 2005 and 2006 will save millions of lives, lessen the socio-economic impact of the diseases in poorer countries, and remove the need for increased spending on these chronic crises in the future.
The Global Fund plays an important role in this funding environment, providing approximately 66% of all current external funds in the fight against TB, 45% in the fight against malaria, and 20% of all external support to combat HIV/AIDS.
Since the Global Fund was founded three years ago, it has built an impressive track record: approving 310 grants totaling $3.1 billion in 127 countries and disbursing $920 million since 2002.
Despite the scope of its mission, it has a minimal bureaucracy, which allows for a flexible response to changing needs.
The Global Fund is not perfect; as with all new organizations, it is experiencing growing pains.
Yet, issues such as procurement policies, trade-offs between efficiency and ownership, and the balance between government and non-governmental organizations as implementing partners are being addressed through the Fund's open and inclusive governance systems.
If the Fund is to live up to its potential it will need $2.3 billion to continue its work effectively in 2005.
The first of two replenishment conferences for the Global Fund is taking place this week in Stockholm, with the aim of securing financial pledges to cover grant commitments in 2006-2007, as well as to fill the gap for this year.
Donors have long preached the importance of a funding vehicle such as the Global Fund—one that is needs-driven, relies on local input, and promotes donor coordination.
They now have a chance to make good on their word.
With many battles ahead in the fight against AIDS, TB and malaria, it would be a disgrace if this opportunity is squandered.
Poverty and Terror
Glib assertions that poverty breeds terrorism have been tossed around of late.
Of course, no simple equation between the two can be drawn. Yet, such statements do contain grains of truth.
Poverty may not cause Islamic terrorism, but Islamic terrorists manipulate poverty to their advantage.
Thus, any viable strategy to prevent terrorism must address core issues of economic development.
The first issue to be recognized is that development took a wrong turn about 30 years ago, when OPEC imposed two severe oil-shocks on the global economy.
Developed countries shifted from promoting growth to fighting inflation.
World growth slowed dramatically (except in East Asia) and the growth of world trade was halved.
OPEC countries grew rich, while the rest of the developing world struggled with unsustainable trade deficits and indebtedness.
Most experienced negative growth.
During the 1980s and 1990s, half of the IMF's member developing countries endured severe financial crises and were forced to scale back social expenditures so that poverty, inequality and the potential for civil strife increased substantially.
In the wake of this, development policies changed.
America, the IMF, and the World Bank began to emphasize globalization by stressing trade liberalization, restrictive macro-economic policies and the institutional strengthening of markets - the policy package known as ``The Washington Consensus.''
International assistance was recast: development loans became ``structural adjustment loans,'' intended to help heavily indebted developing countries avoid default and made conditional upon countries undertaking reforms favored by the Washington Consensus.
Aid fatigue set in and, as the Cold War diminished, official aid flows declined as it was no longer necessary to bribe countries to keep them out of the Soviet camp.
For the average developing country the results were stagnation, widened economic inequalities, climbing unemployment, and increased numbers of poor people.
Economic modernization and poverty reduction suffered.
In Africa, per capita GNP dropped at an average rate of .7% annually between 1970 and 1995.
The median rate of growth in developing-country per capita GNP between 1980 and 1998 was 0.0% - no ringing endorsement of Washington Consensus policies.
The 1980s became a lost decade for development.
Of course, some bright spots emerged: ``high-development-level'' developing countries - Taiwan, Korea and most of Latin America - became democracies.
Between 1970 and 1990, the share of trade in GNP increased and the share of developing country manufactured exports rose, except in oil-countries.
Chile, China, India and Vietnam increased their growth rates substantially through labor-intensive export-led growth and market-oriented reforms, albeit at the cost of burgeoning inequality.
But poverty was not the only wound inflicted in these years.
Escalating oil-prices created a super-rich feudal aristocracy in the Gulf States.
The gaps between the cosmopolitan oil-sheiks and the disaffected, disenfranchised, and nearly hopeless remainder of the population widened.
Economic modernization was practically non-existent.
Significant increases in education coupled with little modern-job creation and rapid rural-urban migration added to social and political unrest.
The oil-regimes were oppressive, quelled dissent through torture, and were venal and corrupt.
Nonetheless, because of oil, they retained US support.
Small wonder some Arab youths became radicalized.
A small band of fiery Imams seized upon this youthful discontent.
Recalling the achievements of Islamic culture during the Middle Ages, they offered a (self-serving) nostrum for lifting Moslems out of dependence, degradation and misery: the reestablishment of theocratic Islamic States that would be more pure and just than secular ones.
Largely unnoticed by the West, they created a fanatical, totalitarian, movement that would stop at nothing, including self-immolation, to achieve its goals.
Who were their enemies?
Modernizing secular leaders (Nasser and Sadat in Egypt; the Shah in Iran); intellectuals who preached of a just secular order and exposed the excesses of the fundamentalist movement (Salman Rushdie); the small moderate Moslem middle class; the feudal, secular elites; infidels (moderate Moslems, Christians and Jews); and foreign powers that supported their enemies.
For several decades, their activities were largely limited to their own countries.
When Arab governments clamped down, they exported violence westward.
For now, the terrorist war is the policy response to the spread of Islamic terrorism.
In the long run, something beyond a military response is needed.
I believe that the West can learn a great deal about what to do by studying the policies pursued in the world's only two mid-development Moslem states, Tunisia and Indonesia, because each successfully avoided becoming prey to Islamic fundamentalism.
Tunisia's achievement is noteworthy given its proximity to violence-prone Algeria.
Both countries combined substantial increases in secular education with rapid job creation in manufacturing jobs; stressed rural development and labor-intensive exports; and pursued rapid, egalitarian development.
Egalitarian development of this sort is the only viable answer to the problems of the Moslem world's mal-development.
However, it provides no short-term answer to terrorism for several reasons: it does not supply an ideology compelling enough to compete with fundamentalism, which has captured at least two generations in the Moslem world.
Once radicalized, the genie of violence can rarely be put back into his bottle by civilized means.
Violence arises when there is hope rather than when things are hopeless.
Note that the terrorist leaders are not the poor and uneducated, and that the usual suspects among countries that sponsor terrorism are not the poorest Arab states.
Indeed, 1999, the year before the current Palestinian Intifada erupted, was a good year economically for the West Bank and Gaza.
Sadly, the politics of crackdown appears to be the only immediate answer to terrorist violence.
But if peace, once achieved, is to be maintained, genuine development that is more balanced among different aspects of development, which delivers more benefits to the poor and promotes economic convergence among countries, must become the West's goal.
While such policies might take decades to lessen Islamic terrorism, they may prevent radicalization in other developing countries.
Europe's Defense Investment Gap
Foreign policy disputes between Europe, France in particular, and the US are mounting, and not only over the Israeli-Palestinian bloodbath and the conduct of the anti-terrorism war.
But Europe's criticisms, no matter how sound, will not be taken seriously by the US so long as the Continent continues to free-ride on America's defenses, something it has done for half-a-century.
In a bellicose world, a credible voice in the international arena requires a creditable military capability and high-tech military technology.
In both, Europe is lacking.
America's irritation with some of its European allies - Tony Blair's UK being the noticeable exception - is understandable.
In the current fiscal year, the US will spend an additional $50 billion on defense, raising its overall defense bill to $379 billion, more than 3% of GDP.
This sum is, in fact, low by post-WWII standards.
At the time of the Gulf War of 1991, US defense spending was 4.8% of GDP; it was far higher in the 1950s and 1960s.
Europe's commitment to defense tells another story.
Defense spending is 1.6% of GDP in Germany, 2% in Italy, and 1.5% in Spain; only France and the UK reach 3%.
But confining discussion about defense commitment to the percent of GDP spent on the military is insufficient because there are economies of scale in defense spending.
So one would expect that smaller countries will spend proportionally more on defense than larger ones.
Instead, today America alone spends more than most of its NATO allies combined, and defense spending in the US is likely to increase even more in the years to come.
Security and global influence are not the only benefits that come through military expenditure.
About 10-15% of US military spending finances basic research and thus provides a powerful boost to America's high-tech research and development.
The internet, based on thinking and spending made in the 1940's, and the silicon chip, developed in the 1970's, are both products of research funded by the Pentagon.
The war in Afghanistan, which was truly revolutionary in the way it was conducted, proves how new information and communication technology can bring about success with a minimal number of men on the ground and minimal losses.
The Russians fought for ten hard years over the same terrain in Afghanistan. Lacking comparable technology, they lost tens of thousands of men and were eventually defeated.
At the beginning of the Afghan campaign many military "experts" feared that the US would face a similar fate.
How wrong they were!
Europe lags behind the US in R&D, and its stinginess over defense contributes mightily to a growing high tech "investment gap."
Data concerning patents documents America's advantage: in the late 1990s 56% of all global patents in high-tech fields was granted to US applicants, only 11% to EU applicants.
The connection between R&D and growth is too obvious to doubt that Europe's sluggish economies are a direct result of European backwardness at innovation - and that this in turn may reflect the absence of critical military spending to drive investments in research and development.
The ongoing dispute between Europe and the US over the choice of the military transport plane -to be used to deploy the new 60,000 strong European Rapid Reaction Force - is symptomatic of Europe's problems.
America would like Europe to opt for an aircraft built by Boeing and Lockheed Martin.
Europe is divided: some countries, notably Italy, support the US; others, notably France and Germany, argue in favor of a European plane built by Airbus in a $15 billion publicly funded project.
This is an issue on which Europe should stand up to the US.
The EU should fund the Airbus project and make sure that an important fraction of the money goes into R&D to foster the growth of an industry that is one of the few European high-tech success stories.
But where should the funds needed to pay for this huge investment come from?
In recent weeks European defense ministers suggested that increases in military expenditures should be excluded from the budget constraints imposed by the Euro stability pact.
The idea that a sharp increase in military spending in a (hopefully temporarily) bellicose world should be amortized with some deficits is consistent with sound economic policy, but only if the rest of the budget remains "lean."
This is the case in America, where nobody really worries if increased military spending will create a temporary deficit.
Not in Europe.
An increase in military spending, in conjunction with an enforcement of the stability pact, should bring about a trimming of the non-defense budget: the public sector wage bill and a welfare state grown far beyond the goal of supporting the incomes of the poor, would of necessity need to be trimmed sharply.
For half-a-century Europe has relied on the US for security, while spending its own money on a pricey welfare state.
This can no longer continue - at least not if the EU is serious about playing a leading role in the world.
This is not a pleasant message, but what happened in New York and Washington on September 11
Argentina: Open Up or Shut Down
But diplomatic explanations are not what Argentina needs.
It does not need to waste scarce money on diplomacy of dubious value--not when the country lacks an agency dedicated to helping Argentine businessmen sell their goods abroad.
Indeed, the sum Argentina spends on its diplomats is what tiny Ireland spends on its Export Promotion Agency, an institution Argentina never bothered to create.
Instead of talking to fellow diplomats, Argentina's ambassador to the US should talk to US supermarkets, convincing their managers to buy Argentine goods and arranging for them to meet with small businessmen from his country.
He should not be duplicating what Argentina's President and Foreign Minister are capable of doing.
Export diplomacy is important, but export promotion , visiting stores and talking to buyers, is even more vital.
European grocery shops are full of products from Israel, but how often do you see Argentine beef or other goods?
Argentina's economy opened up significantly in recent years, notwithstanding a strong exchange rate, which made exporting difficult.
Total exports doubled in 1991-2001, from US$12 billion to $25 billion, with industrial exports growing from $3 billion to $8 billion.
But the numbers remain very small.
In fact, Argentina is amazingly closed for an economy its size.
Exports do not exceed 10% of GDP, and manufactured goods account for only about a third of total exports.
Brazil, a country eight times the size, exports 12% of its economy's output, and 57% of Brazilian exports are manufactured goods.
Chile exports almost 30% of its output.
Some small European countries come close to 50%.
Little wonder, then, that Argentina's current crisis is so harsh: the portion of its economy that can generate the export revenues necessary to repay foreign debt is too small.
When a country reaches the point that it needs all its exports to service its national debt, and the size of the export sector is fixed, nothing is left to pay for imports.
So imports dry up and the economy stops.
The more open an economy is, the more easily it can avoid this trap.
Of course, all countries eventually overcome crises.
The question is how.
Argentina now faces a choice that is both economic and political.
The path of development that it chooses as it emerges from its crisis will determine the country's future for many years to come.
So it is surprising that this choice is not at the center of the political debate in the campaign for the presidency now underway.
There are two ways out of the current morass.
One is the old model: a recovery in real wages and a resumption of consumption.
Viewed from the despairing perspective of today's crisis, this model seems like a dream.
But if it is implemented, in 3-5 years Argentina will look exactly like the country we have always known: a largely closed economy that remains dangerously vulnerable to external shocks.
The Big Bang of Economic Freedom
Why is it so difficult to implement the deregulation needed to make an economy more competitive?
Why do so many governments try to achieve this end, and why do almost all of them fail?
All citizens stand to benefit from competitive markets for products and services, but more often than not, the broad coalition required to sustain pro-competitive policies never materializes; political support simply isn't there.
Why?
This question is important not only in transition economies and other emerging market countries, but in rich countries as well--in fact almost everywhere, except possibly the US and the UK, which long ago embarked on a process of radical and far-reaching economic liberalization.
New Zealand and Ireland followed suit and their economies have been booming ever since.
Lack of competition is typically due to over-regulation.
Taxicabs in European cities are expensive because the number of licenses is strictly controlled.
With market entry blocked, license owners face little pressure to hold down fares, and the officials who allocate licenses are well placed to collect votes or bribes.
In short, regulation tends to distort incentives, stimulating what economists call rent-seeking behavior: the taxi driver and the license official collect unearned premiums (rents) solely because they can exploit their position as insiders, not because they are more productive.
Notaries are another example of this phenomenon.
Public notaries in many countries charge extremely high fees for services that are virtually useless.
Fees are high because the notaries themselves control access to their profession.
Without government regulation (including rules requiring that consumers purchase their useless services), public notaries would not have the position from which they draw rents.
Examples of the benefits of deregulation abound.
The taxi market in Ireland is deregulated, and fares there are cheap.
For some time after US airlines were deregulated, the five-hour flight from New York to Los Angeles cost much less than the half-hour trip from Zurich to Frankfurt.
Similar discrepancies were found in the price of a coast-to-coast phone call in the US and that of a domestic long-distance call in France.
Whereas regulation creates unearned rents for overprotected minorities (taxi drivers, notaries, airline pilots, and telecom or electricity workers), deregulation reduces these rents and redistributes them to the general public.
But because overprotected minorities enjoy privileged access to politicians, it is no surprise that deregulation incites so much fierce--and effective--opposition.
Public utilities are a good example of this.
Whenever a government attempts to liberalize the electricity industry, unions and firms join forces in opposition.
Workers and management oppose deregulation because openness to competition would eliminate their unearned premiums.
The wages of electrical workers are high precisely because they have appropriated a part of the rents created in an uncompetitive electricity market.
Is there a way to weaken this opposition?
What if a government, instead of fighting the electricity industry alone, unleashed an economic "big bang," trying to liberalize most markets at once?
An analogous "all or nothing" procedure was used in the US in the 1980s to close unneeded military bases.
Since 1945, there had not been a single base closure.
Even though the Pentagon itself wanted to close many of them and use the money elsewhere, no measure could be gotten through the Congress, because military bases qualify as "pork" - the favors for their constituents that help congressmen get re-elected -- and, according to old and sacred informal rules, no congressman will ever vote against pork in a colleague's district.
But a plan to close numerous bases passed by an overwhelming majority when the congressional leadership finally agreed to present a single list of bases to be closed; the list could only be voted up or down, without any possibility of amendments.
Good sense triumphed over pork.
The cause of economic liberalization would be greatly advanced by adopting similar strategies.
For example, electricity workers would realize that, as consumers, their gains from lower prices throughout the economy more than compensate them for the loss of rents in their own firms.
The big bang approach gives workers a stake in liberalization and thus makes deregulation politically easier to pursue.
Deregulating product markets has an additional benefit: it facilitates liberalization of the labor market.
Evidence gathered by the OECD shows a strong positive correlation across countries between the degree of competition in the product market and the extent to which labor market regulations increase the powers of workers when they bargain with firms.
Bargaining is mostly about the distribution of excess rents between the firm and its workers.
In a competitive industry, where there are no excess rents, there is little to bargain about.
In some cases, however, regulation works in the opposite direction: it keeps the price of public services artificially low, rather than too high.
This is true of railway fares throughout continental Europe, which are subsidized by government.
Here again, winning the battle for deregulation requires convincing consumers that they stand to benefit.
Railway fares will be higher, but taxes will be lower, because only those who actually use trains will pay the costs, rather than the non-traveling taxpayers.
Deregulations of airlines and bus transportation will also create healthy competition for railroads and help keep prices from rising too far.
Piecemeal deregulation is doomed to fail.
Generating sufficient political support to enact reforms that can survive the opposition of vested interests requires attempting to deregulate the entire economy simultaneously, not select industries, one by one.
The key to eliminating inefficient, unproductive subsidies to minorities is to implement tax reductions for all.
Europe's University Challenge
The university systems in the US and Continental Europe couldn't be more different.
Which works better?
The answer is clear: America's by a long shot.
European universities are generally based on three misguided principles:
This system is supposedly more egalitarian than America's system of higher education, which many Europeans look down on as elitist.
In reality, Europe's system typically produces less research, worse students (especially at the doctoral level), and is probably less egalitarian than the US system.
Having taxpayers cover the costs of university education is indeed redistributive, but in the wrong direction--the beneficiaries are most often the children of comfortable European families.
Even taking a generous view, the best that can be said is that the system is neutral insofar as redistribution is concerned, because the wealthiest pay more taxes and use more university services.
In addition to favoring Europe's "haves," this system makes it virtually impossible for self-financed private universities to survive.
In fact, this is probably the true motivation of Europe's free public university system: to maintain the state's monopoly on higher education.
But consider, instead, the US system: students pay for their education and, with part of the tuition these students pay, universities finance scholarships for deserving but poor students.
Such a system is at least as "fair" as Europe's model, and probably more so than one in which taxpayers pay for everybody, including the rich.
Indeed, recent research comparing education in the US and Italy finds that family income is more important in determining a student's success (measured in terms of his salary) in "egalitarian" Italy than it is in "elitist" America.
But competition is as important as financing in determining a university's quality, because competition increases the merit of the product.
This is true in the US system, where public and private universities coexist happily.
The University of California at Berkeley is public.
Stanford University, an hour away down the coast, is private.
Both are among America's finest universities.
Competition between them works because it involves fighting for the best students and offering scholarships to deserving poor ones.
By contrast, Europe's centralization and bureaucratization control over universities produces only mediocrity.
Appointments in European universities are often governed by complex bureaucratic processes that involve countless "judges" chosen from all over a country.
This process is supposedly designed to "guarantee" that the best are appointed.
In reality, however, these judges make it easier for insiders to appoint their friends, rather than for the quality of research and teaching to determine who is hired.
Some countries, take France, are changing their systems by appointing a few academics from other countries onto hiring and promotion committees.
While this is obviously a move in the right direction, it will produce few results.
The best American universities operate their hiring processes internally, relying on outsiders only for expert opinions on the quality of a candidate professor's research.
What produces good appointments is the threat that mediocre professors will make it difficult to attract good students and large research grants.
Europe's tendency to equalize salary and treatment of professors and researchers also reduces the incentive to engage in good research and good teaching.
If the only factor that increases a professor's salary is the passage of time, why make the extra effort to excel?
Of course, love of research and teaching is why many people join university faculties in the first place, but why not give these noble sentiments a helping hand with appropriate financial incentives?
Low salaries are often part of an implicit bargain: in exchange for the bad pay, university administrators close their eyes to lazy teaching and research.
Moreover, if salaries are low, how can university deans stop their faculty members from scouring the country to do lucrative consulting?
The result is bad teaching, lousy research, and absentee professors.
US universities often use aggressive financial incentives and differential treatment of professors to reward good teaching and research.
Also, the private nature of contracts between an American university and its professors creates healthy competition for talent and a flexible and efficient market for scientists.
The result is that it is not uncommon for a bright, productive young professor in America to earn as much, if not more, than older and less productive colleagues.
In Europe, promising young researchers struggle and have to supplement teaching and research with outside jobs, while established professors earn good salaries.
Given these conditions, it should surprise no one that American universities nowadays are increasingly staffed by many of Europe's best scholars.
What is surprising in the face of this brain drain is the power of the lobby of university professors in Europe to block reform.
Old and Aging Europe
When US Secretary of Defence Donald Rumsfeld spoke recently of "Old Europe," he was right, but not in the way he intended.
Europe is indeed old, and growing older.
Across the continent children are increasingly scarce.
Fertility rates (the number of children per woman in the population) have fallen to 1.2% in Germany and Italy.
The rate is even lower in Spain --in fact, the lowest in Europe.
Spain is still a young society, but a society without children is doomed.
The fertility rate for the US, by contrast, is 2.4, and it is 2.1 for the UK.
These differences are extraordinary, particularly in view of the far less generous maternity leave policies that apply in the US and the UK relative to continental Europe.
France stands out on the Continent with a fertility rate of 1.8, which is most likely the result of years of generous tax policies towards large families.
Migration is also an important explanation for these differences.
Higher fertility rates in the US, the UK, and France reflect the large number of immigrant families in each country.
Fertility rates among immigrants are typically higher than in native European or North American families.
But increasing the number of immigrant workers will not necessarily raise fertility rates.
Germany, for example, has a large population of guest workers, but few settle there with their families; most leave their children in their homeland.
An aging population contributes to Europe's poor economic performance.
The old do not work, and a smaller and smaller share of the population (the disappearing young) is taxed to support them.
In turn, the high tax rates needed to support the old discourage the young from working, creating a vicious cycle: ever increasing tax rates on a disappearing labor force, lower growth rates, and fewer resources available to support those that retire at 60 and live into their 90's.
The effects of this are partly offset by the fact that, with fewer children, more women enter the labor force.
But then these women also retire (often at an even younger age than men) adding to the "unsupported" army of retirees.
Compare this with the US, where participation by women in the labor force also is increasing, despite America's higher fertility rate.
Indeed, female participation in the workforce is higher in the US than in the European Union (70% versus 60%).
The saving rates among Europe's old people indicate that they are worried about the dwindling number of workers who can be taxed to support them.
Consider Germany.
Any economic textbook will tell you (the famous "life-cycle" model) that the young save for their retirement, while the old spend what they accumulate.
But in Germany, the data seem to suggest a puzzling fact: the old save until their final days.
It is the young who spend.
Even more remarkable is not the level of savings among the old, but how it changes over time.
Recent German surveys have detected a small increase in their savings rate.
Why should old people save?
The most plausible reason is that many now realize that they will live far longer than they anticipated--often spending one-third of their lives in retirement--but that the State may no longer deliver on its promises.
Default is unlikely, although not impossible, on pension benefits.
But it is more likely on the provision of health services, by far the most important service for old people.
When you understand that you are likely to live into your late 80's or beyond, and you also understand that the quality of public health services is deteriorating, you save more to take care of yourself.
So why do Europeans have fewer and fewer children?
Indeed, non-working time even for those who hold jobs is increasing, offering ample opportunity to rear children.
Working hours in Europe as a whole fell from 1713 hours per year in 1980 to about 1576 today, with Germans putting in the least number of hours at work.
One explanation often mentioned points to a lack of support, such as public childcare, for mothers raising children.
But, then, why is America's birth rate higher than in many countries in Europe that have much larger public support for childbearing mothers?
High housing costs and imperfection in lending markets are the more likely explanation behind Europe's falling fertility rates.
It is easier for a young couple to borrow and buy a house in the US than in Europe.
Rental markets are also more flexible in the US.
So another dangerously vicious circle seems to be operating: high taxes discourage work, and because fewer jobs are created, fertility is discouraged.
But with fewer children, higher tax rates are needed to support the growing army of the old.
Gunther Grass famously titled one of his novels "Headbirths, or the Germans are Dying Out."
Little could he know how true his fantasy would just three decades later.
Europe's Overdue Reformation
War and its huge cost; the falling dollar; mounting trade and budget deficits; the chicanery that hollowed out companies like Enron and WorldCom; the bursting of the high-tech bubble: capitalism American-style is both under strain and under a cloud.
From left to right, many European intellectuals think that the capitalist game as played by the US is passé.
An active search is on for new models.
Strong on rhetoric and fueled by a wave of anti-Americanism, that search is nonetheless thin on facts.
Stories of corporate malfeasance do, of course, abound in the US.
But it is facile to jump from individual corporate scandals to broad conclusions about the supposed rottenness of the American economy.
A close look at productivity growth (output per hour worked) in the US and Europe shows that US capitalism remains as vital than ever.
Having grown at an average annual rate of just 1.6% since the early 1970's, annual US productivity growth in the non-farm business sector has accelerated to an average of 2.6% in the seven years since 1995, with no sign of a slowdown.
In 2002, productivity grew by 4.8% - an extraordinary result, because productivity normally falls during economic slowdowns.
Now look at Europe.
Annual productivity growth actually slackened in the second half of the1990's, from 2.5% to just 1.3% today.
This productivity gap is often attributed to the "New Economy" that emerged in the late 1990's.
True, many new technologies were developed and first applied in the US.
But technology spreads rapidly: the same Windows or SAP programs are available in all countries, including Europe.
So there must be other differences.
Two candidates stand out: attitudes toward work and corporate governance.
Six OECD countries do better than America in terms of output per hour worked: Norway, Belgium, France, Ireland, the Netherlands, and Germany.
But the rankings change if you make output per capita (a better measure of a country's economic well-being) the standard: here the US comes first, and France and Germany drop, respectively, to 16th and 11th place.
The reason for examining output per person rather than output per hour worked is simple: what determines a nation's wealth is how much each person works, and how many people work.
This is where the US overtakes Europe: fewer people work in Europe than in the US, and those in Europe who do work don't work as much.
Annual hours worked in the US are about 1800, about 1500 in France, and 1400 in Germany.
One reason why Europeans work less is because they pay more taxes, and high taxes are necessary to support those who do not work - an obvious vicious circle.
But something deeper is at work.
Perhaps the Europeans are perfectly happy to work less and enjoy more free time, both in terms of having more vacations during their working age, and spending less time in the active labor force.
This is a legitimate choice, but once made, Europeans should stop looking for scapegoats for slow growth.
For the source of the problem is neither the European Central Bank, nor the Stability Pact.
Europe grows less because it works less - and it should not be surprised if a number of so-called "developing countries" soon catch up with Europe in terms of income per capita.
The availability of new technologies is a necessary, but by no means sufficient, condition to raise a country's standard of living, because there must also be companies that are able to make use of them.
In the early 20th century, it took over twenty years for the electrical engine to transform the textile industry.
New machines were available, but firms were not prepared to use them.
To do so required a change in work practices and in the way firms were run.
Unions opposed such change, but it also took time for bosses to understand that the way they ran their plants needed to change.
The new economy arrived after a decade of deep transformation within US companies.
During the 1980's, a wave of leveraged buyouts transformed US corporate culture, evidently making bosses more receptive to technological innovation.
Not so in Europe, where the interests of a company's employees and their unions often come before those of its shareholders.
Indeed, at one European newspaper, articles that arrived via e-mail were re-typed by typographers: the technology for transferring them electronically was available, but not the work rules to allow the paper to apply it.
Unions are not the only culprits.
Many European firms have complex ownership structures, with large shareholders whose interests often conflict with those of the company - hardly the best way to take sound business decisions.
This is particularly true in finance and banking.
Whatever the corporate horror stories in US banks, almost no European investment bank remains, and Germany is seriously considering a state-owned "bad bank" to bail out its all-powerful banking giants.
If Europe wants to work less, it must be extraordinarily productive when it does work if it is to keep up with the hard-working Americans.
That is why Europeans should hope that the wave of corporate restructuring and reformation, which many thought would follow inevitably in the wake of the creation of the single market, begins to crest across the Continent and change the way businesses are run.
Hands Off the "Super-Euro"
Three years ago, the European single currency, the Euro, was born at an exchange rate of 1:$1.17, which presumably was deemed to reflect appropriately price levels on both sides of the Atlantic at that time.
The Euro's exchange rate has since endured a roller-coaster ride.
Now, it has returned to almost exactly its opening level.
So why is the European business community claiming that the "super Euro" is bringing calamity down upon their heads?
The answer is that blaming the Euro is an easy way to deflect attention from the true cause of Europe's economic malaise: a surprisingly low level of productivity per capita.
Europe's low productivity reflects a simple statistical fact that fatally undermines relatively high productivity per hours worked: weak participation in the active labor force means that Europeans work a very low number of hours.
It is important to clarify a few fundamental points regarding the Euro/dollar exchange rate, because this is an issue on which confusion--often generated strategically--pervades public debate.
First, nobody knows how to explain or predict the short-term movements (from one day to six months, say) of exchange rates.
A famous academic paper about 20 years ago showed that a random walk was better at predicting short-run exchange rate movements than any fancy mathematical model based on selected economic variables.
That conclusion still applies.
Nobody had a clear idea why the Euro plummeted to almost $0.80 in its first year and a half of trading, and nobody could predict when it would recover.
Some observers attribute the current "high" level of the Euro (and thus low growth in Europe) to tight monetary policy on the part of the European Central Bank (ECB).
But if high interest rates are causing the Euro's rise, why was the dollar appreciating in periods when the US Federal Reserve cut rates aggressively?
People should be wary of commentators who purport to explain "why" a currency's exchange rate is doing what it is doing.
Second, exporters who blame the current level of the Euro for their difficulties should wake up to reality.
The current level of the Euro makes prices on both sides of the Atlantic relatively similar.
If an exporting firm is only profitable when the Euro falls to $0.80 or $0.90, it better start increasing productivity fast if it is to survive with the Euro back up at $1.17.
For many years Germany and Japan dominated world exports, and at the time both the yen and the Deutsche Mark were among the "strongest" currencies in the world.
It was innovation, and high productivity, not a weak currency, that enabled German and Japanese goods to conquer the world.
Third, the Euro area is about as open to international trade as the US.
The US economy was flying in the 1990s, when the dollar was strong.
As was true for Germany and the Deutsche Mark and remains true for Japan and the yen, a strong dollar has not historically caused weak US growth.
Europeans are used to thinking of the exchange rate as a critical variable, because they live in very open economies that export close to 50% of their total output.
But most of these exports go to other Euro-zone countries, and are thus unaffected by the level of the Euro.
Exports outside the Euro area claim only 15-16% of Europe's total output, and will be even less when (and if) Sweden and the UK join the Euro.
So commentators, policymakers, and businessmen should stop calling for the ECB to do something about the "strong Euro."
Central bank intervention in the currency market is merely destabilizing, and therefore counter-productive.
The ECB was right to ignore the exchange rate when it fell to $0.80, and it is right to ignore it today when it is close to $1.20. Most economists believe that central banks should only target inflation, which means cutting interest rates only when the economy slows down and inflation falls--which is precisely what the ECB has been doing.
The bottom line is that Europeans should worry and talk less about the Euro exchange rate, and spend the time they save trying to address their real problems: low productivity, market rigidities, fiscal polices constrained by the Stability Pact, and bankrupt pension systems.
Europe's economic policymakers have enough problems on their plate.
They should let the currency markets take care of the Euro/dollar exchange rate.
The Dangers of Gray Power
With rare bipartisan agreement, the Bush administration is proposing a substantial increase in benefits for the elderly.
The proposed reforms may cost US taxpayers more than President Bush's massive tax cut of 2001, and one that implies a very significant redistribution from America's young to its old.
But while many observers have pointed out the risks associated with Bush's tax cuts, and the gaping deficits that have followed, few seem worried about the added deficits that will arise from this gift to the old.
What is happening in America is but more evidence of the vast power exercised by the elderly in our societies.
Similar moves are afoot throughout Europe, where the generosity of state-sponsored pension plans has become unsustainable, but reforming the system is almost impossible politically.
The rise of pensioners' political power results from a multiplicity of factors.
The first is simply that in every industrial society, people are living longer lives and having fewer children.
Combine this with the generous retirement rules that were designed in the 1970's, when the post-war baby-boomers were just about to join the labor market and the welfare state seemed to be free of budget constraints, and you create an entitlement that no one wants to tinker with.
The second factor empowering the pensioners' lobby is that the old are, on average, richer than the young, simply because they have been around longer and so have had more time to accumulate wealth.
Being richer, they can provide more financial support to parties and politicians who will defend their interests than the young, who might want to push for pension reform.
Finally, pensioners have time in their hands, which they dedicate to organize political activities in their own interest.
Two examples: many trade union leaders in Italy are retirees, and retirees account for the largest proportion of the members of the most powerful and militant union, the CGIL.
In the US, retirees tend to vote more than the young.
Indeed, their power in America was perhaps best symbolized by the fact that a relatively few elderly men and women in Florida decided the last Presidential election!
All of this generates a vicious circle: the stronger the political power of pensioners and of older workers, the greater the pressure on government to shorten working lives and increase pension benefits.
This in turn raises the share of voters who are dependent on pensions, and thus the political power of retirees.
In a recent article, Vincenzo Galasso and Paola Profeta from Bocconi university in Milan show that, in Italy, this nexus is now the major obstacle to pension reform.
As time passes, the political support for reform dwindles, at least until the system blows up.
Another aspect that makes reforms difficult is that public pensions systems redistribute income from the rich to the poor because these systems are typically structured as ``defined benefits'' systems.
Pensions are linked to final wages rather than to the actual contribution made by the worker over his or her lifetime.
The extent of this redistribution varies from one country to another, but it is present throughout the OECD, including in the US.
Within the anti-reform coalition, those who favor redistribution, typically young and on the political left, thus often join retirees and older workers.
The result is an extremely powerful political movement that extends from left to right, and includes young and old alike.
The clear losers are young workers, and the future generations who will face the high tax burdens necessary to pay retirees their promised benefits.
The redistribution implicit in many pension systems is often far from ``clean.''
Many systems entail politically motivated privileges for powerful lobbies.
In Brazil, the pension plan of private sector workers runs a small surplus, but that of civil servants runs an enormous deficit, equivalent to of 4.5% of Brazil's GDP.
French public-sector employees recently brought the country to a standstill when targeted by a reform whose main objective was rather modest: to bring their benefits into line with those in the private sector.
It is encouraging that the French government eventually prevailed, and interesting how this happened.
After weeks of paralyzing strikes, Prime Minister Raffarin's government began a campaign to convince voters that the reform was simply removing the privileges of a small minority.
The point sold well and civil servants found themselves isolated.
Of course, given the political risks, governments should not wait for confrontation with pensioners.
Officials can take two obvious steps to avoid it altogether. First, increase the age of retirement.
This has two obvious benefits: it cuts the overall cost of the system by shrinking the number of retirees, and thus weakens the constituency that opposes reform.
Second, eliminate the redistribution implicit in the system.
Any redistribution, indeed, should be transparent, and take place via taxation and non pension-related transfers.
Of course, it is easy to understand why this does not happen: when redistribution is transparent, those who pay for it can complain.
When redistribution takes place via the pension system, it is paid for by unborn generations, who have no voice in the next election.
In the meantime, one can only suggest to our grandparents that they compensate their grandchildren by leaving them generous private bequests along with high tax burdens.
Reforming Europe from Below
Look at European history for the past 25 years, and you see that from the late 1970's to the early 1990's the continent was plagued by macroeconomic instability, high unemployment, over-regulated markets--including, importantly, financial markets--unregulated monopolies, and inefficient state-run industries.
Over the past decade Europe has made important progress in restoring macroeconomic stability, but it has been less successful in enacting the micro-level reforms that are necessary to deregulate markets and improve their efficiency.
Why is this?
Is there a lesson in this for the countries of Central and Eastern Europe as they prepare to join the EU?
High inflation and mounting public debt generated a feeling of ``crisis'' in the early 1990's in some EU countries: when one's house is on fire, the costs of doing nothing are too large to continue sitting back and doing nothing.
It took the exchange rate crisis of 1992, for instance, to make Italy's leaders realize that something had to be done about the country's public finance mess.
The fear of being left out of the euro did the rest, by creating a political consensus in favor of taking the right and necessary steps.
Today, Europe's economic house is no longer on fire.
So it has become much harder to break the back of special interests in order to liberalize markets and improve economic efficiency.
Just this past June, for example, France went through a 1968-style month of strikes and street protests only to implement minor pension reforms: the elimination of a few special privileges enjoyed by public sector employees.
In a sense such pusillanimous reforms are the outcome of Europe having become a more ``normal'' place.
Europe simply could not afford the failure of the euro project, so it's leaders did what was necessary.
But no one, it seems, will stop this rich continent from living with slow growth, high unemployment, and inefficient markets.
There is no ``crisis'' associated with that choice--just slow decline.
The Maastricht convergence criteria that led to the euro's creation worked because they were imposed by a multinational agreement and were monitored multinationally.
More importantly, the ``punishment'' for not complying was clear, strong, and certain: exclusion from the monetary union.
None of that threatens Europe today.
So member states have precious little incentive to continue the reform process?
But could something like the Maastricht process be used to implement structural reform?
In a sense, such a process is already at work.
One mechanism that has often been effective at reining in powerful special interests in individual EU states, and thus at implementing structural reforms, is action by the European Commission.
France decided to permit a very mild opening of its domestic electricity market the day before the start of formal proceedings against France at the European Court of Justice for infringement of an EU directive.
Italy ended 70 years of active involvement by the state in industry thanks to the determination of the EU competition commissioners, Karel van Miert and his successor, Mario Monti.
Obviously the European Commission can play a positive role only if it embraces a stance in favor of liberalizing markets and does not fall into the trap of focusing on coordinating national regulation throughout the Union.
Regulation of markets does need to be coordinated; but it also needs to be eliminated in many cases.
Consider Europe's financial markets, which provide an alternative way to break the reform deadlock.
In the old Europe, with fragmented financial markets, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's request that Mannesmann remain a German company in the face of a (successful) takeover bid by Vodaphone was tantamount to his following an order by the company's mostly German shareholders.
As it turned out, such action no longer works in a world in which European companies are exposed to the scrutiny of international investors.
European financial markets were, and to some extent still are, dominated by a few large banks.
When the euro was launched banks in Europe accounted for some 80% of total firm financing, as compared to 30% in the US.
Banks are often less prepared to finance a risky, but possibly bright idea.
As lenders, they are also less efficient at monitoring firms than shareholders are.
Before the advent of the euro, local markets were small and illiquid.
The development of modern, highly liquid financial markets has been one of the main benefits of the euro: in a few years, for instance, bank lending in Germany fell from 74% to 32% of the total funds raised by large German companies.
In Italy the share of bank lending as a percent of the total funds raised by big Italian companies fell from 75% to 50%--the difference being made up mostly by emissions of corporate bonds.
The lesson for new member countries from the East is clear: once you are in the Union, the outside pressure to reform decreases: the impetus to reform must be found at home.
Reforms aimed at deregulating financial markets should be the priority.
The Great Job Machine
Until the third quarter of this year, the number one doubt facing the US economy concerned the Pyrrhic character of its "jobless" recovery.
Then, during September and October of this year, net employment grew by 290,000, well ahead of most forecasts.
But while more than 300,000 new jobs were created in services, over 50,000 manufacturing jobs were lost.
This is more than can be explained by the long-term shift of the economy out of industry and into services.
At the same time, the jump in labor productivity in manufacturing--by 7.2% in the third quarter--indicates that there remains a great deal of excess capacity in the manufacturing sector.
So don't look for any improvement in US employment to come through factory jobs.
Instead, it is the greater flexibility of services that has produced the resumption of employment growth in the US.
Evidence for such growth abounds.
For example, Kohl's, a large department store, has opened 48 new sites in October, hiring some 140 people at each of them.
Stop & Shop, a chain of supermarkets, has reintroduced a delivery service from cashiers to a client's car--something done away with decades ago--and has extended opening hours in many stores.
America's reborn service economy stands in stark contrast to what is found in Europe.
Thanks to the European Commission's tough competition policy, Europe has gone a long way towards making its industries more viable.
In the service sector, by contrast, deregulation has been much more limited, probably because services are much less exposed to international competition, which means that old hidebound rules are easier to preserve.
The outcome is that in Europe, contrary to the US, an increase in the demand for services produces higher rents, rather than more jobs.
Take the simple case of taxi licenses: if the number of taxi licenses is fixed, and consumers start using taxis more often, what you will observe is, at most, an increase in the demand for powerful Mercedes cars that taxi drivers use, not an increase in jobs.
In other words, a good indicator of the state of the US economy is how many people take care of you at a supermarket cashier.
In many European countries, you should instead look at the quality of the stereo in your taxi.
The labor market flexibility in the US service sector is truly remarkable.
During recessions and booms, you can feel the changes in quality and number of waitresses in restaurants, in the size of staffs in shops, in the availability of cleaning services.
In the roaring 1990's, it was almost impossible to find qualified restaurant staff to fill vacant jobs.
During the stagnant economic years of the Bush administration, such workers were plentiful.
In Europe, you simply certainly can't see these differences: waiters, busboys, and cooks all have job security.
Part of the problem here is that temporary, short-term jobs in Europe have a very bad connotation.
To be sure, the little employment growth that has been seen recently in Europe has mostly been as a result of temporary jobs.
Even so, such jobs are widely regarded as a "plot" by companies seeking to fire employees at their leisure.
The fact that obstacles to short-term employment contracts lead to long-term unemployment traps is often forgotten.
Such perceptions reflect a deeper difference.
By and large, workers and management in Continental Europe retain many of the old class antagonisms that first emerged with the rise of industrialism in the 19
In the US, such sentiments are much less ingrained in the culture.
Leading 19
Yet beneath the surface, things are beginning to move in Europe.
Stealthily, the competition authorities of the European Commission are starting to get tougher on professional services (consider, for example, "Competition Policy and Liberal Professions," a statement that can be found on the European Commission's Web site, www.europa.eu.int ).
Once they have brought the cozy cartels of lawyers and accountants into line, other service industries seem destined to be opened up to greater competition, and hence to become great engines of job creation.
Notwithstanding Europe's labor unions, temporary jobs are starting to be accepted.
The American service industry job machine may be on its way across the Atlantic.
Capitalism's High Noon
Europe's Enron-induced schadenfreude is kaput.
Last year's Vivendi and this year's Parmalat scandals have seen to that.
Europe, like America - indeed, like the entire capitalist world - must now become more hawkish in demanding prosecution and punishment of bosses who loot their companies.
American prosecutors in the Enron case have made important progress lately, with some important crooks, like Andrew Fastow, offering both guilty pleas and a willingness to testify against their former colleagues.
Mr. Fastow will go to jail for ten years; those he testifies against will face even longer sentences.
Italian prosecutors seem zealous to make those who looted Parmalat pay a similar price.
But these cases go beyond the companies robbed and the shareholders betrayed.
What is at stake is no less than the perception of the fairness of the market and political support everywhere for market-oriented policies.
Capitalist economies produce inequality, often large ones.
Up to a point, and to the extent that income differences are due to differences in ability, effort, investment in education, etc., they are necessary to providing the correct incentives to invest, work, innovate, and grow.
But the more tainted the market's reputation for fairness, the more average citizens will see income differences merely as the result of corruption, illegal activities, connections with public officials, and so on.
This will increase demands for more regulation and heavy government involvement in the economy, so as to bring unruly and untrustworthy capitalists under greater control.
Moreover, the more that wealth accumulation is viewed as "unfair" (i.e., the result of corruption and illegality), the more pressure for stiff taxation of "ill-gotten gains" will mount.
If any of these populist measures would make markets fairer and better functioning, we would say, "So be it."
Unfortunately, reacting to corrupt businessmen in this way sets in motion a vicious circle: more regulation may lead to even more corruption in order to avoid it; higher taxes on wealth will bring about even more tax evasion, making the system even more tainted.
Sadly, nowadays, things as disparate as highly paid executives, the Enron and Parmalat scandals, contested mergers and acquisitions, stock market volatility, "junk bonds," and asset-price bubbles are all lumped together under the snide heading "cowboy capitalism."
Europeans are particularly prone to see things this way - and to see a powerful government as the sheriff to keep the cowboys from shooting up the town.
This is especially worrisome because Europe has recently begun moving in the right direction by deregulating its markets.
With political support for these changes still shaky, the risk is that opponents may use Parmalat, Enron, Vivendi, and other cases as an excuse to reverse the process.
In many developing countries, weak regulators and a widespread perception of corruption often stand in the way of pro-market reforms; the left (populist or otherwise) can credibly argue that capitalism is "corrupt" and so must be taken under the wing of the government.
This is a big reason why market capitalism has such a hard time taking root in the developing word.
If capitalists are corrupt, how can you convince a poor peasant to believe in the market economy?
He will vote for populist policies.
The result is even more corruption and less growth in a sort of "corruption-induced" poverty trap.
The Parmalat scandal may have been a blow to global capitalism, but in Italy it is hoped that it might sound the death knell for an economic system traditionally based much more on "connections" amongst private groups - and between these groups and the public sector - than on competitive markets.
For Italy, the obvious solution is to strengthen the country's investigative and financial institutions, and improve the design of regulatory agencies, particularly the quality of their personnel.
This, however, will not happen overnight, and in the meantime the demand for more regulation may result in a structure that is heavy, ineffective, and in the end impedes, rather than corrects, market forces.
Supervision inside Italian firms should be strengthened by making sure that a sufficient number of non-executive directors sit on the boards of public companies.
A single independent director would probably have been enough to blow the whistle at Parmalat: there were none on its board.
Similarly, it might help to have accounting firms be selected by minority shareholders or paid by the stock exchange, rather than by a company itself.
Here, even the recent changes in the US have not gone far enough: they prevent accounting firms from also serving as advisors to a firm, but they still leave the decision about remunerating the accountants in the hands of the company, thus creating a perverse incentive to play fast and loose with financial reporting.
It is surprising that while the Italian government is busy redesigning the regulatory and supervisory structure of the country's financial institutions and financial markets, nothing is being said about independent directors and accounting firms.
After all, good sheriffs need active citizens to be in their posses and to serve on juries.
Clean capitalism needs the same sort of widespread engagement.
It seems easier for white middle class Americans to consider the poor less worthy of government support if they think of them as different.
To put it crudely, but candidly, indifference comes easy if the poor are assumed to be mostly "black."
This is more difficult in Norway, where rich and poor are white, often blond and tall.
Much experimental and statistical evidence shows that individuals trust and associate more with others of the same race.
Precisely for this reason, political opportunists in the US have long used the race card to discredit welfare and redistribution, from the Jim Crow system that segregated blacks in the South before 1964 to the infamous Reagan-era charge about black "welfare queens" who drive Cadillacs.
Right wing white politicians, predisposed against taxes and redistribution, use the race issue to secure the votes of poor whites, who otherwise might vote differently on purely economic grounds.
Even more fundamentally, racial considerations also influence the nature of America's political institutions.
Proportional representation, widely adopted in Europe in the first decades of the 20th century, was never embraced by the US because it is a system that would allow black representatives to be elected regularly.
In Europe, however, socialist and communist parties imposed electoral systems based on proportional representation precisely because they open the door to representatives of minorities (the communists and socialists themselves).
The few American cities that introduced this system in the Progressive era, between 1910 and 1930, soon abandoned it - or were forced to - in order to stop the election of black representatives.
Today the only US city that uses proportional representation is the leftist bastion of Cambridge Massachusetts.
Proportional representation is widely viewed as one factor that promotes the implementation of redistributive policies by providing a political voice to minorities.
Cross-country evidence shows that the size of public redistributive spending increases with the degree of proportionality in the electoral system.
There is more.
Many redistributive programs in the US are run by the 50 states.
States that are more racially heterogeneous have smaller redistributive programs, even controlling for their level of income.
Welfare is relatively plentiful in the overwhelmingly white states of the North and Northwest (Oregon and Minnesota, to cite two examples) and in some states in New England (such as Vermont).
It is lacking in the racially mixed Southeast and Southwest.
Continental Europe is becoming, and will become, more ethnically mixed as more newcomers from Eastern Europe and the developing world arrive.
Xenophobic parties are on the rise across Europe; in some cases, they are in office.
Think of Jörg Haider and the late Pym Fortuyn, or, to a lesser extent, Italy's Northern League.
It will not be long before even Europe's more respectable conservative parties reach for rhetoric about "foreigners coming here to feast off of our taxes."
Simply put, when middle-class Europeans begin to think that a good portion of the poor are recent immigrants, their ingrained belief in the virtue of the welfare state will begin to waver.
Even Europe's leftist intelligentsia now associates crime and urban squalor with immigration.
The step from here to lamenting the high taxes spent on welfare for immigrants is a but a short one.
Melting Pot or Economic Meltdown
Worried about an invasion of migrant workers from the new member states of Central and Eastern Europe, the old EU members have erected high barriers in order to prevent the flow.
Despite the open market rhetoric of the EU, for most citizens of the new member states free labor mobility will not be a reality for the next seven years at least.
This is a politically understandable but flawed policy.
One of the key achievements of the European Union is mobility of goods and inputs.
Without this, what kind of a union would the EU be?
Otherwise, what, precisely, do the new countries get out of membership other than the nagging intrusions of the Brussels bureaucracy?
Given the high hopes that preceded ascension to the EU, and the stingy attitude of the Union to its new members, it should not surprise anyone if an anti-European reaction soon starts to brew in these countries.
So the cure is as bad as the disease: discrimination against the new members creates political problems of its own for the Union.
The real question is whether there is a disease at all.
Should Western Europe really be worried about an enormous flow of new immigrants?
In fact, estimates of potential migration flows from East to West are relatively small.
According to An agenda for a growing Europe , a report published by Oxford University Press in 2004 for the European Commission, 250,000 to 450,000 workers will go West during the first one to two years, followed by around 100,000 to 200,000 annually thereafter.
Over the first decade, the cumulative number of migrants might amount to between 1.5 and four million, that is, 2.4% to 5% of the total population in the new member states - and a tiny fraction of the total population in the current Union.
Aging populations and lower fertility rates in the new member states might result in even smaller flows.
There is another, less obvious, reason why the EU's policy on migration is flawed.
As Mircea Geoana, Romania's bright young Minister of Foreign Affairs, recently put it: "If the EU waits another seven or ten years before it opens up, the workers it will receive from my country will be the least qualified, peasants and individuals with low human capital: by then, the doctors, the architects and the engineers will all have migrated to the United States."
Indeed, this is precisely what happened with the Russians: the most qualified have already gone to the US.
Europe has been unable to attract much more than a few disreputable oligarchs, who migrated to the French Riviera, and a handful of lively street singers.
Western Europe is increasingly inhabited by aging populations that have lost the incentive and enthusiasm to work hard, take risks, and be ambitious.
Without an inflow of new blood and new ideas, the old Continent's economic future looks bleak.
Just look at the US: where would America be if it had introduced barriers to entry to various waves of new immigrants and remained confined to Anglo Saxon settlers?
To be sure, managing a melting pot is not easy, and many of America's social problems are related to difficult race relations.
But New York and Los Angeles, the two most ethnically diverse cities in the US, are also America's leaders in business and in the arts.
Nothing comes easy in this world: if the Union cannot manage a multicultural society in Europe, then it ought to prepare itself for permanent stagnation.
So long as the Union's borders remain closed, there is also a risk that foreign investment will fly over Western Europe and land in Central and Eastern Europe, where people are willing to work longer hours, market regulations are less intrusive, and human capital is relatively high, because Communist schools were good at technical training.
These countries have opened their markets to foreign investors - and foreign investors are responding eagerly.
Given Western Europe's growing need for labor in the years ahead, the question is not whether to have immigration, but only where that immigration is going to come from.
Will it be the legal immigration of easily assimilated people from Central and Eastern Europe, or illegal immigration from the Maghreb?
Europe on Holiday
Currently, the average number of hours worked per person aged 15 to 25 each year in France and Germany is about 50% lower than in the United States.
Other European countries (for example, Italy and Spain) fall somewhere between these poles.
Although some Americans always like to boast about their superior work ethic, this disparity in working hours between the US and Europe has not always existed.
Indeed, until the mid-1970's, the number of hours worked on either side of the Atlantic was roughly the same.
From the mid-1970's on, however, Americans continued working more or less the same number of hours, while Western Europeans began working less and less each year.
If Western Europe needs an explanation as to why its rate of economic growth is lagging behind the US, it need look no further.
The average number of working hours per person depends on a variety of factors:
• the level of participation in the labor force;
• the number of vacation days workers have;
• the number of hours worked in a "normal" week, i.e., with no vacation.
Virtually all the difference between the US on one side and France and Germany on the other are due to the first two factors, each with roughly equal weight.
So, lower participation in the labor force explains half of the difference, and longer vacations for those who do work accounts for the other half.
The importance of vacation time should come as no surprise to anyone who has experienced Europe's deserted cities in August, the three-week vacation "bridges" in April and May in France and Italy, the "rush hours" that take place every Friday at 2 PM in German cities, and crowded ski slopes in February due to winter school vacations.
But knowing "how" Europeans work less is one thing; knowing "why" Europeans work less than Americans is another.
One view is that Americans are perceived (and like to see themselves) as Calvinist workaholics, whereas Europeans like to think that they know how to enjoy life's pleasures.
As a European working in the US, I admit that I do take many more vacations than my American colleagues.
So there may be something in this "cultural" explanation.
But why did this start around 1973?
A second argument attributes the difference to income taxes, which, in fact, have increased significantly in Europe since the 1970's, while in the US income taxes fell from the early 1980's onward.
Income taxes certainly must affect willingness to work.
They may not change by much the number of hours worked by the main breadwinner in a family (typically a man), but they do influence the participation of women in the labor force.
After all, why work, when your after-tax salary barely pays for childcare and household help?
But even this is not a sufficient explanation, because studies of how the supply of labor responds to tax changes suggest that something else must explain the enormous gap between US and Europe, especially France and Germany.
For the age group over 50, the structure of pension systems is clearly a major factor.
It was and remains much more profitable to retire earlier in Europe than in the US.
Why should a Frenchman or Italian in his early sixties work today, when in the 1990's he could have retired in his mid-fifties with 80% or more of his last working-age salary?
For women, the retirement age in the mid-1990's was even lower.
Public sector employees had even more advantages.
Nor is that all.
In the 1980's and 1990's, many European labor unions, in response to rising unemployment, adopted the policy of "work less, work all."
In other words, they obtained shorter hours (i.e., more vacations) in order to keep employment up.
The problem is that total compensation did not go down in proportion to the shorter hours, thus leading to an increase in pay per hour.
Lower productivity and higher unit labor costs eroded firms' willingness to hire, leaving Europe with chronically higher unemployment than in the US.
Today's debates about growth in Europe are full of buzz words like "knowledge-based society," "technological progress," and "investment in education."
Europeans certainly need something to compensate for a short working life with many vacations.
But much of this discussion is merely a form of "political correctness."
It is more reassuring - and "feels better" - to tell Europeans that growth is sluggish because society is not sufficiently knowledge-based, rather than pointing to the trade-off between vacations and growth.
Europeans tend to prefer vacations over growth.
Personally, I love taking more and more vacations.
But I cannot (and do not) then complain if my income does not grow faster and faster.
The Productivity Gap
Year after year throughout the 1990's, Europe's productivity grew at a pace 18% slower than in the United States.
The European experience varied from country to country, but no one did better than the US.
By the end of the decade, Europe's productivity gap with the U.S. was 7% in Italy, 9% in France and 12% in the Netherlands, three relatively good cases, but a whopping 25% in Denmark, and 23% in the UK.
What explains these sharp differences?
An economy's productivity - that is, how much it produces per worker employed - depends on three factors: its endowment of capital, the quality of the country's workers and its ability to combine workers and capital efficiently to produce goods and services, what economists refer to as "total factor productivity." Availability of capital is not the explanation.
European firms have plenty of capital!
Indeed, European firms, probably in a response to rigid labor markets, have for at least twenty years been using technologies that are much more capital-intensive than that of US firms.
Capital intensity is 80% higher in Denmark than in the US, 60% higher in France, 50% in Italy, 40% in Germany.
Even in Spain, the endowment of capital per worker is 30% higher than in America.
The shift into labor-saving technologies shows no sign of reversal: since the mid 1980s the capital intensity of European firms has increased 6% relative to US firms.
To begin understand the differences between the US and Europe, look at the quality of the labor force.
The average number of years spent in school is a good indicator of a worker's quality, especially because improvements in output nowadays mostly arise from the ability to adopt new technologies.
The number of schooling years of the typical worker is 13% lower in Europe than in the US, ranging from 8% lower in the UK to 36% in Spain.
Where the gap with the US is most stunning is found in something called "total factor productivity."
Success in this area depends on two factors: technology - both the talent to innovate and the ability to adopt new production techniques - and organization.
Here Europe's performance is consistently below that of America: 30% on average, with the U.K. 43% and Germany 56% below the US.
Moreover, that disparity is growing over time: since the mid 1980s the gap has become 6% wider.
These data highlight two vital weaknesses in European firms.
The first is related to organization.
Rigid labor markets and a corporate governance culture that protects incumbent managers, make it hard to reap the benefits of new technologies.
At the 20
This exposes the second weakness: the ability to innovate.
As in the case of capital, what Europe lacks is not scientific competence, but the ability to translate scientific achievements into business innovations.
European scientific competence is not in question.
In 1999, for instance, European scientists published almost as many articles per head as their American-based colleagues.
Also the trend in the number of citations per article (an important indicator of research quality) is rising: +3% in Europe in the 1990's, while it remained flat in the US.
But European scientific competence does not translate into valuable business ideas - at least not as frequently as in the US - mostly because Europe's focus seems ill-directed.
European researchers register a large number of patents, but the number of patents (per million population) granted to innovations in high-tech fields is much smaller than in America: in 1998, 60% of all US patents were in high-tech fields, as opposed to 11% in Europe.
An important reason for this failure to translate knowledge into "action" lies in the lack of dynamic private universities.
Europe's obsession with public and standardized universities discourages competition in the R&D sectors and reduces the extent of a profitable relationship between higher education institutions and the world of entrepreneurs.
While in the 1990s American youths were inventing dotcoms in their garages, European youths spent years enjoying a worry-free, tuition-free and pampered life in publicly funded universities, paid for by taxpayers.
The Inevitability of Chinese Democracy
Fifteen years ago, Fang Hongin was protesting in Tienanmen Square.
A few years ago, in Beijing, he ran one of China's most popular TV shows, each week testing the limits of the authorities' indulgence.
Today, he runs Dragon TV, Shanghai's leading station, and advertisements featuring him hang from the city's skyscrapers.
Hu Shuli belongs to the same generation: the journalist whom the Economist magazine calls "China's most dangerous woman," moved from her first job, with the Party press, to editing Caijng , a business magazine that runs stories on corruption, exposing businessmen and public officials.
It would be a mistake, however, to interpret these experiments with a free press as signs that democracy in China is near. The Party allows Caijng to expose corruption because this helps it to stop China's most serious disease.
"The first civil right is getting out of poverty," says Yongtu Long, one of China's WTO negotiators. "In 15 years, we got 200 million people out of poverty; 700 million Chinese today have access to electricity, an unknown luxury 15 years ago.
This is why our priority is growth: everything else, frankly, is less important."
Growth, however, does only mean getting people out of poverty.
Twenty-five years ago, China had a more egalitarian society than Sweden; today there is vast inequality between city and countryside, between the western provinces and those bordering the Pacific ocean, and within cities, which attract a constant flow of former peasants looking for jobs.
Indeed, China's income distribution today looks more like that of Brazil than that of Sweden.
But more inequality also means more opportunities: becoming rich today in China remains very difficult, but it is no longer impossible - just walk into one of the pubs of downtown Shanghai.
Inequality can be accepted, but not if it is the fruit of corruption, and this remains China's foremost social problem, which the Party has been unable to eradicate, despite Caijng 's exposés and the death penalty.
Can China really do without democracy?
A few years ago, Fareed Zakaria, then an editor of Foreign Affairs , argued against the priority normally given to democracy, simply defined as the possibility of choosing political leaders through free elections.
The world is full of democracies, he argued, that routinely violate human rights. "Elections are of little use if democratically elected governments limit the freedom of the press and the independence of the judiciary."
"There is certainly more freedom in Shanghai than in Moscow," says a professor from Tsinghua University in Beijing, echoing Zakaria.
She is probably right, although India reminds us that sometimes elections are a powerful and effective mechanism to correct the path a country has taken.
India's economy is growing almost as fast as China's, with a similar increase in inequality and, to some extent, corruption.
But Indian voters have turned against this model.
As a result, India's economy is likely to slow.
It is hard to tell whether this is good or bad.
It is probably bad in the short run, but who knows about the longer term?
The point is that questions such as, "Are we creating too much inequality?" cannot even be asked in China.
The upshot is that whenever a problem gets out of hand, the turnaround comes too late and is dramatic.
This is why China cannot shelve the problem of its transition to democracy.
Democracy is not only a mechanism to help prevent strategic mistakes.
There is a more mundane reason why many, even within the Party, think that a democratic transition has become inevitable: the Party is simply losing control of the country.
Deng Xiaoping was the last Chinese leader to possess undisputed authority to decide on public policy.
Today, the Party's political bureau has more than 20 members and each resolution requires unanimity.
More important decisions require an even larger consensus, involving up to 3,000 people.
For example, the Party's main current activity is drafting the documents that will be approved at the next congress, scheduled for the autumn of 2007.
The difference between the economy's pace and that of the Party means that the country increasingly runs on its own.
As in the past, when a dynasty weakens, the provinces make their own decisions.
Even slowing the economy is hard: lacking an efficient financial system, credit growth must be controlled directly through banks.
But the director of the Guangzhou office of China Construction Bank, China's largest, consults with the party leader of his province before executing the directives he receives from the bank's head office in Beijing.
Considering these difficulties, some inside the Party admit that "there is only one way forward: let someone be in charge, no matter how she or he is chosen, even through an election, provided effective decision-making is restored."
So China's democratic transition may be closer than anyone realizes.
But if it happens, it will not result from grassroots democratic experiments in towns and villages; rather, it will be an elite-driven transition, careful to preserve the government's control.
This is the only condition under which the People's Liberation Army and the all-powerful Military Commission will accept democratization.
Is the European Union imploding?
The prospect of being accepted into the EU provided the nations of Eastern and Central Europe with a strong incentive to achieve fiscal balance - a process somewhat similar to what happened in Western Europe at the time the euro was launched.
In both cases, however, after initial progress, countries have shown clear signs of political "fatigue": in the euro area, the Stability Pact has imploded; throughout Eastern Europe, budget deficits have started to rise.
In the Czech Republic last year, the budget deficit jumped to 13% of GDP, a threefold increase since 1999.
Although this included a one-time charge for bank restructuring costs, this year the deficit will close above 6% of GDP.
In Poland, the deficit is also moving close to 6% of GDP, up from 2.9% in 2001.
In Hungary the budget deficit is widening again, after narrowing to 4% of GDP in 2001.
Malta, too, has a deficit close to 10% of GDP, up four percentage points since 2001.
Only the Baltic countries seem able to maintain sound fiscal policies.
In many ways, this is not surprising: once politicians no longer face annual EU progress reports - and the threat of exclusion - fiscal relaxation becomes much less costly.
At the same time, the big euro area members (France and Germany) do not have a leg to stand on to criticize other countries' fiscal policies, so there are virtually no international constraints on EU countries' budget deficits.
Indeed, these constraints have proven to be utterly useless after a country's EU entry, and it will be hard to impose them as an admission criterion for other potential entrants.
Perhaps more surprising is the apparent political backlash against the governments that have led countries into the EU.
Once again the similarity with what happened in Western Europe at the time of the euro's implementation is striking.
The government of Romano Prodi, having managed against all the odds to get Italy into Europe's monetary union, fell three months later.
The Czech Republic, Poland, and Hungary have each endured a government crisis since EU accession.
Throughout Central and Eastern Europe, the EU is not as popular as it used to be.
Voter turnout in the European Parliament elections in June was embarrassingly low in the new accession countries, ranging from just 17% in Slovakia to 38.5% in Hungary.
Participating in their first-ever EU election, citizens in these countries turned out at a rate not only well below the European average (about 45%), but even below the UK average.
The reasons are twofold.
Accession countries felt that they were asked to make major fiscal adjustments in order to be accepted into the EU.
Regardless of whether such policies were in the long-term interest of these countries, in the short run they were politically costly.
This "adjustment fatigue," a term coined to describe the experience of Latin American countries to economic liberalization in the 1990's, is now coupled with the feeling that the EU is not such a great bargain after all.
Perhaps most visible has been Western European countries' eagerness to protect their labor markets against migration from Central and Eastern Europe - a sticking point that always comes up in every meeting between politicians from the West and the East.
Little wonder, then, that voters in Central and Eastern Europe now feel that they got a poor bargain from the governments that brought them in: belt tightening, labor market restrictions, and the notorious barrage of EU regulation.
The result has been a reaction against these governments and a lack of public interest in EU affairs.
So, after all the celebrations of European enlargement, we are left with a predictable set of problems: a "union" of countries with very different views on everything (from foreign policy to labor market policies) and different economic interests; widespread disillusionment among voters in the new member states; a constitutional process whose future is uncertain; and all the usual political wrangling in Brussels between countries seeking to get as much power as possible.
The Long Decline of Western Europe?
It's election season in Germany, France and Italy, so the time for structural reforms is over.
Paradoxically, this could be good news for those who think that Europe should start contributing to world growth by expanding domestic demand.
In fact, the current wisdom has it that the reason why France recently grew twice as fast as Germany is that French consumers have stopped worrying about social reforms.
As soon as French Finance Minister Nicolas Sarkozy decided to leave the government and start campaigning for the presidency, incumbent President Jacques Chirac abandoned all plans for reforms that might antagonize voters.
So health reform or even partial pension reform must wait a few years.
At the same time, a recent "white paper" produced by a working group headed by the IMF's former boss, Michel Camdessus, which was charged with proposing the type of structural reforms needed to achieve growth, was received with the usual outcry from trade unions.
Most of its reasonable proposals will soon become another example of forgotten good intentions.
Back to business as usual in France.
German households, on the other hand, according to a recent poll published in the influential daily, Die Welt , are in a more sober mood: most plan on cutting down their vacation travel -- which, obviously, does not mean that they will work more; they will just spend some of the many weeks of their paid leisure at home -- and postponing large item purchases.
Why?
They are worried by the talk of pension reform, changes in the health system, and new eligibility rules for unemployment benefits.
To be sure, their mood may soon turn brighter: Chancellor Schröder is also preparing for re-election.
He may even have a shot at winning, as the SDP, his party, is reviving in the polls.
Accordingly, references to the need for pushing ahead with reforms have disappeared from his speeches.
As a result, perhaps the long-awaited turnaround in German consumption -- which has been flat for the good part of a decade -- is about to happen.
In Italy, Prime Minister Berlusconi waited three and a half years before deciding to deliver on his main electoral promise of a tax cut.
But real tax cuts also mean spending cuts and, as elections loom barely a year from now, it is too late.
Concerned that cutting spending might lose him votes, Berlusconi is proposing a tax cut of less that 0.3% of GDP -- and one that is partly to be financed by other levies.
If Germans are depressed, Italians are in a coma.
There is a lesson to be drawn from these experiences.
Europeans don't really want reforms, and politicians are very aware of this.
Or, to put it differently, special interests have become so powerful and entrenched that any attempt at reform brings out a powerful lobby against it.
So politicians on the campaign trail promise the impossible: reforms that will produce instant prosperity at no cost to anyone.
When -- surprise, surprise! -- this turns out to be impossible, they give up on reform altogether.
In the meantime, they do serious damage because Europeans are so worried about the possibility of reform that the mere possibility of such reforms actually being enacted plunges them into a funk.
In fact, there are two problems with all this talk and little or no real action on structural reforms.
First, it makes consumers anxious and depresses demand.
Second, it leaves time for anti-reform lobbies to organize and prevent any progress toward completion of the reform effort.
A politically more successful plan would be to adopt the "big bang" approach: implement quickly a broad set of reforms that will break the opposition of special interests and leave enough time before the next election for the benefits of reform to be felt by voters.
When consumers see the benefits of market deregulation, for example, perhaps they will feel compensated for having to work longer for their retirement.
But no European politician on the horizon is likely to take this approach.
Does this mean that Europe -- at least continental Western Europe -- is doomed?
Not necessarily.
Germany, France, and Italy are rich countries.
Even without reforms, they will be able to afford a civilized form of life for many years to come.
To be sure, eventually they will become poor relative to other, faster growing economies.
But after all, it took Argentina nearly a century of mismanagement to go from almost the top of per capita income to its relative poverty today.
The Reform Game
Reform, when long discussed but never implemented, can do far more harm than good.
Anticipation of a reform -- say, of pension rules, the health system, or unemployment benefits -- worries everyone who might feel the impact.
In response, they cut consumption and save more, expecting that sooner or later they will have to start paying for some of the services they had been used to getting free or at subsidized rates.
But because reform in Europe is usually only discussed, the benefits fail to materialize: people work harder only when they are sure that tax rates are actually cut, and in financial markets the positive effects of lower government spending do not come before any reform is approved.
In the meantime, as politicians debate and do nothing, consumer confidence falls, economic performance worsens, and the consensus needed to get reforms approved in the first place vanishes.
Still the talk does not stop, nor does the fall in consumer confidence.
Germany's recent experience provides a worrying example of this vicious circle.
Reform of Germany's generous social system has claimed the front pages for German papers for more than ten years.
Some timid measures have been implemented, but the general feeling among Germans is best described by the following answer to a survey conducted two months ago by the newspaper Die Welt : "47% of those interviewed plan to cut consumption due to the uncertainty about pensions and health reform."
The result has been a sharp fall in consumer confidence: the German index of consumer sentiment was small but positive in November 2000; it has since fallen to -20, the sharpest decline in the euro area.
Out on the street, pessimism runs rampant.
For two years now, the growth rate of private consumption (measured at constant prices) has been negative: - 1% in 2002, -0.5% in 2003.
Similar declines in real consumption are rare in industrial countries, as in bad years consumers typically draw on their savings to keep their consumption relatively constant.
In the case of Germany, one has to go back to the early 1980's to see similar negative numbers in consumption growth.
As a result, rather than falling, the household saving rate has increased, rising from 9.7% of disposable income in 2000 to 11.8% last year.
Depressed consumption and higher savings have affected all age groups, but the relatively old have been more prone to the trend than the relatively young.
The only positive signs in consumption are seen among the youngest households, those headed by people in their early twenties, who evidently hope that sooner or later the reforms will be approved and their tax burden reduced.
But the saving rate even in households in their thirties has risen along with concern about reforms.
Not surprisingly, elderly people cut consumption more.
With retirement, they have lost almost all options: they can no longer work more, nor can they sign up for private health plans -- the insurance premiums at their age are too high.
So they are forced to rely on their savings, and virtually stop consuming.
Put this in the context of a rapidly aging population and the effects on overall consumption are dramatic.
Interestingly, France is the only large Euro area country where consumer confidence is growing (from -24 a year ago to -13 today).
The reason is simple: as the 2006 elections approach, reforms have been shifted off the political agenda.
If a government does not have the will to adopt a reform program, then the best thing it can do is stop talking about reform altogether.
This may start happening in Germany and for the same reason: consumer confidence remains lackluster.
Europe's economy grew at an anemic 1.8% annual rate in 2004, and the OECD has recently revised downward its growth forecast for next year, from 2.5 to 1.9%, owing to the rising euro and the fall in exports -- so far the only driver of the euro area economies.
The common wisdom is that to faster European growth requires a boost from domestic demand.
But this will not happen as long as politicians keep talking about reforms, while doing virtually nothing to realize them.
On the contrary, all they are doing is spreading pessimism.
Europe has two ways ahead.
It can forget about reform and enjoy the four or five decades it will take for its per capita income to fall below the level of, say, Chile, or it can deeply change its social model and start growing like the US.
Doing nothing but talking, which is Europe's current model of inaction, is the worst possible course.
In fact, more aid is likely to increase corruption, because it augments the amount of resources over which elites fight.
The same goes for debt forgiveness: it only encourages countries to borrow more, often for the benefit of local elites.
A recent widely cited book by William Easterly - a former economist at the World Bank and an expert on aid and development - provides a mountain of shocking stories about local elites squandering foreign assistance.
The pro-aid coalition should read it carefully.
Those who really care about reducing poverty should place blame where it belongs: with governments and bureaucracies in many developing countries, especially in Africa and Latin America.
Traditionally, instead, foreign aid paid no attention to the virtues of the receiving countries and did not discriminate in favor of "good governments."
Donors have typically favored their former colonies, irrespectively of the nature of their regimes.
One of the worst offenders here is France.
Statistical evidence shows that a hypothetical former colony of France, following hideous policies, with dictatorial and objectionable regimes, would receive much more aid from France than a non-former colony struggling and trying to adopt decent polices.
In other words, France gives almost exclusively to its former colonies, irrespective of how bad their regimes are.
Aid given by the US has been overly influenced by Middle East politics and, previously, by the Cold War.
Political alliances, indeed, are often more important than the quality of the receiving countries policies as a determinant of the direction of aid giving.
The only donors that directed their aid reasonably well are the Scandinavian countries, whose aid giving is the highest in per capita terms but small as a percentage of the total.
One of the reasons is that these countries did not have colonies and political alliances to support.
Before providing more aid or debt forgiveness two conditions need to be met.
One is "institutional conditionality:" only governments that show serious progress in reducing inefficiency, robbery of public property and corruption, should receive aid.
Latin America's Never-Ending Story
Here we go again.
Latin America is in deep trouble and the usual suspects (the IMF, the US Treasury) have come to the rescue.
The world has seen all of this many times before.
Thirty years of macroeconomic upheaval in Latin America can be boiled down to a simple lesson: governments throughout the region are too large compared with their ability to raise revenue through normal types of taxation.
Until this vital issue is solved, crises will be the norm, because the fundamental economic choice these countries face will continue to be one between raising revenue through inflation or letting debt grow.
The typical cycle -- Argentina offers a perfect example -- is one where inflation is allowed to rise for a period.
With this, tax receipts grow while debt remains stable.
But over time, people learn to live with high inflation and insulate the economy from its effects, thus reducing the revenues gained by the "inflation tax."
At this point, government revenues fall, the benefits from high inflation vanish, and political support for stabilization consolidates.
Stabilization is typically followed by a short honeymoon.
Eventually, however, with inflation lowered and high levels of public spending unchanged, debt starts to grow again.
A new crisis beckons.
The exchange rate is devalued.
Some debts are repudiated and high inflation rates (and the inflation tax) return, both of which help balance the budget.
Over the 1990s, Argentina tried to tie its hands against such policies by instituting a currency board.
The Argentine currency board is mocked nowadays, but it was a smart idea.
Had Argentina's budget been truly balanced, the currency board would have worked.
Instead, Argentina never balanced its budget, not even the budget net of interest payments on its debt.
Throughout these macroeconomic cycles poverty fluctuates.
Across South America there is an almost perfect correlation between the revenue gained from the inflation tax and various measures of poverty, because the poor are the least able to protect themselves from the inflation tax.
In Argentina, during the stabilization of the early 1990's, when inflation fell from 1000% per month to zero in a few weeks, the number of poor people was cut in half.
This explains why the first government of President Carlos Menem enjoyed vast popularity.
It also helps us understand why Menem is now running ahead of other candidates in the polls for next year's presidential elections: along with rising inflation, the number of poor is rising fast too.
Contrary to what critics of the IMF, such as Joe Stiglitz, say, abandoning the "Washington Consensus" will hurt the poor.
In his recent vitriolic attacks on the IMF Stiglitz implied that he cares for the poor while the IMF does not.
Well, the data contradicts him: using policies that he directly or indirectly advocates -such as using deficits first and inflation later to solve fiscal problems - is especially bad for the poor.
Raising "normal" tax revenue remains an unrealistic option in most Latin American countries.
What prevents normal taxation is lax tax enforcement, due to corrupt public administrations and a bourgeoisie with a well-developed culture of tax evasion.
Latin America's rich and middle classes are particularly adept at shifting their wealth to tax havens at the slightest sign that tax collection may become tougher.
Take Brazil.
Brazil has been more successful than Argentina in raising tax revenues.
Since its 1999 stabilization, the budget net of interest payments has constantly shown a surplus, now as high as 3.8% of GDP.
This surplus, however, has not come from reduced spending, but from a set of inefficient and distortionary taxes, mostly on financial transactions.
The real issue in Brazil today is not whether a 3.8% primary surplus is sufficient to keep the debt stable, but whether the economy can survive its burden of distortionary taxes.
Brazil's government seems to lack the capacity to raise income taxes on the wealthy, which is outrageous given the country's level of inequality.
The election of a populist politician in the coming presidential election will not change this.
No surprise, then, that financial markets are worried.
Domingo Cavallo, Menem's economic guru, saw through all this, and concluded that the only way out was to reduce the size of government drastically.
If raising income taxes to the standard of industrial economies is impossible, then you must accept a lower level of public services: hence his radical privatization program of the early 1990's, hence his assault on public sector employees and their European-style salaries and benefits.
Argentina's currency board was set up to block recourse to that old easy option, the inflation tax.
It should be no surprise that the country found a way to rid itself of Cavallo and bring back its old populist politicians.
Latin America does not need financial engineering.
To argue that Latin America's problems are due to IMF mistakes is superficial at best.
The problem of Latin America lies in its high level of government spending, the lack of a solid upper and middle class ready to pay taxes to support it, and the inability to produce politicians able to use tax revenues prudently and so break the cycle of populist demagoguery.
We plan to store this column carefully.
Sadly, we will be able to use it again, with no change, at the next round of Latin American crises.
Divided Europe Stands
In coming meetings of the G8 (the world's club of rich industrial countries plus Russia), four members--Germany, France, Italy, and the UK--will participate both individually and as members of the European Union, whose President also attends to represent the EU as a whole.
But shouldn't the EU have only a single representative?
Regardless of whether these meetings are productive, unitary EU participation would be of supreme symbolic value: it would affirm a common European stance in international relations and international economic policy.
The main argument in favor of such a change is that joint participation by the EU would increase Europe's weight in international relations, especially vis-a-vis the US.
After all, a key reason for European integration in the first place was precisely to provide a more powerful voice for Europe in the international arena.
The EU's member countries share strict rules on fiscal policy, a common currency (except, for the moment, the UK, Sweden, and Denmark), a common trade policy, a common antitrust policy, and common market polices, just to name a few.
So why not having a single representative at the G8 meetings.
Indeed, Germany, France, Italy, and the UK basically share a common stance on international economic policy, so why not present a united front to the world where these issues are concerned?
There are two possible answers.
One is that despite occasional shows of unity, European countries retain very different views on foreign policy and do not want to delegate this prerogative.
Consider, for example, the recent strained relationship with the US.
Although the UK remains very close to its transatlantic ally, France is extremely critical, regardless of the color of its government.
Italy's position, on the other hand, pivots 180 degrees depending on who is in power.
Germany has recently taken a more anti-American stance (perhaps for electoral reasons), but it is beginning to like flexing its independent foreign-policy muscles.
The risk is that agreeing on a common foreign policy would either be impossible or would lead to the adoption of a minimum common denominator that would leave Europe ineffective and weak.
Alternatively, taking a strong position based on, say, majority voting within the EU may lead to very strained relations between member states.
The European Union may soon have 25, or more, members.
Agreeing upon a united foreign policy will become even more difficult, if not downright impossible.
Reaching a consensus on relatively small diplomatic and international issues may be feasible, but suppose that America pushes forward militarily against Iraq, after consultation with the European allies seeking their approval.
It is very plausible that, even here, agreement on how to respond to the US request would be impossible.
In fact, profound disagreements on foreign policy among EU members represent one of the main reasons why the EU can not and should not become a federal state in the traditional sense.
Indeed, perhaps foreign policy should not be one of the policy areas delegated and agreed upon by all EU members.
In a more general sense, can such a united policy ever be "fair" in global terms.
Estonia once it joins the EU will be represented at the G8 meeting, while, say Korea will have no voice simply because it is not a member of the common market and single currency union?
Obviously the role of Estonia in deciding the position of the EU representative at G8 meeting would be small, but, again, its participation would be a matter of symbols more than substance.
The second answer is more cynical.
Perhaps the heads of states of the four European countries would lose a major photo opportunity and have no inclination to delegate it to a representative of the EU.
The different preferences and policy choices among existing members in some areas, especially foreign policy, are very deep and in all likelihood will remain so.
These differences are also likely to multiply and become more pronounced in an enlarged Europe.
There is, indeed, a trade-off between EU enlargement and deepening of policy coordination.
This is an important point that seems to be missed in the current European debate about institution building and constitution writing.
The cynical answer about photo opportunities may or may not be correct.
But it underscores that decisions about what to delegate to the EU are often the result of short-sighted conflicts between national and European bureaucracies rather than the product of a carefully thought-out institutional design.
These are some of the key questions that the European constitutional convention has to address.
So far it has offered precious few answers.
Europe's Destabilizing Stability Pact
Europe's Growth and Stability Pact is under threat as never before.
Even European Commission President Romano Prodi now calls it "stupid."
In many ways, he may not be wrong.
Last summer, as soon as it became clear that Germany's mounting budget deficit might exceed the Stability Pact's ceiling, Chancellor Schröeder postponed a tax cut he had already announced rather than cut public spending.
The French government, unwilling to cut its swollen public sector, is now thumbing its nose at the Stability Pact and its enforcers in the European Commission, saying that it has "different priorities" than those required by the pact.
The question now is whether or not the Stability Pact can long survive the antagonism of the EU's two biggest economies.
The Stability Pact emerged after a long period (part of the 1970s, all of the 1980s, and a good portion of the 1990s) during which many European countries lost control of their fiscal balances.
The Stability Pact initially sought to force countries that wished to join European Monetary Union to bring their budgets closer into balance and to slash excess debt.
Now, however, its built-in flaws are being revealed.
The biggest problem concerns the fact that the Stability Pact focuses on a country's budget deficit, rather than on the component parts of government budgets: taxes and public spending.
Europe's fiscal problems have their roots in governments that are too big and that require, in order to pay for their bloated size, levels of taxation which grossly interfere with the incentives individuals need to work harder, invest more, and run entrepreneurial risks.
Setting a limit on a country's overall budget deficit - as the Stability Pact does - cannot correct this distortion.
Between 1995 and 2002, notwithstanding the Stability Pact, total public spending in the euro area (net of interest and of capital spending) remained virtually unchanged: it amounted to 41% of the euro zone's GDP in 1995; it will amount to 40.7% of GDP this year.
Meanwhile, gross government investment, already minuscule, contracted even further: from 2.7% to 2.4% of GDP.
As a result of the Stability Pact, teeny differences in budget outcomes acquire a prominence in Europe's economic policy debate that is not only ridiculous on their face, but distract attention from Europe's real budgetary problems.
Few people seem aware of the margin of error that exists when computing such numbers.
It is not uncommon, say, for parliamentary discussions about a budget to turn on the question of whether or not such an such an action will lead to a deficit of 0.8 or 1.1% of GDP-blithely unconcerned that the difference between those numbers is well below the statistical margin of error.
Futile debates of this type are a handy excuse for a country to avoid facing its real fiscal challenges: unsustainable pensions, unemployment benefits that discourage workers from looking for a new job, public sector wage bills unrelated to productivity.
In addition to shifting Europe's focus from its real budget challenges, the Stability Pact is indiscriminate - ie, it treats both high and low-debt countries in the same way.
Greece and Italy, whose total public debt exceeds 100% of annual GDP are treated in the same manner as Portugal, where the debt-to-GDP ratio is around 45%.
Such equivalence neglects the reason why the Stability Pact was created in the first place - to compel the most heavily indebted governments to put their fiscal house in order.
The third destabilizing factor built into the Stability Pact is the fact that it virtually invites governments to engage in creative, Enron-style accounting - ie, it encourages governments to cheat.
Changing the composition of the public debt, for instance issuing consols rather than bonds that pay a coupon, is often sufficient to lower the official deficit by a few decimal points, and this is only one in a finance minister's large black bag of tricks.
Europe desperately needs lower spending, especially on pensions and wages, and lower taxes.
Clearly, the Stability Pact cannot deliver the incentives needed to achieve these goals.
In fact, it may interfere with the one realistic way to reduce the size of government: cut taxes first, get European taxpayers accustomed to a lower burden, then create political incentives to reduce spending.
By remaining obsessed about the first decimal point of a deficit, even in a time of prolonged stagnation, Ecofin (the Council of European finance ministers) misses both the point of its mission, restraining the most profligate of government debtors, and the big picture about bringing growth to Europe.
In the end, if a European country, especially one of the EU's big four of Germany, France, Italy and the UK, wants to run a deficit that exceeds the strictures of the Stability Pact, it will do so with impunity, as France is doing now.
Two years into the euro's life, the Stability Pact that underpins the currency serves only the purpose of beating up on small countries (remember what happened to Ireland, which has as virtuous a budget balance as any country in Europe but which dared lower taxes against the Stability Pact's rules?).
It is time for a change in how the European Commission thinks, for less of an obsession with deficits and more attention to government spending.
Mario Monti on Trial
Mario Monti, the European Union's Commissioner for Competition Policy, is often in the spotlight, usually to popular acclaim.
Over the years, he has won important victories limiting state aid to business, one of Europe's most pernicious economic maladies.
Today, however, the benefits derived from his achievements are at risk because of a series of stunning courtroom defeats.
With a competition case against software giant Microsoft seemingly in the offing, Commissioner Monti will need to rediscover his footing fast.
Within a period of just a few weeks, the European Court of Justice (to which private parties can appeal decisions made by the Commission) voided three of Monti's decisions rejecting proposed corporate mergers.
While the two issues, state aid and private mergers, are in principle separate, losing repeatedly on one battlefield undermines Monti's position elsewhere, particularly the battle against state aid.
The Court's rulings against Monti's decisions are devastating.
In the Schneider/Legrand steel merger case, it cites "several obvious errors, omissions and contradictions in the Commission's economic reasoning" as well as a "procedural irregularity which constitutes an infringement of defense rights."
The Tetra Laval case saw the Court denounce Monti's "economic analysis of the immediate anti-competitive effects," which it said was "based on insufficient evidence and some errors of assessment."
Finally, in the Airtours merger case, the Court rebuked the competition authorities for "decisions that are vitiated by errors" concerning issues that are "fundamental to any determination of the question of the creation of a collective dominant position."
Worsening the injustice, in at least one case the Court's decision came too late for the companies involved to go ahead with their plans.
These cases raise important questions about both the substance and procedures of the European Commission's handling of competition policy.
Start with the substance.
The Court's verdicts leave the impression that competition policy in Europe is overly zealous.
That condemnation matters, because passing judgment on the trade-off between the efficiency gains to be had from any merger versus the threat to competition is a subtle matter, not an ideological one.
In the Airtours/First Choice case, the Court ruled that the Commission failed to prove that the three leading tour operators, if merged, "would have an incentive to cease competing with each other."
The Court rejected the Commission's conclusion that the merger would enable them "to interpret each other's business strategies more easily and to adopt those strategies themselves."
Moreover, the Commission "failed to identify or demonstrate clearly" how the merged operators would enforce any "common policy."
Finally, the Commission "underestimated" competitors' ability to react to "any attempted restriction of capacity," either by increasing supply or by entering "the relevant market quickly."
The Tetra Laval-Sidel case is particularly interesting because it shows the extent to Monti's team tends to second-guess private companies.
The Competition Commission started from the premise that the current overlaps in the packaging markets will grow in the medium to long term.
It then concluded that Tetra Laval, from its strong dominant position in the carton container market, will probably pressure its current customers wishing to switch over to PET packaging to use equipment produced by Sidel when they make that switch.
The Court agreed, in principle, that the merger could allow such leveraging to occur, but it found that the Commission did not prove that the merged entity would have an incentive to use this possibility.
We are confident that Monti's office could answer the Court's criticisms and that reasonable people can disagree on the subtleties of whether these mergers threaten competition enough to be rejected.
But our point is different.
Rather than putting proposed mergers by private companies under the microscope, Commissioner Monti should focus on his other mandate: safeguarding against state intervention and state aid to companies.
In other words, Monti should think hard about redirecting his limited resources to the right battlefield.
To be sure, we are not arguing that Commissioner Monti should forget about the fight to make European product markets more competitive.
In most European cities, taxi drivers are protected by limits on the number of licenses; the number of notary publics in many countries is similarly restricted, and the price of their services-which are typically of little economic value, but inescapable under existing administrative procedures -- correspondingly high.
These are important battles, and they are very close to citizens' hearts.
But, like the fight against subsidies to businesses, these are battles that are directed against state intervention, not private companies.
The question of procedures concerns constitutional design.
In the area of competition policy the Commission is, at least in the first instance, both prosecutor and judge.
The Commission is authorized to open a case against a proposed merger and to decide on it.
The parties involved can appeal to the European Court of Justice, but this takes time and a reversal of the Commission's decision typically produces no more than a moral victory to one of the parties.
The time of the merger may have come and gone, as was the case in the Airtours/First Choice decision.
A division of responsibility between prosecutor and judge is a critical constitutional guarantee for private litigation.
Competition policy in the United States is based upon this principle.
It is one that Europe would do well to put into practice.
Former President Giscard d'Estaing and the European Convention, please take note.
The Stealth Threat to World Trade
Threats to world trade come in many guises.
The usual suspects include protectionist barriers and militant anti-globalization protests of the type that derailed the "Millennium Round" of World Trade Organization (WTO) talks in Seattle last year.
Although these protests grab headlines, a new and perhaps even more insidious threat to world trade has quietly taken shape over recent years: so called "open sectoralism," or the practice of negotiating access to foreign markets on a selective, industry-by-industry basis.
What this practice entails is that countries negotiate lower tariffs on some types of products but not on others.
Contrary to appearances, open sectoralism is not a first step to more comprehensive trade agreements.
Indeed, it may prevent wider agreements from being negotiated.
For even when successfully negotiated, sectoral agreements jeopardize economic efficiency and performance by protecting the least competitive industries because each country tries to open trade in areas where it is competitive.
No country likes to open its manufacturing dinosaurs to foreign competition.
The economic implications of such a stance, however, are perverse.
Imagine an America or Europe still stuck in the 1950s, with economies dependent on coal and steel, and textiles, and with no competition from cheaper producers in Asia and elsewhere, and the danger becomes obvious.
A second danger arises from the fact that, by liberalizing trade for only a few economically successful industries, open sectoralism weakens, rather than strengthens, the broad political support needed for the comprehensive global trade agreements that benefit most businesses, consumers, and countries.
America is the keenest supporter of open sectoralism, beginning several years ago with the "zero-for-zero" tariff negotiations during the Uruguay Round of world trade talks.
Those talks led ultimately to the dismantling of tariff barriers in ten key sectors.
Pushed by business, the US negotiated sectoral agreements in telecoms, information technology, and financial services.
The first major deal, the Information Technology Agreement (ITA), took effect in 1997 and covers 90% of trade in IT products worth more than $600 billion annually.
The ITA was subsequently backed by the European Union after Hugo Paemen, the EU ambassador to the US, saw the ITA as proof that sectoral agreements help circumvent mounting political resistance to new trade rounds.
With the support of the two most powerful actors in world trade, the ITA model has been pursued ever since in other sectors.
A Global Agreement on Basic Telecommunications went into effect in 1998; a Financial Services Agreement to liberalize trade in banking, insurance, and securities was implemented in April 1999.
Such agreements, which often dismantle not only tariffs but other regulatory barriers, may appear unassailable.
But looks deceive.
Because the powerful sectoral interests that supported liberalization during the Uruguay Round -- information technology, financial services, telecommunications -- now have their own deals, the energy they once brought to the cause of broader trade liberalization has diminished sharply.
Indeed, the Japanese believe that the halfhearted backing of US business groups for a new round of WTO talks reflects the success of the earlier sectoral agreements. So Japan now opposes negotiating a second ITA, which it fears will further weaken political support for broad trade liberalization.
Fears for the future of comprehensive, multi-sector trade negotiations are well founded.
Continuing effort by US officials, for example, to focus narrowly on trade in services and agriculture impedes wider agreements by limiting the tradeoffs that can be made among sectors.
Moreover, a sector-by-sector approach invariably ignores a host of issues within the WTO, such as dispute settlement, anti-dumping, and the like.
The recent experience of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum highlights the limitations of open sectoralism and should prompt a thorough re-appraisal.
Following the launch of the ITA, America pressed APEC's members for accelerated liberalization on a sectoral basis as a means to revive a stalled regional trade agenda.
But efforts to reach an agreement to liberalize trade in 15 sectors soon faltered: the cost of selective liberalization in uncompetitive, but politically sensitive, sectors was simply too high for some governments to bear.
The most important lesson of APEC's failure is a recognition of the enormous difficulty found in constructing a broad enough, and yet politically acceptable, package when trade negotiations are limited to particular beneficiaries.
Because some industries no longer care about wide trade agreements because they have already benefited through a sectoral deal, the groups that normally see themselves as gaining from greater trade openness are too weak to offset the political influence of protectionist forces mobilized against liberalization.
Policymakers who are now attracted to open sectoralism because of its delusive promise of frictionless politics should take that lesson to heart.
If the full benefits of trade liberalization are to be gained quickly, there is no alternative to resuming comprehensive negotiations -- and the tradeoffs between industries that this strategy entails -- by reviving the WTO's Millennium Round.
It is this agenda, rather than the hollow hope of open sectoralism, that should be the main priority of trade negotiators in the future.
Make or Break for Europe's Constitution
The challenge for the EU now is to refocus itself on the priorities of today and tomorrow.
It needs to connect better with its own citizens, to renew their support by showing that Europeans working together can foster growth and jobs, fight international crime, and secure a clean environment.
The Union needs to play a more active role in the wider world, not in pursuit of selfish interests, but in promoting the universal values on which it is founded.
Most of all, the enlarged Union needs a constitutional and institutional framework that fits its ambitions.
For thirty months, governments and parliamentarians have been working on a new constitution for Europe.
An exceptional draft was prepared by the convention chaired by former French President Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
It is the task of national governments - of me and my colleagues in the European Council - to finish the job.
We meet in Brussels this week, and our overriding priority is to reach agreement on the constitution.
Consensus on most of the draft has existed for some time.
There is no dispute about the EU's values and objectives, about inclusion of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, or about simplifying legislative processes.
These are all major advances.
But national governments inevitably have a particular interest in the powers of EU institutions in such key areas as foreign policy, criminal law, and taxation.
These are the issues on which final agreement now needs to be reached.
Through months of bilateral contact and negotiation among ministers, we have succeeded in whittling down the outstanding issues to a point where a fair and balanced overall package is achievable.
As in any negotiation, the key ingredients are timing and political will.
People simply weren't ready last December when a first attempt was made to finalize agreement.
The European Council's decision in March to finish the negotiations during the Irish presidency sent a powerful signal of our determination to break the stalemate.
In the last month, I have met all of my colleagues face to face, in their capitals.
We speak often.
I detect no slackening of resolve.
In fact, there is a sense that we cannot afford to fail.
In a challenging period for the Union, it needs to show that, when the chips are down, its members can make collective but difficult decisions in the common interest.
The basic institutional balances between the Commission, the Council and the European Parliament are not in question.
But the EU's institutions need to be modernized.
Greater continuity and focus will be provided through the creation of a full-time chairman of the European Council and an EU Foreign Minister, and there is to be a three-country team presidency of other Council formations.
There is also now an acceptance that the voting system within the European Council should be based on a double majority of population and member states.
This is logical, transparent, and representative.
But the precise arrangements for double majority voting need to be calibrated in a way that respects the particular concerns of all member states, while still ensuring that the new system is more efficient than its predecessor.
I believe that we can settle this most difficult question in an equitable way.
The task of the Commission is to drive forward the EU's agenda in the common interest.
There is a developing consensus that 'representativeness' and legitimacy can be achieved by including nationals of all member states in the next two Commissions, with a move thereafter to a fixed smaller number based on strictly equal rotation.
There is also a need to ensure that the citizens of all member states, big and small, are adequately and appropriately represented in the European Parliament.
The constitution envisages further expanding the parliament's important functions, both legislative and budgetary, in partnership with the member states.
In fact, for the first time, a significant watchdog role is being assigned to national parliaments.
These arrangements will preserve the EU's unique institutional essence - the balances between its institutions and among member states - while offering the prospect of greater effectiveness, efficiency, and transparency.
The constitution will see a further major advance in the use of majority voting, which is necessary in an EU of 25 (and soon more) members.
But a few topics will have to remain subject to unanimous decision, given their special nature.
I believe we are close to a balanced agreement on this.
Too often, the complex issues involved in this kind of negotiation are presented as a battle between one country and another, or between competing ideologies.
From my own long experience of negotiation, I know that talk of winners and losers is not just unhelpful, but misleading.
Everyone must compromise, but they must also see their own hopes and concerns reflected in a final text.
If we succeed this week, it will be a triumph for the EU.
Europe is a confluence of different traditions and histories, of independent sovereign states.
But we are united in our belief that sharing sovereignty and working together is the best - indeed, the only - way forward.
Adopting a constitution means consolidating the end of the bitter divisions of the past, and a chance to build a Union that works for our 450 million people.
No War, No Famine
STOCKHOLM: Two hundred years ago in his essay "Perpetual Peace" Immanuel Kant imagined a future "union of liberal republics."
In 1795, however, liberal republics were abstract ideas. Yet Kant imagined our present reality of flourishing liberal democracies.
Moreover, Kant's idea of perpetual peace seems even less far-fetched because no democracy has ever made war on another.
Indeed, "No War Between Democracies" is as close as we are likely to get to an immutable diplomatic law.
Scholars have demonstrated the truth of this.
Professor R J Rummel of the University of Hawaii investigated 353 pairs of combatants between 1816 and 1991.
Democracy fought non-democracy in 155 cases.
Dictatorship fought dictatorship in 198 cases.
He found no examples of democracies at war with each other.
Some pedants quibble, claiming that exceptions exist.
Study the details, however, and you find that the conflict in question was either some type of civil war or in which one participant was not a real democracy (Germany in 1914), or that the number of people killed was too low to call the conflict a war at all.
This is no mere statistical error or lucky coincidence.
In a democracy it would be almost impossible to secure sufficient public support for a military confrontation with another democracy.
Democratic peoples know and trust each other.
Democratic governments find it natural to negotiate with one another.
The costs humanity has paid in waiting for Kant's vision to near reality is horrific and was exacted in places other than the battlefield.
Between 1900 and 1987 about 170 million people were killed for political reasons not involving war.
Totalitarian states murdered 138 million out of those 170 million. Authoritarian countries killed another 28 million.
Democracies killed about 2 million people, primarily through intentional bombing of civilian targets.
No matter how controversial examples of democratic excess are, however, they do not change the overall picture.
Most of this slaughter was triggered by Marxism/Leninism's fusion of absolutist ideology with absolute power.
To paraphrase Lord Acton's dictum: power kills and absolute power kills absolutely.
Many people reached other conclusions.
When Marxists were strong and liberalism weak, writers, politicians, political parties, and newspapers often told us: democracy is unimportant for the Third World.
Freedom in such countries is a "formality."
Far more urgent is not going hungry.
So, we were lectured: liberalism is no solution for developing countries.
"Don't measure others by our yardsticks," a leading Swedish playright/novelist wrote as Pol Pot's regime exterminated a quarter of Cambodia's population. What he meant was that the mass murder of Cambodians was not deplorable in the same way as the mass murder of Europeans is.
This is inverted racism: you pretend to respect other peoples when, in fact, you despise them.
Indeed, those in the West who praised Mao, Castro or Honecker seldom wanted to import their terror.
Try introducing the slightest limitation on free speech in any Western country and you will meet storms of protest from those who seldom champion it in Third World nations.
Oppression is only acceptable for others.
Hypocrisy, of course, is not confined to the West.
When leaders in, say, Singapore, Malaysia and mainland China talk about "Asian values" to romanticize their regimes, they, too, challenge the values of democracy.
But Taiwan's former President Lee Teng-hui thinks these arguments thin alibis for anti-democratic policies.
When it comes to human rights, says Mr. Lee, there are no special Asian values.
Freedom is a universal value.
Despite communism's collapse, assaults on liberalism remain.
Amartya Sen, a Nobel Laureate in economics, demonstrated empirically that no famine - mass starvation leading to mass death - ever occurred in a democratically governed country.
During the Bengal famine of 1943, two to three million people died from hunger.
That happened under British rule.
Since India became independent in 1947 with a multiparty democratic system, the country has never suffered such a disaster.
Undernourishment, malnutrition, crop failures, and food scarcities have occurred, but there have been no famines.
Compare that with Mao's "Great Leap Forward" of 1958-1961 when 30 million Chinese died of hunger.
That's ten times the number of Indians who died in the gigantic starvation of British India less than twenty years before.
Sen also examined various African countries that experienced crop failures and food shortages.
Governments under democratic pressures usually act forcefully and decently on such occasions; people under dictatorial regimes are often hit by government-induced and manipulated famines.
Where political opposition and a free press are active, governments cannot neglect thousands of people starving to death.
When opposition is silenced and mass media voices only the dictator's propaganda, millions of people dying from famine can be kept secret and/or ignored.
Elie Wiesel, survivor of Auschwitz and Buchenwald and a Nobel Peace Laureate, once said: "Let us remember the heroes of Warsaw, the martyrs of Treblinka, the children of Auschwitz.
They fought alone, they suffered alone, they lived alone, but they did not die alone, for something in all of us died with them". What died with them?
My answer is this: the idea that there are limits to human cruelty.
Now we recognize that there are no limits.
Knowing empirically the benefits in terms of peace and human welfare which democracy delivers, we must reaffirm our commitment to, and the necessity of, spreading Kant's vision.
Palme's Legacy 15 Years On
STOCKHOLM: Olof Palme, Sweden's then Prime Minister, was assassinated 15 years ago on February 28th.
His death shocked millions everywhere.
The murderer has still not been found, at least he has not been convicted.
The crime was an attack not only on Palme, but on democracy itself.
Murdered, Palme is now part of history.
But history is something that must be freely analysed, not silenced out of deference.
So, as we recall Palme's assassination we should also remember how he behaved and what he represented.
What, for example, is Olof Palme's legacy in foreign policy?
Palme was a powerful, eloquent critic of the US and the war in Vietnam.
He cursed Soviet oppression in Czechoslovakia and General Pinochet's murders in Chile.
Because of these stands, Palme has often been portrayed as a consistent adversary of tyrannies.
But this is not quite true. In fact, Palme systematically refrained from criticizing many oppressive regimes and, indeed, embraced some of the cruelest dictators, or at least tried not to offend them.
Do not "vilify" the Soviet Union, said Palme, Chairman of Sweden's Social Democratic Party for 17 years and Prime Minister from 1969-1976 and, again, from 1982-86.
Do not engage in "anti-Soviet agitation" or "the business of anti-Sovietism," he declared in 1984, a typical neutralist stand in Palme's Sweden.
No doubt, Palme reflected the spirit of his times.
The West's Marxist revival after 1968 deeply impressed journalists and socialists, not least in Sweden.
The Vietnam War changed the world view of many young people.
Palme, however, carried this spirit forward so long after many others had seen the liberal light. "Neither communism nor capitalism represents a dream of liberty for the peoples of Europe," he said only a few years before the peoples of East and Central Europe freed themselves from Communism to embrace democracy and capitalism.
Palme also exploited ideological differences over diplomacy to wound other democratic parties in Sweden.
The conservatives were lapsing into "the crusading spirit, aimed at the liberation of Eastern Europe, which prevailed in conservative quarters in the West during the Cold War," he said in 1983--a moment of heightened tension between the West and the USSR.
Eventually, Sweden's Liberals and Conservatives, after 44 years of Socialist rule, came to power in 1976.
None of the threats to Sweden's foreign policy, which Palme confidently predicted, materialized in their nine years in office during the last quarter century.
Divisive at home, Palme tried hard to divide the West at a critical moment.
In the 1980s Social Democrats in Sweden and Germany developed a close ideological collaboration in foreign affairs.
The so-called "Palme Commission" (including the influential Egon Bahr) suggested a policy of "common security" between East and West, and nuclear weapon-free zones instead of NATO's policy of deploying cruise and Pershing II missiles to counter the Soviet advantage in theater nuclear weapons.
This alliance between the two parties led to serious distortions of fundamental Western values.
Palme and Oskar Lafontaine, then one of the leaders of the opposition in Germany, did not see the Cold War as primarily a conflict between freedom and tyranny.
When Palme visited East Germany in 1984 he never criticized repression there, nor the Berlin Wall.
Instead, Palme praised East Germany's leader, Erich Honecker, underlining shared goals and the mutual struggle for peace and development.
Palme's main speech mentioned "détente," "trust,"and "friendship," but never "freedom".
Much the same happened when Palme visited Cuba.
He shared a podium with Fidel Castro at a mass rally in Santiago de Cuba.
Palme spoke appreciatively of "socialist revolution," never mentioning his own party's conviction that "revolution" should take place only after free and honest elections.
Indeed, Palme used Marxist slogans, but said nothing about human rights and political freedom, giving the impression that Sweden and Cuba embraced similar ideologies.
In a joint statement with Castro, Palme claimed that the two men were united in all the areas they had discussed.
They even confirmed their happiness that the struggles for freedom of "the Vietnamese and Cambodian peoples have been crowned with victory."
This was said in the summer of 1975, two months after Cambodia's Khmer Rouge embarked on a genocide that killed two million of the country's seven million people.
Was Olof Palme unaware of Pol Pot's massacres?
Newspapers in almost all democracies, including Sweden, were informing us of the Cambodian horrors.
Palme, however, thought it more important to present a united front with Cuba's tyrant than to worry about atrocities committed by Communists in Indochina.
Palme, indeed, seldom condemned oppression in Third World countries.
He constantly condemned apartheid in South Africa, yet he never criticized Mao's China, the most murderous regime to arise after World War II.
This double standard was particularly pernicious in the Middle East, where Palme never censured an Arab country, regardless of its corruption or cruelty.
The only nation in that region he repeatedly attacked was its only democracy, Israel.
He even equated the Israelis with the Nazis.
Fifteen years after his murder, Sweden and the West must grapple with what Palme left behind, his anti-Western agitation and his willingness to see fundamental ideals of freedom as merely relative values.
For people seeking or defending democracy and human rights, Palme was an unreliable partner.
It is that aspect of his moral "example" that should be recalled.
The Old in the New Anti-Semitism
Why do so many Holocaust survivors sense emerging anti-Jewish threats before seeing them?
Because they know how supposedly "innocent" insinuations grow into accusations and that accusations can become discrimination and soon after legislation.
It is then that hysteria is set loose.
Survivors sound the alarm because they know what is at stake.
By doing so they strengthen our democracies in ways that no other people can.
We listen to the survivors so that we survive.
That we have cause to listen is clear, as the results of the first round of the French presidential elections demonstrate.
But not only demagogues like Jean-Marie Le-Pen and Europe's other lumpen extreme rightists incite trouble.
Throughout the 20

Take the case of the French Ambassador to Britain.
At a dinner party in London not long ago he described Israel as "that shitty little country." His vulgar comments are not particularly frightful.
What is worrying is the response. He was not recalled by his government; Tony Blair's government did not request his recall; popular opinion treated the matter as merely another scandal.
Indeed, the French press thought the ambassador a victim of Britain's tabloid press, not of his contemptible sentiments.
Sadly, the French ambassador to the Court of St. James has many allies among Europe's elites.
But Ambassador Bernard did provide a service; he helped us to recognize how widespread this new anti-Jewishness is.
As one columnist notably said, Israel has become "the object of hate that dare not speak its name."
But we must not only dare, we are obliged to speak.
We must not be silent about the daily attacks in France against Jews and synagogues.
It is a shame for all of Europe that many French Jews cannot send their children to school without worrying about their security.
Anti-Semitic outrages are also reported elsewhere: in Berlin and London, in Switzerland, Italy, Sweden, the Netherlands, and in parts of Eastern Europe.
We must not be silent about the fact that denial of the Holocaust is becoming routine; so too the parallels that anti-Semites/anti-Zionists draw between Israel and the Third Reich.
We must "confront the new Nazi plague which is nesting in Israel," wrote a Syrian paper as Palestinian TV portrays Israeli soldiers as rapists and cold-blooded murderers.
The Mufti of Jerusalem stated that "it's not my fault that Hitler hated the Jews, they hate them just about everywhere."
One Friday sermon on Palestinian TV told Muslims "to have no mercy on the Jews, no matter where you are...kill them... and those Americans who are like them."
What we must remember about anti-Semitism is that, although it always starts with Jews, it never stops with Jews.
Jew-hatred, if not contained, almost always develops into assaults on other groups and minorities and finally undermines democratic institutions and the rule of law.
So the struggle against anti-Semitism is a task for Jews and non-Jews alike.
But it is now a more diffuse struggle than ever because an astonishing element in today's anti-Semitism is its flexibility.
Although anti-Semitism never changes its goal - to attack Jews - it does change its face, its strategy, its rationalizations, even its vocabulary.
Once Jewish religion was the target.
When Judaism did not surrender, Jews were expelled or killed.
In the 19
I do not equate criticism of Israel with anti-Semitism.
It is as legitimate to oppose certain Israeli policies and decisions as it is to scrutinize any nation.
But anti-Zionism is becoming akin to anti-Semitism.
Sometimes anti-Zionists claim that they are not against Jews but are "only" against the Jewish state.
But suppose someone said: "I am only against the existence of Great Britain, I am not anti-British!"
Or if somebody told me that "I love Swedes, but Sweden should be abolished."
You would not believe them.
It is hard to love or respect a people and hate their state.
Yet people pretend that they can where Israel is concerned.
In several UN agencies, Israel-bashing is routine.
This demonization of the only democracy in the Middle East is a central part of the new anti-Jewishness.
When Israel is described "as the enemy of all good and the repository of all that is evil," says Professor Irwin Cotler, a member of Canada's parliament, it becomes a "teaching of contempt" within the UN.
This constant singling out of one nation as humanity's enemy is in fact a campaign directed against the Jewish people.
Indeed, many anti-Jewish outbursts in a number of countries are rooted in condemnations of Israel that exploit anti-Semitic terminology.
Attacks on synagogues are often triggered by a defaming language about the Middle East.
Compared to previous anti-Jewish outbreaks, today's anti-Semitism is less an attack on individual Jews than an attack on the "collective Jew," the state of Israel.
Such attacks, however, have started a chain reaction of assaults across Europe and Latin America on individual Jews and Jewish institutions.
In the past the most dangerous anti-Semites were those who sought to make the world Judenrein , free of Jews.
Today the most dangerous anti-Semites are those who want to make the world Judenstaatrein , free of a Jewish state.
Can A Wimp Disarm Saddam?
The UN's weapons inspectorate chief and Iraq have agreed on tentative terms for the conduct of weapons inspections, which in theory could begin as early as two weeks from now.
But the success of any such deal depends as much on the men who will carry out the inspections as on the details of when, where, and how they are carried out.
Hans Blix will head the UN arms inspectorate charged with searching for, finding, and destroying Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction.
I have known Blix for over forty years.
In 1960 he was my deputy when I was a leader of the Swedish Liberal Youth organization.
Since then I have followed his career closely.
He became Sweden's foreign minister for a year and was later a director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in Vienna.
Personally, Blix is amiable and has a sense of humor; politically he is weak and easily fooled.
I can think of few European officials less suitable for a showdown with Saddam Hussein.
Indeed, it is with utter disbelief that I watch television news about Blix's negotiations with the Iraqi dictator's henchmen.
The world has been amply warned about Blix's weaknesses because he has a track record of compounded failure.
When Blix headed the IAEA before the Gulf War of 1991, he blithely assured the world, after several inspections, that nothing alarming was happening in Iraq.
He delivered the clean bill of health that Saddam had hoped for when he began hiding his atomic factories and ambitions.
Since then, we have learnt all too unambiguously that Saddam is obsessed with procuring weapons of mass destruction - chemical and biological warheads as well as atomic bombs and the missiles to deliver them.
Former experts of Iraq's nuclear weapons program, who have fled Baghdad for the West, confirmed this.
They told us about determined and costly efforts to obtain doomsday devices.
Indeed, it is now clear that Saddam was but a year away from securing his first atomic bomb when the Gulf War broke out.
After that war, UN inspectors found and destroyed huge amounts of chemical and biological warheads as well as facilities to produce nuclear weapons.
Despite his grave failings as IAEA chief before 1991, Blix once again came to lead UN disarmament inspectors, this time in tandem with another Swede, Ambassador Rolf Ekéus.
Blix, naive and relatively ignorant about technical details -- his field is international law -- is easily mislead.
Even after the Gulf war, he failed to realize that the Iraqi officials, who were again assuring the UN that they were hiding nothing, were but consummate liars.
Indeed, Blix believed that Iraq had no program at all for nuclear arms.
David Kay, perhaps the most effective arms inspector, insisted that he did not trust them.
But Blix reproached Kay for his attitude.
You must believe in official information, Blix implied.
The turning point came when Kay initiated inspections of suspect buildings without notifying the Iraqis about his intentions in advance.
This new, aggressive inspection strategy had dramatic consequences: Kay discovered material which confirmed that Iraq was only 12 to 18 months away from producing a nuclear device.
This historic discovery ended up in a confrontation at a parking lot in Baghdad.
UN cars were surrounded by 200 Iraqi soldiers and a mob, ordered out to the scene by Iraqi officials.
For four days and nights the siege continued, as Kay and his colleagues used satellite telephones to fax crucial documents to the West.
Blix had opposed the raid.
Fortunately, Ambassador Ekéus backed it and supported the inspectors during the siege.
I have met a number of experts on Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, and they often compare the two Swedes: "Ekéus is brilliant," they say, "Blix is terrible."
When the current UN inspectorate was being put together in 1999, both Ekéus and Blix were among the candidates being considered to head the new group of inspectors.
Friends of Iraq in Paris and Moscow consulted Baghdad to see whom Saddam would prefer.
France and Russia then suggested Blix.
Surprisingly the Clinton administration accepted that decision.
Saddam's chemical and biological arms, and his determination to get nuclear weapons, are a threat to the world.
The dictator could use these arms himself or make them available to terrorist organizations.
And the issue of war and peace depends on a man repeatedly duped by the Iraqi regime.
The Bush administration probably understands Blix's weaknesses.
My guess is that the US will not allow Blix and the inspectors that he oversees to be deceived by Iraq again.
Regardless of how this crisis develops from this point, the UN has neglected its duties by asking a wimp to lead the inspectors who are supposed to stand up to the brute of Baghdad.
The UN Heresy
No other organization is held in such respect as the United Nations.
This is perhaps natural, for the UN embodies some of humanity's noblest dreams.
But, as the current scandal surrounding the UN's administration of the Iraq oil for food program demonstrates, and as the world remembers the Rwanda genocide that began ten years ago, respect for the UN should be viewed as something of a superstition, with Secretary General Kofi Annan its false prophet.
Not since Dag Hammarskjöld has a UN leader been as acclaimed as Annan.
Up to a point, this is understandable.
Annan usually maintains an unruffled, dignified demeanor.
He has charm and - many say - charisma.
But a leader ought to be judged by his or her actions when important matters are at stake.
Annan's failures in such situations are almost invariably glossed over.
Between 1993 and 1996, Annan was Assistant Secretary-General for UN Peacekeeping Operations and then Under-Secretary-General.
One of the two great disasters for which he bears a large share of the blame is the Serbian slaughter of 7,000 people in the Bosnian town of Srebrenica, perhaps the worst massacre in postwar Europe.
In 1993, Bosnia's Muslems were promised that UN forces would protect them.
This commitment was a precondition of their consenting to disarm.
The UN declared Srebrenica a "safe haven" to be "protected" by 600 Dutch UN troops.
In July 1995, Serb forces attacked.
The UN did not honor its pledge.
Annan's staff released evasive, confused statements.
Oblivious, apparently, to the dreadfulness of the situation, they failed to sound the alarm properly and did nothing to intervene.
The Dutch fired not a single shot.
NATO air power could have halted the Serbs, but Annan did not ask for NATO intervention.
Ratko Mladic, the Serb commander and war criminal, deported the women and children under the eyes of the UN, while capturing and murdering the men and adolescent boys.
No one should be surprised by the UN's inaction, because only the year before it had demonstrated utter incompetence in facing the fastest genocide in history - the slaughter of 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus in Rwanda in just 100 days.
UN forces in Rwanda in 1994 were Annan's responsibility before and during the crisis.
Annan was alerted four months before Hutu activists began their mass killings by a fax message from Romeo Dallaire, the Canadian general commanding UN forces in Rwanda.
Dallaire described in detail how the Hutus were planning "anti-Tutsi extermination."
He identified his source "a Hutu" and reported that arms were ready for the impending ethnic cleansing.
Dallaire requested permission to evacuate his informant and to seize the arms cache.
Annan rejected both demands, proposing that Dallaire make the informant's identity known to Rwandan President Habyarimana, a Hutu, even though the informant had expressly named the President's closest entourage as the authors of the genocide blueprint.
Annan maintained his extreme passiveness even after the airplane crash that killed Habyarimana, which signaled the genocide's start, helped by the indifference of the great powers (America not least).
One might think Annan far too compromised for the post of Secretary-General, but the UN doesn't work that way.
Instead of being forced to resign after Rwanda and Srebrenica, he was promoted to Secretary-General.
That is the culture of the UN: believe the best of barbarians, do nothing to provoke controversy among superiors, and let others be the butt of criticism afterwards.
Even subsequent revelations about Annan's responsibility for the disasters in Rwanda and Bosnia did not affect his standing.
On the contrary, he was unanimously re-elected and awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
He is the all-time Teflon diplomat.
The media sometimes ratchets up admiration for Annan by pointing out that his wife is Swedish and a close relative of Raoul Wallenberg.
We are meant to infer that, on top of all his talents, Annan shares the ideals embodied during the last days of WWII by the foremost Swede of modern times.
But Wallenberg's name should make us even more dismayed about Annan's record.
Wallenberg refused to ignore the threat of massacres to come.
Instead of ducking responsibility and carrying on with conventional work in Sweden, he made his way to Hungary, the scene of Hitler's last homicidal orgy against the Jews.
In Budapest, Wallenberg exploited every available contact, resorting to shady tricks, bribes, and other stratagems to save as many people as possible from the Holocaust.
He never allowed himself to be duped by Hitler's cronies.
Perhaps no one's achievement should be judged by comparison with that of Wallenberg - a titan of strength, courage, and perseverance.
The trouble with Annan is that, when similar perils loomed, he proved especially wanting.
Annan cannot plead that he faced any risk to his personal safety, whereas Wallenberg in 1944 and 1945 was in constant peril.
Nor can he possibly excuse himself by saying that no warnings were given, or that he lacked resources, or that he did not have the international position to intervene.
Annan had at his disposal all of the instruments of power and opinion that Wallenberg lacked.
Yet when thousands or hundreds of thousands of people were exposed to mortal threats that he had the authority and duty to avert, alleviate, or at least announce, he failed abjectly.
Now, despite the recent revelations about briberies in the UN's oil-for-food program for Iraq, the world is clamoring to entrust Annan with the future of more than 20 million Iraqis who survived Saddam Hussein's depraved dictatorship.
That is both because of who Annan is and what the UN has become: an institution in which no shortcoming, it seems, goes unrewarded.
The Swedenization of Europe
Anti-Semitism, anti-Zionism, and anti-Americanism are becoming linked and ever more rabid in today's Europe.
They arise from a kind of blindness, combined with a strange mixture of alienation, guilt, and fear toward both Israel and America.
Millions of Europeans resist seeing Israel as a country fighting for its survival.
Israel cannot afford to lose one major war, as it would mean the end of the Jewish democratic state.
But huge numbers of Europeans believe that something is fundamentally wrong with the Israelis: they never compromise; they prefer using military means to solve political problems.
Something similar is at work in the European attitude to the US.
Look at Europe, many Europeans say, we have eradicated wars, dangerous nationalism, and dictatorships.
We created a peaceful European Union.
We do not wage war; we negotiate.
We do not exhaust our resources on weapons.
The rest of the planet should learn from us how to live together without terrorizing each other.
As a Swede, I have heard such pacific boasting all my life: that neutral Sweden is a moral superpower.
Now this bragging has become the EU's ideology.
We are the moral continent.
Call this the "Swedenization" of Europe.
Yes, today's EU is a miracle for a continent where two modern totalitarian movements - Communism and Nazism - unleashed rivers of blood.
But what Europe forgets is how those ideologies were overcome.
Without the US Army, Western Europe would not have been liberated in 1945.
Without the Marshall Plan and NATO, it would not have taken off economically.
Without the policy of containment under America's security umbrella, the Red Army would have strangled the dream of freedom in Eastern Europe, or brought European unity, but under a flag with red stars.
West Europeans also forget that some areas of the world have never known freedom.
In many places, torture chambers are the rules of the game, not the grotesque and shameful mistakes of ill-supervised troops.
Any attempt in such places to go behave the European way and negotiate - without the military power needed to back up diplomacy - would be pathetic.
Instead of supporting those who fight international terrorism, many Europeans try to blame the spread of terrorism on Israel and the US.
This is a new European illusion.
Spain's latter day appeasement à la Munich arises from this thinking.
But what if Spain - and Europe as a whole - had reacted in the opposite way to the Madrid train bombing of April, saying: "We promise that because of that slaughter we will double our support for stabilization in Iraq by sending twice as many troops, experts, engineers, teachers, policemen, doctors, and billions of euros in support of allied forces and their Iraqi co-workers."
The triumph of terrorists would have been transformed into a triumph of the war on terror.
The images many Europeans hold of America and Israel create the political climate for some very ugly bias.
You have the Great Satan and the Small Satan.
America wants to dominate the world - exactly the allegations made in traditional anti-Semitic rhetoric about the Jews.
Indeed, modern anti-Zionist rhetoric portrays Israel's goal as domination of the whole Middle East.
Such ideas are reflected in opinions polls in which Europeans claim that Israel and the US are the true dangers to world peace.
Ian Buruma, the British writer, claims that this European rage against America and Israel has to do with guilt and fear.
The two world wars led to such catastrophic carnage that "never again" was interpreted as "welfare at home, non-intervention abroad."
The problem with this concept is that it could only survive under the protection of American might.
Extreme anti-Americanism and anti-Zionism are actually merging.
The so-called peace poster "Hitler Had Two Sons: Bush and Sharon," displayed in European anti-war rallies, combines trivialization of Nazism with demonization of both the victims of Nazism and those who defeated Nazism.
Much of this grows from a subconscious European guilt related to the Holocaust.
Now the Holocaust's victims - and their children and grandchildren - are supposedly doing to others what was done to them.
By equating the murderer and the victim, we wash our hands.
This pattern of anti-Zionism and anti-Americanism returns again and again.
"The ugly Israeli" and "the ugly American" seem to be of the same family.
"The ugly Jew" becomes the instrumental part of this defamation when so-called neoconservatives are blamed both for American militarism and Israeli brutalities and then selectively named: Wolfowitz, Perle, Abrams, Kristol, etc.
This is a new version of the old myth that Jews rule the US.
Earlier this year, the editor of Die Zeit , Josef Joffe, put his finger on the issue: like Jews, Americans are said to be selfish and arrogant.
Like Jews, they are in thrall to a fundamentalist religion that renders them self-righteous and dangerous.
Like Jews, Americans are money-grabbing capitalists, for whom the highest value is the cash nexus. "America and Israel are the outsiders - just as Jews have been all the way into the 21st century," Joffe says.
The links between anti-Semitism, anti-Zionism, and anti-Americanism are all too real.
Unless Europe's leaders roundly condemn this unholy triple alliance, it will poison Middle East politics and transatlantic relations alike.
Europe and Asia's Arms Race
When European unification was launched, it was thought that "ever closer union" would establish a community that would protect Europeans from political blackmail.
Now we see -- though the lifting of the Union's arms embargo may now be delayed thanks to US pressure and Chinese aggressiveness -- that the European Union has become merely a tool for corruption when France and China draw up joint action plans.
The strategy is simple and ruthless.
The world's largest dictatorship is preparing to crush and occupy the first Chinese democracy in history -- Taiwan.
In order to do so, the People's Republic needs much more sophisticated arms than those it possesses today.
The United States naturally does not export such arms to China.
Instead, the US is trying to deter China's rulers from launching a military attack on the democrats in Taiwan.
But if the EU ever begins to offer China extensive exports of powerful and offensive weapons systems, the military power of the People's Liberation Army would be able to defeat Taiwan's defense forces.
Over 600 missiles, already deployed on the mainland, are aimed at cities and military bases on the island.
The threat is more apparent than real -- for now.
Russia currently sells certain arms to China, but avoids exporting its most sophisticated systems, since the Kremlin views China as a potential future threat.
However, if EU countries start competing for a share of the Chinese market, the Russians could soon be tempted to sell their best arms to the communist regime in Beijing.
China's new armaments, together with the North Korean crisis, will probably force half a dozen countries in the region to renew their armed forces.
Thus, by whenever the Union should decide to lift its ban on weapons exports to China, the EU could help fuel an arms race in East Asia.
How did China and France manage to fool the EU into thinking that it should ever take part in this?
When Jacques Chirac's government decided to expound its economic co-operation with China, arms became an important component in the strategy.
Just as a ruthless Prime Minister Chirac sold a nuclear reactor to Saddam Hussein in the 1970's, so the President Chirac of today is being lured into doing big business with another aggressive dictatorship.
The rest is a question of economic blackmail.
French diplomats have of course informed China about the reluctance of other European countries about lifting the arms embargo, which was imposed after the massacre in Tiananmen Square in 1989.
China then simply threatened to abandon or never to conclude trade deals with these EU members.
To the Germans, the Chinese probably murmur something about Siemens and Volkswagen.
To the Dutch their whispers are most likely about Philips.
China follows the power game within the EU through its French friends, and therefore knows which governments need to be whipped into line.
In Sweden, it has probably been enough to whisper "Ericsson" and "Volvo" to make Primer Minister Göran Persson understand what is at stake for his country commercially.
What European nation, indeed, dares to put at risk a Chinese order for several billion euros?
Typically enough, no EU-country has mentioned Taiwan as a reason not to resume arms exports.
Instead, the EU talks of a "code of conduct" (which probably does not mean very much, but sounds nice) and "free trade" (another charming euphemism for arms exports to dictatorships.
This silence gives a hideous signal.
For what the EU in practice says to China is this: "Taiwan's cause in not our own." If and when the Union lifts the embargo, Europe will be refusing to take responsibility for the catastrophe that may be approaching.
As usual, it is up to America to protect a free nation that may otherwise be destroyed.
Compare this situation to the drama 60 years ago.
Then it was American troops and arms that liberated Western Europe from Nazism.
Now it may be European arms in the hands of the Chinese that will be aimed at American troops protecting a democracy with 23 million inhabitants (in other words, as many people as in all the Nordic countries combined).
As Tom Lantos, a Democratic US Congressman from California, put it, the move to lift the ban on arms exports to China clearly shows that the EU has "lost its moral compass."
Lantos knows about moral compasses: as a boy, he was rescued by Raoul Wallenberg from being deported to Auschwitz by the Nazis in Budapest.
Wallenberg was a Swede.
But now Sweden is revealing that it, too, lacks political morality.
Several friends of mine in the Conservative party's parliamentary group have long been engaged in supporting a free Taiwan.
Over the past ten years, we have held Scandinavian conferences on Taiwan in the parliaments in Copenhagen, Oslo, and Stockholm.
But a call from Prime Minister Persson was enough to render the Conservative party leader Fredrik Reinfeldt docile.
Persson had discovered that he lacked a majority in the Swedish parliament to lift the arms embargo on China.
By whispering "Ericsson" into Reinfeldt's ear, it seems, Persson achieved the desired result.
Reinfeldt became the first Conservative party leader in Swedish history to encourage arms exports to a Communist dictatorship.
But Reinfeldt, like Jacques Chirac, has forgotten something.
Liberal-minded people may very well prefer not just to exchange one cynical prime minister for another at the next election.
They may prefer a clear choice.
Make the UN Stand for Freedom
For Sweden, my homeland, the United Nations is a sacred cow.
But today, many Swedes, like others around the world, are having second thoughts.
Three events incited these doubts.
The first was the slaughter in Rwanda a decade ago of more than 800,000 people within 100 days -- probably the fastest genocide ever.
The well-documented fact is that Kofi Annan, then the UN's Deputy Secretary General, ordered UN soldiers in Rwanda not to intervene or protect the victims.
That Annan, after this enormous failure, was promoted to Secretary General of the UN remains a puzzle.
Doubts about the UN, and Annan personally, were compounded by the ongoing scandal within the UN administration concerning the Oil for Food program.
Although reports have so far not implicated Annan directly, his management failures are abundantly clear.
The third -- and perhaps the most disillusioning -- scandal concerns the Commission on Human Rights, for it lays bare much about the structural and permanent lack of balance and morality within key UN agencies.
Most people assume that this Commission exists to promote human rights and democratic freedoms.
Yet some of the worst human rights violators are Commission members.
These enemies of freedom are permanently silent about torture, oppression, and mass murder carried out by their fellow dictatorships, but are quick to rant against the world's democracies, in particular the United States.
After more than a third of a century at the UN, even Annan has come close to admitting that the Commission on Human Rights is a source of shame.
Is it reasonable to elect a pyromaniac to the board of a fire department?
Of course not.
So why is it that tyrannies like Cuba, China, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, and Zimbabwe are members of this Commission?
Recent members also include Libya, Vietnam, Congo, and Syria -- the Libyans were even elected chair-country.
How can this be?
About half of today's UN members are democracies, the other half non-democracies.
So totalitarian or authoritarian states -- more interested in hiding their own oppression than fairly judging other nations -- can easily trigger a sort of political pogrom against any democracy that annoys enough tyrants.
Sadly, many free countries seem utterly indifferent to the ongoing campaign against Israel.
To prevent such vicious absurdities from continuing, the world's democracies must unite to prevent any country that systematically violates human rights from being allowed to be a member of the Commission on Human Rights.
Ongoing democratization in regions that have known only dictatorship provides hope that the balance is tilting in a way that would enable it possible for at least one UN body should incarnate freedom.
Who should decide if a country is democratic or not?
A tremendously respected independent think tank, Freedom House, is, like the UN's headquarters, located in New York City.
Freedom House is led and advised by experts on 190 countries.
Freedom House monitors developments over time and makes its conclusions public in its "Annual Survey of Political Rights and Civil Liberties."
If there is one book that should be compulsory reading for anyone who makes public statements about human rights, this is it.
So the goal of all free countries should be that only other free countries are allowed seats on the Commission for Human Rights.
Regimes that are "partly free" or "not free" should never be elected or appointed, for the only governments with the moral legitimacy to review and criticize human rights records are those that came to power through free elections and that can lose power when a new election defeats them.
Those who have attained power through violence and fraud are not legitimate and should never more shame the UN by being members of this Commission.
Unfortunately, most democracies are often unwilling to fight against the perversion of the UN Human Rights Commission.
The European Union represents 25 democracies and often inspires countries to seek their freedom, as it has in Ukraine and Lebanon.
But the EU's habit is not to defeat the UN's extremists, but to make strange compromises with them.
As a result, rogue states make a few concessions to get the Europeans and others on board and then claim moral parity with the democracies.
Free peoples everywhere should remember that totalitarian forces and ideas cannot be defeated by being nice and accommodating.
The Commission on Human Rights must rid itself of members that detest freedom.
Otherwise, the sole UN agency that concentrates on freedom will be nothing more than a handmaiden to tyranny.
But as someone trained in American law who has taught at an American law school, I also am aware of the shortcomings in how Sharia is applied, especially in its treatment of women.
No matter how great the outcry against the death sentences imposed on adulterous women, Sharia law cannot be wished away here.
Islamic law has long been an integral part of social life in Nigeria.
It will remain so.
The challenge facing Sharia's critics is to modernize Islamic law, not banish it from public life.
Sharia law is undoubtedly controversial.
Its severe punishments fly in the face of Western legal canons.
I have mixed feelings about these penalties.
In theory, I accept the death penalty and even amputations, though in practice I believe that implementers of Sharia show little understanding for the reality that much crime stems from poverty and desperation.
In my view, amputation for thieves should not be carried out unless and until society's poor are better provided for.
The process leading to the death penalties imposed by Sharia courts have drawn rebukes from around the world, and for good reason.
Sharia law as applied in Nigeria today is insensitive to the welfare of women.
Why are only women sentenced to death for adultery, while men go free?
Sharia courts contend that unless four witnesses catch a man in the act, he cannot be convicted.
This standard of proof is so difficult to meet that men simply are not convicted.
Until Sharia can handle adultery fairly, no penalties should be imposed.
But attention to sensational cases of amputation and death by stoning, while justified, obscures the reality that the bulk of Sharia cases involve family matters and ordinary commercial law.
Sharia, with its emphasis on swift justice, is often preferable to civil law in a country such as Nigeria, where courts are poorly administered and cases move slowly, when they move at all.
It may surprise non-Muslims, but some Nigerian Christians prefer to file their cases in Sharia courts because of their speed, fairness, and relative unconcern with legal technicalities.
Recently, a Christian car buyer drew wide attention in Nigeria when he was duped by a Muslim car seller and took his case to a Sharia court.
Within a few weeks, he won--and paid no legal fees.
Too often, however, Sharia law harms Christians.
In one Nigerian state, Christian bus operators are discouraged and sometimes prohibited from carrying both men and women in a single trip.
Christian businessmen have also suffered because the ban on the commercial sale of alcohol has led to the destruction of their beverage stocks.
Why is Islamic law growing in importance?
The end of Nigeria's military dictatorship and the return to civilian, elected government created countless beneficial freedoms.
But freedom of expression resulted in more militant religious positions.
The tensions spawned by Islamic law might be justified if it targeted Nigeria's biggest problem: government corruption.
Muslim politicians know that corruption is killing our country and yet Sharia law is not applied to the misdeeds of public officials.
Only when the spotlight of Sharia shines on government wrongdoing will we know that Nigeria is on the road to prosperity.
The shortcomings of Sharia, however serious, need not doom Islamic law in a society where Christians and traditional believers roughly equal Muslims in number.
Sharia can be reformed in ways that make the law more tolerant, open, and acceptable to non-Muslims.
It is not absurd to speak of a cosmopolitan Sharia.
In Islamic tradition, reform of Sharia results from an Ijtijad , a creative and intellectual effort to apply Islamic law to new circumstances.
Sharia first blossomed during a period of creative ferment centuries ago, but stagnated when later generations came to believe that the law need not adapt to changing circumstances.
Backing the Right Horse in Pakistan
Like General Musharraf, most moderate, secular political parties in Pakistan believe that supporting the anti-terrorist campaign is in their country's national interest, because international isolation is the only other option.
Moreover, mainstream parties such as the Pakistan People's Party (PPP) and the National Awami Party (ANP) oppose the Taliban's distorted view of Islam, as well as its support for local Sunni radicals who carried out terrorist attacks within Pakistan.
But General Musharraf, Pakistan's self-appointed president since October 1999, is leaving little to chance.
The war against Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda network and its Taliban protectors has helped him consolidate his hold on power, providing a pretext for extending his term as Chief of Army Staff and reshuffling the military high command to remove or sideline potential rivals.
He also has named a close ally, General Ehsanul Haque, to head the powerful Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) agency and has promoted protégés to other key positions, including vital corps commands and the Vice Chief of Army Staff.
So far, General Musharraf's immediate goal appears to be stability.
If he remains confident of Western acquiescence, however, he may be tempted to backtrack on his pledge to restore democracy by October 2002, the deadline imposed by Pakistan's Supreme Court.
Indeed, he has already regained respectability since the September 11th attacks in the US, which turned Pakistan overnight into a "frontline" state in the campaign against terror.
Previously, the country had been an international pariah owing to the military's seizure of power, General Musharraf's commitment to nuclear weapons tests, and the military's support for the Taliban.
Of course, Pakistan's intimate knowledge of the Taliban is a prime asset for US military planners.
Pakistani intelligence is essential to identifying targets, and Pakistani military personnel will be invaluable in guiding US search and destroy missions across Afghanistan's treacherous terrain.
The military's considerable influence with cross-border Pashtun tribes, the Taliban's main ethnic constituency, may also be helpful, because effective ground strikes will most likely require that Western special forces move into Taliban-controlled territory from Pakistan's Baluchistan and Northwest Frontier provinces.
Cooperation with the West has already won General Musharraf's regime substantial rewards.
The US, Japan, and the European Union are easing diplomatic and economic sanctions, and multilateral financial assistance has resumed.
The danger, however, is that these concessions will provide the military with the political and economic clout it needs to resist internal demands for a return to democracy.
In fact, General Musharraf seems to have convinced the Bush Administration and a broad segment of Western opinion that military rule is a necessary evil.
With Pakistan's support for the US-led offensive against Afghanistan fueling domestic religious extremism, only the military, according to this argument, can prevent the Talibanization of a nuclear-armed regional power.
But this is a specious claim.
After all, it was Pakistan's military that nurtured religious extremism in Afghanistan and in Pakistan itself.
In 1994, the military recruited Afghan students ( talibs ) from Islamic seminaries ( madrasses ) run by Pakistani religious parties.
With Pakistani military and political support, the Taliban ousted Mullah Burhanuddin Rabbani's government in 1996 and eventually captured 90% of Afghanistan.
The Taliban repaid their debt by training and indoctrinating Islamic extremists, some of which have acted as Pakistan's proxies in the anti-Indian insurgency in Kashmir.
Today, the religious parties that helped create and sustain the Taliban, particularly the Jamiat-i-Islami (Society of Islam), are estranged from Pakistan's military and are the most vocal opponents of the regime's pro-US stance.
Their followers are well organized, well armed and well trained.
But they remain a minority (if a noisy one), and with many of their leaders under arrest, pose no significant threat to the military.
For this reason, the US and its allies should heed the warnings of Pakistani moderates, who repeatedly say that long-term political stability requires a return to democratic rule.
US support for three successive military rulers allowed Pakistani religious extremists to establish their public foothold- ironically, by exploiting anti-American sentiments.
That same double game is, perhaps, still being played.
For even as Pakistan's military and security services help the US fight Al Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan, General Musharraf continues to support the same breed of religious extremism in Kashmir.
Should the US back him unconditionally, the only loser will be Pakistan's moderate secular opposition.
General Musharraf deserves praise for his current pro-US stance.
But this should not exempt his regime from international pressure to abide by the Supreme Court's timetable for democratic restoration.
The alternative is to entrust the stability of a conflict-prone region to the Pakistani military, itself a major culprit behind the spread of Islamic extremism.
US foreign policy towards the region must recognize that a moderate, democratic Pakistan implies a far more reliable partnership than an alliance of expediency with an un-elected and unreliable military regime.
Korea Emerges from Crisis
SEOUL: Last year saw the worst of times in South Korea since the end of the Korean War, with Asia's crisis bringing a devastating 33.8% drop in per capita GDP, from $10,307 to $6,823 and mass starvation in North Korea threatening stability on the peninsula.
Times of crisis, however, like the approach of an execution, concentrate the mind.
South Korea has focused on systemic reform and, today, despite labour unrest the signs of economic recovery abound and political prospects are brightening, too.
Even relations with the North may be slightly more predictable.
In the year-and-a-half since South Korea received a $57billion IMF bailout, and the 13 months since former dissident Kim Dae Jung became president, the currency (the won) has stabilized, short-term debts have been rolled over into long-term ones, foreign reserves have increased, and interest rates have been cut.
Foreign reserves stood above $50 billion at the end of 1998, compared to under $9 billion a year before, thanks mostly to a $39 billion trade surplus last year, the first in nine years.
This surplus enabled a stabilizing of the won at 1,200 to the dollar, compared to the 2,000 to 1 ratio of 1997.
Much has been done, but South Korea has only touched the surface in restructuring its economy, its relations with the North, and domestic political reform.
A cabinet shake-up this week points to President Kim's recognition that much more needs to be done.
In all areas the direction is toward even liberalization, but President Kim's path to liberalism is through a curious kind of social corporatism.
These detours are necessary because of the roadblocks posed by big labor and even bigger business.
The most important challenge now is for President Kim to build a new ruling coalition that can ensure a measure of political stability at home as the economy is opened up and the knotty issues of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles in North Korea are tackled.
So-called "Asian values" are not in President Kim's vocabulary.
He believes that democracy and a market economy are not opposites but complement each other.
After consulting the IMF, the government has pushed insolvent banks to merge or face bankruptcy, allowed for the first big layoffs of workers, and "downsized" the bureaucracy through a strict reorganization.
In all this President Kim assumed personal leadership, surprising many with his grasp of, and commitment to, liberal economic ideas.
Korea's five huge conglomerates, the chaebol -- Hyundai, Samsung, Daewoo, LG and SK groups -- have been dragged, kicking and screaming, into rationalization.
They have been pushed into concentrating on core businesses, and encouraged to swap overlapping enterprises.
So Daewoo took over Samsung's car plants, and Samsung took over Daewoo's electronics subsidiaries.
Although they pay lip service to a continued shedding of extraneous businesses, the chaebol still resist complete rationalization, claiming that they cannot rid themselves of excess capacity so long as they maintain excess employment.
They say that "market forces" will, in time, sort out their profit-losing units.
But without even stronger signs from President Kim that another big round of layoffs will be supported by government, it is unlikely that the chaebol will do much more restructuring on their own.
Labor unions have been just as disagreeable as chaebol bosses.
Two million are now unemployed, fully 9% of the workforce and a nightmarish figure already for the government.
To promote industrial peace, President Kim instituted an emergency Tripartite Commission on Labor, Business and Government so that the government could mediate conflicts between labor and business on employment policy. When this took off in January 1998, the labor unions did accept the inevitability of layoffs.
As mass layoffs became reality, the radical Korean Confederation of Trade Unions withdrew from the commission.
This prompted the moderate Federation of Korean Trade Unions to follow it into the wilderness.
Because no social safety net protects workers, the government is finding it next to impossible to keep unions as partners in its corporatist design.
Relations with North Korea remain the central priority, and always the greatest danger.
A bold program to allow cruise boats to call at the holy Mount Kumkang in the North has seen over 40,000 South Koreans visit the famous site for the first time since 1945.
Whether this thaw yields more meaningful fruit hinges on the North maintaining its freeze on nuclear and missile tests.
Former U.S. secretary of defense William Perry is leading a comprehensive review of the joint US/South Korean approach to the North Korea now.
But ambitious domestic and foreign policy reforms demand public and political support.
President Kim must decide this year whether or not to keep the promise he made with Prime Minister Kim Jong Pil to change Korea into a parliamentary system of government.
Because the president's party controls only a third of the seats in the National Assembly, a new ruling coalition will be needed, which is tricky as parties are now increasingly divided along regional lines.
President Kim has needed all the powers of the presidency to push reform along this far.
Whether or not to surrender some of those powers in order to deepen Korean democracy is the riskiest question he now faces.
Building on the Kim/Kim Summit
PYONGYANG: Is the Cold War's last glacier beginning to melt?
The summit between South Korean President Kim Dae Jung and North Korea's "Dear Leader" Kim Jong Il raised hopes on both sides of the Korean peninsula that 55 years of hot and cold war may diminish.
Because Korea remains the world's most heavily armed flash point and with the risk of nuclear weapons and missile proliferation still high in North Korea, the whole world may benefit from a loosening of tensions. For that to happen, however, more than the two Korean governments must act imaginatively and responsibly.
Kim Dae Jung's visit to North Korea provided Kim Jong Il with a historic opportunity to convey the message that North Korea is breaking out of self-imposed isolation.
By shaking hands with and embracing the South Korean president so publicly and so dramatically, Kim Jong Il demonstrated that he was seriously committed to beginning the process of normalizing political and economic relations between the two Koreas.
The warmth of his greeting showed the world that North Korea was indeed opening up; and it showed North Korea's own people that their government was going to change -- how is still unclear -- in order to survive in a rapidly globalizing world.
Kim Jong Il's actions also projected a new image of himself as a serious and reasonable leader, not the sinister recluse frequently depicted in newspapers.
The two Kims agreed in principle to work toward reunification by making joint efforts "independently" of outside influence, and to find common ground between the South's idea of a North-South "commonwealth" or confederation, and the North's idea of Alow-level federation".
They promised to help families separated by the Demilitarized Zone for half-a-century meet and to promote exchanges in various fields including economic cooperation.
Regular government to government meetings will tackle these matters.
Although some of this may sound like the normal hot air of goodwill found at the end of all summits, the very public commitments of the two leaders will provide real impetus to move ahead.
A real test of how far the process can go, and how quickly, will occur when and if Kim Jong Il actually pays a return visit to Seoul, as he agreed to do "at an appropriate time."
Is Kim Jong Il really signaling a fundamental change?
Is he prepared to pull his troops back from the Demilitarized Zone and dismantle the tens of thousands of artillery that are capable of reaching Seoul?
Is he ready to maintain today's freeze on developing nuclear weapons and to assure that North Korea does not export, develop, or deploy ballistic missiles?
So long as the danger of nuclear and missile proliferation in North Korea remains, the peninsula will remain a potential source of conflict.
North and South Korea remain technically at war even now.
Against this background, it is premature to talk about withdrawing American troops.
Although these knotty issues remain, they can now be addressed with more confidence because doubt as to who is really in charge in North Korea was put to rest. Kim Jong Il rules in North Korea.
His fingerprints are everywhere to be seen, not only in the summit's events, but it now appears clear that he was fully behind the policy of engagement initiated by President Clinton and the Japanese government after North Korea test-fired a medium range ballistic missile in August 1998.
By beginning to normalize relations with South Korea, Kim Jong Il gains leverage in his dealings not only with South Korea, but also in negotiations with the US, Japan, China, and Russia.
If this effort is to bear real fruit for him, however, he must continue to transform North Korea's Arogue state" image into that of a normal state.
That the US welcomed the steps taken so far was indicated by the Clinton administration's decision to actually implement its previously announced intention to lift trade sanctions on North Korean exports.
So building on the summit is not only a job for the two Kims.
The first task facing South Korea's government is to bring the US on board for a policy of increasing "Koreanization" of affairs on the peninsula.
Given a rising trend of big power rivalry over Korea in recent years, this may be no straightforward thing.
But it is vitally important to decouple the Korean peace process from Sino-American and Russo-American rivalries, particularly on the emerging hot button issues of national missile defense(NMD) and theatre missile defense(TMD) programs that America is contemplating.
China and Russia, too, have been building their stakes in North Korea.
Beijing hosted a secret visit by Kim Jong Il at the end of May, perhaps to talk him into hosting the summit as a wedge to replace Washington as the major player on the peninsula.
Russian President Vladimir Putin is poised to visit Pyongyang in July in search of support for his objections to America's proposed anti-missile shield.
And just as these two Asian land powers cultivate Kim Jong Il, Washington is seeking talks over missiles with Pyongyang and Tokyo is eager to reestablish diplomatic relations with the North.
America and Japan helped push North Korea to talk with South Korea.
It is incumbent upon South Korea to keep both governments closely informed of its efforts to secure some control over North-South reconciliation.
Because China's role is rising, it is crucial that the US and China restore their strategic dialogue and cooperate by decoupling the North Korean missile issue from the fractious issue of missile defense.
The two Kims have moved the Korean peninsula closer to peace than anyone dared hope one week ago.
Their efforts must be supported and sustained by the other powers with interests in the Koreas.
Sinking the Sunshine Policy
Last week's naval battle between North and South Korean warships sank more than a South Korean frigate.
It also probably sank the "Sunshine Policy" of rapprochement with North Korea that once appeared to be the crowning achievement of Kim Dae Jung's presidency in South Korea.
Two years have passed since Kim Dae Jung and North Korea's Chairman Kim Jong Il met in Pyongyang, the North's impoverished capital.
Since then, Kim Jong Il has failed to make his promised return visit to Seoul.
That failure suggests that North Korea's fundamental hostility to the South remains unabated.
Why?
We can only speculate that North Korea's military is resisting any real change because the regime's survival depends on its "military first" politics.
So long as North Korea's military remains the guardian of the regime by advocating this doctrine, it will be impossible for Kim Jong Il to change his country's ruling domestic and foreign policies.
Many explanations for the North's aggressive behavior are in contention in the South.
Perhaps North Korea wanted to disrupt the World Cup tournament that South Korea was co-hosting with Japan and in which South Korea's national team had achieved stunning success.
More plausible is the idea that the North wanted to deliver a message: it does not want to be ignored by the South, the US, China, or any other concerned party.
Whatever its motivations, one thing is clear: North Korea is not going to help President Kim sustain the "Sunshine Policy" as the primary legacy of his government after he leaves office in February 2003.
North Korea's relations with America are also at a new low water mark.
Just before the naval skirmish broke out, the Bush administration sent Assistant Secretary of State James Kelly to Pyongyang to probe North Korea on missile and nuclear weapon proliferation and conventional forces.
Nothing came of that visit.
So the trend is worrying.
In February, President Bush declared the North a member of the "axis of evil" and in March the Pentagon singled North Korea as a possible target for a preemptive nuclear strike should it invade South Korea.
In April the Bush administration refused to certify that North Korea is abiding by the 1994 agreement to freeze its nuclear weapons program.
Now America is asking that North Korea accept International Atomic Energy Agency inspection on its nuclear sites.
The US wants to find out whether the North is hiding nuclear weapon materials before South Korean workers begin to create the foundations for the two light water nuclear reactors promised in that 1994 agreement.
North Korea must also soon declare whether or not it will continue its declared moratorium on testing ballistic missile in early 2003.
Unlike the Clinton administration, which saw engagement with North Korea as a goal in itself, the Bush administration is focused on preventing North Korean missiles sales to "rogue" regimes like Iran, ensuring verified compliance with international obligation on nuclear safeguards, and reducing conventional military forces along the border with South Korea.
So America is committed to what can only be called "conditional engagement" with the North as part of its global campaign against international terrorism and weapons of mass destruction.
The "Sunshine Policy" is on the defensive in South Korean domestic politics, too.
The unilateral and persistent way in which President Kim and his associates pursued their opening to the North caused enormous divisiveness on an issue over which the country was usually very united.
Opponents of Mr. Kim's policy point out that the South keeps making concessions without gaining anything from the North in return.
During last month's local government campaign, indeed, Mr. Lee Hoi-Chang, the opposition Grand National Party Candidate for president, repeatedly emphasized the principle of reciprocity and vowed to abrogate the "Kim/Kim" summit agreement if Kim Jong Il's government continued to insist that the South accept the North's terms for the constitutional construction of a reunified Korea.
President Kim Dae Jung's opponents romped to victory in a landslide that suggests the unpopularity of his policies.
There is little doubt that the naval confrontation in which four South Korean sailors were killed further damaged President Kim's credibility on policy toward the North.
President Kim himself demanded an apology, but the North only accused South Korea of initiating an armed provocation against it.
Unless the North reverses this position, President Kim's efforts to stick to the "Sunshine Policy" will look increasingly weak in the eyes of South Korea's public.
Such a perception will make it hard for his successor - whoever he is - to revitalize the "Sunshine Policy" even if he wants to do so.
Despite its seeming slow death, the "Sunshine Policy" did deliver benefits.
Primarily, it opened North Korea to South Korea and the world.
As a result, North Korea has begun to enter the international system and its dependence on South Korea, the US, China and other donors has deepened.
But it is also true that this opening failed to change North Korea's behavior in any fundamental way.
China Must Do More than Mediate
Despair is dangerous in diplomacy.
But North Korea's latest actions are making much of Asia hopeless.
Only China, long reluctant to flex its diplomatic muscles, now has the power to find a diplomatic solution to the North Korean nuclear problem.
But the question everyone from Tokyo to Seoul and from Washington to Moscow is asking is this: will China act in time?
China's influence on North Korea is uniquely powerful.
China is keeping its increasingly desperate neighbor on life support by providing most of the non-food aid and energy that North Korea receives from abroad.
But to prevent North Korea from realizing a fait accompli in its pursuit of nuclear weapons, China must do more than mediate between North Korea and the US, the role it has so far played.
Instead, it must now prompt North Korea to halt its nuclear development activities and return to the six-party talks with America, Japan, China, Russia, and South Korea that broke up weeks ago.
Recent developments indicate that North Korea's nuclear threat is becoming more serious by the day.
Two weeks ago, North Korea declared that in June it successfully reprocessed some 8,000 spent nuclear fuel rods and now possesses "nuclear deterrence," suggesting that Kim Jong Il's regime may actually be making atomic bombs.
Not only does North Korea show little interest in holding another session of the six-party talks that the Bush administration and the other participants are calling for; it now wants to ban the Japanese from participating.
Kim accuses Japan of introducing unnecessary obstacles and complications into resolution of the nuclear question by raising the sensitive issue of North Korea's abduction of Japanese citizens.
But this is nothing more than a political diversion.
It is inconceivable that multilateral negotiations could result in a breakthrough toward a diplomatic solution while North Korea is actively engaged in pursuing its nuclear weapons program.
It must be clear by now that Pyongyang is determined to keep its nuclear weapons program in order to obtain a credible assurance from the US that its bizarre and repressive regime will be allowed to survive.
Unless America accommodates North Korea's demands for concluding a nonaggression treaty and ending "hostile" policies, Kim's regime is likely to keep its nuclear weapons program as its most effective deterrent against any preemptive US attack--something that the Bush administration, indeed, refuses to rule out.
America's military victory in the war in Iraq probably hardened North Korea's resolve to rely on the nuclear option as its primary means of ensuring regime survival.
But that should not surprise anyone: the North Korean regime has always been committed to making military power the "first priority" in the state budget.
This contrasts sharply with policies pursued by China and Vietnam, Asia's two other communist powers.
In both countries, the leadership places military power last in their national development strategies.
It would be difficult for the US to change the highest priority of its own national security strategy--preempting terrorism and fighting the spread of weapons of mass destruction--especially with another nuclear threat looming in Iran.
Insofar as the goal of preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula is concerned, the US has thus succeeded by sustaining an ad hoc concert of powers thus far with China, Japan, Russia, and South Korea.
Indeed, in their first-ever joint declaration, Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao, Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, and South Korean President Roh Moo Hyun issued a plea on the sidelines of the ASEAN summit held in Bali on October 8 for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
All sides realize that failure to achieve this would most likely result in a nuclear chain reaction with Japan, South Korea, and perhaps even Taiwan embarking on their own nuclear weapons development programs.
That scenario is China's worst nightmare.
So the question now is what can China do to freeze--and, if possible, to reverse--North Korea's nuclear program.
China finds itself in a delicate position, pulled in one direction by its desire to avoid a precipitous North Korean collapse, and in the opposite direction by its overriding need to deepen economic relations with the US, Japan, and South Korea.
This is why at the UN Security Council China opposed any military action or sanctions against North Korea, a country for which it sacrificed almost one million troops during the Korean War in 1950-53.
It is in China's vital national interest to halt North Korea's quest to become another declared nuclear power.
China's success here would not only enhance its own international prestige, but would also contribute immensely to promoting regional stability and prosperity throughout East Asia.
The same is true of the reported intention of some EU governments to have the so-called "Privileged Partnership" concept explicitly included in the negotiating framework as an alternative to full membership.
This proposal was discussed at last December's European Council meeting and rejected, resulting in a reference to "open-ended negotiations" in the Council's conclusions.
That wording -- never used in previous enlargement rounds -- may have ruffled Turkey's feathers, but it was finally accepted as the type of constructive ambiguity that is so often used in international diplomacy.
It is nonetheless obvious from the very nature of accession negotiations that full membership must be the goal.
Without that prospect, no candidate country would go through the painful process of adopting the tens of thousands of rules and regulations contained in the Acquis Communautaire (the body of EU law).
To ensure that it does, is, after all, the main purpose of accession talks.
Moreover, it is difficult to imagine what advantages could be offered to Turkey in the framework of a "Privileged Partnership" beyond its long-time status as an Associate Member of the EU.
The Customs Union concluded ten years ago allows free trade for all but agricultural goods.
Turkey is invited to Council meetings, it can participate in various EU programs and in manifestations of the European Common Foreign Policy, and, as a member of NATO, it is a partner in EU-NATO security cooperation.
Finally, like all candidate countries, Turkey also receives financial and technical assistance in support of ongoing reform programs.
Short of full membership, there is hardly room for added value in Turkey's relationship with the EU.
Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn has spelt it out with the necessary clarity: "If we stick to what we have ourselves decided at the highest political level in the European Council, as we should, I am reasonably confident that the negotiations shall start on the October 3."
This statement is to the credit of the European Commission, and there is not much to be added, except to emphasize that it is up to EU governments to treat Turkey with the fairness that all candidate countries deserve.
To renege on formal decisions and commitments, or to add last-minute obstacles, would make a mockery of the Union's credibility.
Negotiations therefore must begin on October 3.  
Kosovo is Europe's Responsibility
Unfortunately, however, we still cannot turn the page on this pernicious conflict, which has led to so much tragedy and has been a cause of instability in the Balkans for far too long.
The issue will not go away, because Serbia persists in its rejection of the new reality, and is doing everything in its power to prevent normalization.
On orders from Serbia's government, Kosovo Serbs, who represent some 5% of the population, refuse to cooperate with Kosovo's government and the EU mission.
In doing so -- and this is the irony of the matter -- Serbs themselves are preventing the early implementation of the wide-ranging community rights foreseen in the Ahtisaari Plan, which would bring to them a normal and secure life.
On the international level, Serbia -- with strong support from Russia -- is actively engaged in blocking Kosovo's accession to the United Nations and other global or regional organizations.
It is difficult to comprehend what Serbia aims to achieve.
Nobody will deny that, for any state, being separated from part of its territory is a painful matter -- even if a different ethnic group largely populates that territory.
Still, there are examples in recent history when this has been achieved in a consensual manner.
In the case of Kosovo, after the Milosevic regime's brutal behavior in the 1990's -- including repression, massive human rights violations, and large-scale expulsions of Kosovo Albanians -- prompted NATO to intervene and the UN to take over the country's administration, return to Serbian rule became unthinkable.
Serbia's democratic leaders of today must understand that the loss of Kosovo -- although not their doing -- is an irreversible reality with which they must come to terms.
All they can achieve with their current policy of rejection is to delay the much-needed stabilization of the region following the break-up of Yugoslavia, and to make life miserable for Kosovo and its people.
Would it not be wiser to give a helping hand to the infant state, turning hostility into friendship and thus securing the future presence of Serbs in Kosovo?
Kosovo is, first of all, a European problem, and the EU has the primary responsibility to turn it into a success story.
Regrettably, the Union's inability to agree on a common policy has not only weakened its role on the international level, but has also become a major obstacle to determined action in the country itself.
The five member states that continue to withhold recognition of Kosovo should be aware that their stance encourages those who reject the EU mission any cooperation and impede its work.
It also makes it infinitely more difficult for moderate forces in Serbia to adjust to the new situation.
Only a unified EU position, combined with the knowledge that EU accession for Serbia is unthinkable as long as this conflict has not been fully resolved, may over time lead to a change of attitude on the part of both ordinary Serbs and their government.
Kosovo, on the other hand, needs a clear European perspective and unhesitating help to meet the daunting challenges it is facing.
At the moment, both are missing.
Nobody should be misled by the relative calm now prevailing in Kosovo.
The Balkans' recent tragedies have shown that problems that remain unresolved sooner or later turn into open conflict, and that the costs become unbearable for all.
There is no time for complacency.
Those concerned should take to heart what American President Barack Obama said in his inaugural speech: "Our time for standing pat, for protecting narrow interests and putting off unpleasant decisions -- that time has surely passed."
India's Agony
Because the denizens of this netherworld know neither patriotism nor morality, they are easily lured into partnership with terrorists, particularly when they have reason to feel aggrieved.
In Mumbai, a large proportion of them are Muslims who were denied space in the formal economy and have developed strong vested interests over the past 50 years.
Details about the Mumbai outrage, where terrorists killed over 100 people, are still unfolding.
But we do know that at least 30 men armed with AK47 rifles and grenades held India's business and financial center hostage, targeting both Indians and foreigners, particularly Americans and British.
It is likely that this operation was propelled from Pakistan through the Lashkar e Tauba, a terrorist organization sustained by hatred of secular India and backed by shadowy Pakistani agencies and street support.
In the blood and drama of the events, however, we might miss a significant element of the story.
The attacks were an operation that must have required months of planning: serious weapons were deployed, a small army was mobilized, targets were studied, transport was organized, and weak points identified.
A plan of attack that involved hundreds of people was put in motion, and yet the massive infrastructure of India's government discovered nothing.
The chief of India's Anti-Terrorist Squad, Hemant Karkare (who lost his life in the battles that raged through the night) received a death threat from the nearby city of Pune, but his own unit did not bother to investigate it, since it was busy playing games on behalf of its political masters.
Complacency and politics gave the terrorists more protection than silence or camouflage ever could.
Indeed, the attacks represent more than a failure of police work.
They represent a collapse of governance; these are the wages of the sins of administrative incompetence and political malfeasance.
India is a tough nation.
No one should have illusions about that.
It has fought off Muslim terrorists in Kashmir, Sikh terrorists in Punjab, Christian terrorists in Nagaland, and Hindu terrorists in Assam and across the country.
It understands that you cannot blame the whole community for the sins of a few.
But under ineffectual governance, particularly during the last three years, India is in danger of degenerating into a soft state.
Instead of being an international leader in the worldwide war against terrorism, it is sinking into the despair of a perpetual victim.
Indeed, India stands only behind Iraq in the number of people killed each year in terrorist attacks.
Three years ago, Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh rather smugly told President George W. Bush in Delhi that Indian Muslims were not involved in any act of terrorism.
The implication was that the integration of Muslims in Indian society constituted a success story.  Muslims, Singh implied, also benefit from the virtues of democracy, a conclusion that Bush happily repeated.
But Singh certainly did not fool any of the terrorists, some of whom may have read his self-congratulation as a challenge for them to act.
I am an Indian and a Muslim and proud to be both.
Like any Indian, today I am angry, frustrated, and depressed.
I am angry at the manic dogs of war who have invaded Mumbai.
I am frustrated by the impotence of my government in Mumbai and Delhi, tone-deaf to the anguish of my fellow citizens.
And I am depressed at the damage being done to the idea of India.
Putin's Ark
Recently I visited Moscow after five years away.
The city, which looked different and strange, impressed me by its ability to change.
My days back in Russia were divided between official meetings, hours wasted in traffic jams, and nights spent with old friends who tried to show me the best of Moscow nightlife.
On my first free evening, I was invited to a place called "Shinok."
The restaurant had many of the traits found in ethnic restaurants everywhere.
Different bits of kitsch, this time Ukrainian, were richly represented.
But the interior decoration had one unique element -- an artificial wall with windows separating a part of the restaurant hall.
Behind the wall was a stage set of a village yard.
A real cow, as well as chickens and geese populated that ersatz farmyard. At times an old woman in traditional dress appeared to feed the animals.
Visitors enjoying borscht and pirogi observed her efforts with satisfaction.
"She works for the restaurant," my acquaintance explained. "She feeds animals and sits in the yard to create the rustic ambiance."
Shinok was just an introduction to today's new wave of Moscow restaurant culture.
A few days later, I visited "The White Sun of the Desert," another ethnic hangout.
The White Sun existed in Soviet times.
Back then, it was called "Uzbekistan" and was nothing more than an obligatory culinary demonstration of the supposedly unbreakable union of the USSR's fifteen fraternal republics.
Although the restaurant interior had completely changed since then, its decorative themes remained the same.
Nowadays, however, the establishment is named after a popular Soviet borscht-western (or "eastern") filmed in 1969 and set in Central Asia during the 1919 Civil War.
The restaurant is decorated not only with oriental carpets, but with life-size figures of the movie's heroes firing machine guns or sitting on crates of dynamite.
This Soviet "orientalism" is reinforced by pretty waitresses dressed in sexy outfits more inspired by the Arabian Nights than by any Central Asian reality -- then or now.
But the Soviet past, not ethnic motifs, are the biggest element in contemporary Muscovite restaurant design.
The club-restaurant "Major Pronin:" is conveniently located in the vicinity of the KGB-FSB headquarters.
It is named after the hero of bad Soviet-era spy novels, a figure who was also the butt of many underground jokes.
The restaurant's interior is decorated with various pieces of espionage equipment.
But the main attraction is a shooting gallery where patrons can test their skills between courses.
Targets depicting serial killers and drug dealers have mottos like "Save a woman" or "Save a boy" on them.
In the middle of the wall is a target representing New York's World Trade Center being approached by an aircraft, with the inscription "Save America."
A new club called "Zone" -- Russian slang for a concentration camp -- is designed to reproduce the feeling of gulag life.
Barking Alsatian dogs, stern guards, and waiters dressed in inmate uniforms work hard to recreate the gulag's sinister atmosphere.
Russian literature is not forgotten.
If the restaurant "Pushkin" on Tverskoy Boulevard not far from the monument to the great Russian poet is designed to recreate the "aristocratic atmosphere" of the early nineteenth century, the combined bar and diner called "Gogol" on Stoleshnikov Lane is an attempt to recreate a vanished Soviet institution called "rumochnaia." A "rumka" is a vodka glass from which exhausted proletarians could revive themselves.
Of course "rumochnaia" had nothing in common with Nikolai Gogol, but the establishment named after the famous writer does have a skating rink that is used once a day by a man dressed up as Gogol.
After my return to Washington, I had a dinner with an American politician who had just visited Saint Petersburg.
As a special honor, his Russian hosts organized an excursion to Strelna, the "Russian Versailles," which was recently restored from ruin to become the Petersburg residence of President Vladimir Putin.
The palace didn't impress the American.
The amount of marble used for renovation seemed excessive, and the understanding of what constitutes luxury appeared to correspond to the standards of a Holiday Inn.
The American's excited Russian hosts asked him constantly for his opinion of the palace.
Throughout the tour, the American answered with polite exclamations like "exquisite" or "striking."
Finally, they reached the attic.
At last, the American was excited.
The attic of the presidential residence was designed as a belly of the seventeenth-century ship. "The last time I saw something like this was in a Hamburg beer hall in the 1960's," the politician told me.
How perfect, I thought, as I imagined Russia's president climbing the stairs to the attic of his palace to play the role of Peter the Great.
Like the customers in that Ukrainian-style village restaurant, perhaps Putin found his attic ark reassuring in some unconscious way.
A historical wave beyond his control had lifted the former KGB lieutenant colonel from out of the shadows to the pinnacle of power.
But fate might also just as suddenly wash him away.
What could be better than to have an ark at hand if one day the political tides turn?

Rushdie a la Russe
June will be a cruel month in Russia's courts.
On June 16th, the rebellious oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky and his comrade-in-arms Platon Lebedev finally began to face the judges of the Meshchansky district court.
No doubt, this case will attract the Russian and international press.
Hearings began just the day before Khodorkovsky's trial opened in another case that is no less significant.
But this case is not about oligarchs trying to interfere in politics; it is about a group of artists and curators whose professional activities have unexpectedly turned into a political hot potato.
In January 2003, a gang of Russian Orthodox activists destroyed an exhibition in the Sakharov Museum and Public Center called "Caution!
Religion."
The organizers of the exhibition stated that they wanted to attract attention to the new role of religious institutions in Russian life.
But the Orthodox fundamentalists found the art blasphemous and offensive, and some trashed the exhibition.
Last December, prosecutors charged two Sakharov Museum officials and three of the exhibition's organizers with inciting religious hatred.
They now face prison terms of up to five years.
The vandals, meanwhile, were hailed by church officials as heroes.
All charges against them were dismissed.
The vandals had influential protectors.
All of them were members of the congregation of St. Nicholas in Pyzhi, whose archpriest, Alexander Shargunov, is a well-known radical fundamentalist.
In 1997, he established a movement called the Social Committee For the Moral Revival of the Fatherland.
In 2001, the committee's Web site carried instructions on how to vandalize "immoral" billboards by splashing paint on them.
Followers promptly destroyed 150 billboards in Moscow.
A group of well-known nationalist intellectuals, including film director Nikita Mikhalkov, artist Ilya Glazunov, and writers Valentin Rasputin and Vasily Belov, weighed in with a petition calling the exhibition a "new stage of conscious Satanism."
They wrote that Russia's enemies were bent on humiliating the powerless "Russian people, their objects of worship, and their historic values."
Who, precisely, were these powerful enemies?
The intellectuals didn't identify them, but the fascist political party Pamyat (Memory) did not hesitate.
The appeal posted on its Web site called on Orthodox Christians to protect "our Lord Jesus Christ" from "Yid-degenerates," using the most derogatory Russian term for Jews.
These alarming events in the art world have taken place against a background of rising nationalism and Orthodox assertiveness in Russia.
The Orthodox Church has acquired enormous political clout in recent years, and few politicians risk offending it.
The Sakharov Museum exhibition was subjected to a vituperative media campaign, and the matter was almost immediately taken up in the Duma, where nationalist deputies vied with each other to denounce the artists and laud the vandals.
In February 2003, the Duma passed a decree stating that the Sakharov museum exhibition's purpose was to incite religious hatred and to insult believers and the Orthodox Church.
The state prosecutor was ordered to take action against the organizers, with 265 of 267 deputies approving the measure.
In April 2003, the Duma voted to toughen the law against inciting religious hatred by adding prison terms of up to five years for offenders.
In December 2003, Sakharov Museum director Yuri Samodurov was charged with actions "leading to the provocation of hatred and enmity."
If found guilty, he could be sentenced to up to five years in prison.
Church officials are not calling for that harsh a penalty.
In March 2004, the Moscow Patriarchy's External Relations Department issued a statement that surprised everyone.
It asserted, in effect, that the Sakharov Museum exhibition organizers had committed an administrative rather than a criminal offense.
The difference is that administrative offenses are punished with fines, at most, not prison terms.
Such a softening of the church's position was probably the result of the public outcry in Russia's liberal press.
Yet the pogrom at the Sakharov museum provoked a chain reaction of similar attacks on contemporary art by Orthodox fundamentalists whom the church has been unable to control.
Anna Alchuk, an artist who participated in the exhibition in the Sakaharov Center and was later charged, said she had read all 14 volumes of evidence collected by the prosecutor, and that 11 volumes consisted entirely of letters from "working people" expressing outrage at the show and demanding that the artists be punished.
Almost none of the writers had seen the exhibition - most had signed form letters. "The events around the exhibition discredit the Russian Orthodox Church, just as the fatwah condemning Salman Rushdie to death discredited Islam," said Elena Bonner, Andrei Sakharov's widow.
The outcome of the court hearings is difficult to predict, but it will answer the question of whether Russians have lost the freedom artistic self-expression that they gained after communism's fall.
Disillusion with "democracy Boris Yeltsin-style" has pushed President Vladimir Putin to search for an ideology based on nationalism and the glorification of the state.
Putin calls it "managed pluralism."
As we can now see, the Social Committee For the Moral Revival of the Fatherland wants to be among the managers.
The Globalization of Science
For example, we know that someone who smokes two packs of cigarettes a day is likely to have a serious problem with cancer some 40 years later.
And science predicts that, unless we severely constrain consumption of oil and coal around the world, the climate will continue to warm, increasing ocean volume and melting huge amounts of ice in the Arctic and Antarctic -- thereby causing disastrous rises in sea level.
These are but two examples of thousands of instances in which it makes good sense for decision-makers to take into account what science can predict about the future.
And yet, what science knows is far too often overlooked when high-stakes decisions are made.
This is not to say that scientists should dominate the government decision-making process.
It is the business of politicians, not scientists, to consider the relative costs and benefits of the options before them, weighing them as they see fit in reaching their conclusions.
For example, the United States government is well-served by an organization called the National Academies, based on three honorary organizations composed of the nation's most distinguished scientists, engineers, and health professionals (the National Academy of Sciences, National Academy of Engineering, and Institute of Medicine, respectively).
This independent, non-governmental organization produces more than 200 reports a year, most in response to specific requests from the US government.
These requests range from questions about the health hazards of trace amounts of arsenic in drinking water, to questions about how best to support various forms of scientific research.
Through a rigorous review process, the Academies insist that each report be limited to what science can say about the subject based on evidence and logic, without preempting the decisions that need to be made by others.
Thus, for example, the report on drinking water predicted the frequency of bladder cancers that would eventually occur in a population exposed to levels of five, 10, or 20 parts per billion of arsenic.
But it did not say what maximum arsenic concentration the government should legislate.
The full text of some 3,000 reports by the Academies are available online (at
However, there are other important science-based issues that require study by internationally-based organizations in order to be widely accepted.
Its the Size of the Market, not the Country that Counts
ROME: Talk of globalization, of a global economy, is unavoidable.
But at the same time that the world witnessed the growth of this economy, it also saw incredible political fragmentation.
In 1946 there were 76 independent nations, by 1996 there were 192.
Of these, more than half had populations under 6 million; 58, less than 2 ˝ million; and 35, less than ˝ million.
Size does not seem to determine a country's success.
Small countries -- say, Singapore and Taiwan -- have grown a lot, and large countries, too, have grown.
Take Japan, despite its recent setbacks, and China in recent decades.
There are small countries -- Haiti, for example -- as well as large -- Nigeria -- where the economies are basket cases.
So the size of countries does not seem to influence growth.
Instead, its the size of the market that influences growth.
In an autarkic economic system with international commerce reduced to the minimum, the political size of the country corresponds to the size of its market. In the global economy, the market is the rest of the world: the size of the market and the political size of each country are entirely independent.
In today's global economy small countries can prosper quietly trading with the rest of the world: there does not exist any advantage in terms of the size of the domestic market.
With free international commerce, small regions have smaller costs in becoming independent. For this reason, ethnic, linguistic, and religious groups can find it more convenient to secede, if they do not have to bare the costs of finding themselves within an economy and a market that are too small.
Clearly, the increase of the number of countries in Eastern Europe is due primarily to the fall of the Soviet Union.
Many small countries in that part of the world, however, may not have been large enough to survive in a less integrated world economy.
Globalization allowed small postcommunist countries (say, the Baltics) to exist and begin to prosper, at least relatively.
Also the Czech Republic (10 million inhabitants) and the Slovak Republic (5 million) which separated peacefully would not have succeeded if their economies depended on the old Czechoslovak market, and not on the rest of the world.
It is no accident that countries in Eastern Europe are anxious to have access to the common market of Western Europe.
Quebec, the French-speaking Canadian region, has for many years been on the point of seceding from Canada.
One argument in favor of the separatist choice is that an independent Quebec will belong to the North American Free Trade Area (NAFTA).
Not accidentally, Quebec separatists are among NAFTA's most enthusiastic boosters.
In Africa it is also probable that we will see other secessions (perhaps soon in Nigeria?).
Ethnic conflicts in that part of the world are at the basis of political instability, and of many economic failures: given that it is now possible to be small and prosper, one of the principal costs of secessions has been removed.
So it may be better to have smaller countries than larger countries subject to unresolved (and perhaps insoluble) ethnic conflicts.
The difficulty is in the fact that it is not always easy to divide peacefully ethnic and religious groups and to redraw boundaries.
Recent experiences in Rwanda and Yugoslavia are a sad example.
In this race between economic integration and political separatism Europe is in the process of unifying itself.
So is Europe bucking history?
In order to answer this question one has to clarify that there are two ways of interpreting the nature of the European Union.
One of these is that Europe is undergoing a profound economic and monetary integration.
The second is that it is undergoing a political unification, i.e., forming into something like the United States of Europe.
Despite the acceleration of European integration, regionalism inside many European countries has not diminished.
Basques, Catalans, Walloons, Scots, Bretons, etc. are no less regionalist today than yesterday.
On the contrary.
Therefore, while monetary and, in part, political unification is progressing on the European level, regionalism, federalist, and separatist impulses survive and prosper.
This means that the first scenario is more realistic: an integrated monetary and economic area with the maximum political independence of the regions.
Europe as an area of economic integration would not be "anti-historical," provided that Europe does not become a fortress closed to the rest of the world.
The United States of Europe, on the other hand, would be an anti-historical process.
In a truly integrated European and global economy there is no need for nations with different languages, traditions, and preferences to unite and coordinate a series of economic policies.
The market coordinates, not the bureaucrats of Brussels.
A small or a large country in Europe has only a need for a free and a functioning world market, and for internal competition in order to prosper.
European Community directives are useless.
The only thing for which Europe has a need is more freedom of the market and more competition, not more European bureaucrats and another level of government superimposed over national, regional, and local governments.
The Euro: At the Crossroads So Soon?
ROME: Six weeks into the Euro's life, Europe's economic policies are out of whack.
Europe has high public debts, taxes near 50% of national product, and years of high unemployment and mediocre growth.
So what's the response?
A tilt toward monetary rigidity and an expansive fiscal policy through a creeping abandonment of the EU Stability Pact.
In addition, proposed employment strategies will do little to reduce labor market rigidity.
Europe craves the opposite mix: more monetary flexibility, fiscal policies that reduce taxation and national debt, and a labor policy that makes Europe's labor markets more akin to America's.
These three cardinal policies are related.
Monetary Policy.
The European Central Bank (ECB) pursues price stability defined as annual inflation of around 1%.
At this delicate moment in the world economy the ECB is seeking to establish its anti-inflation credibility at the very moment when the spectre of deflation is appearing for the first time in half-a-century.
Debtors worldwide face a risk of bankruptcy which, if widespread, could lead to a dangerous recession.
The ECB's choice, strangely, focuses more on its own anti-inflation posture than deflation.
Compare European monetary policy with American actions.
America's Fed follows a rule of monetary policy whereby the prime objective of controlling inflation permits, according to precise parameters, a reaction to changes in the rate of growth.
This policy works, leading to a long period of stable, uninterrupted growth.
The ECB should follow a similar course.
So, what should be the objective regarding inflation?
Price growth of, say, 3% per annum (instead of 1) has clear additional costs, but may facilitate the adjustment of relative prices and wages across Europe.
This does not mean that collective bargaining agreements do not take into account inflation, but only that at a micro level a little inflation permits more "flexibility" in relative real wages.
Fiscal Policy.
Europe must reduce the deadweight of debt and taxes.
How?
By reducing primary expenses, then reducing taxes.
But European politicians, of right and left, believe that public expenditures are the engine of growth.
Wrong: economies grow with more markets not with more public expenditures.
Ireland, the European country with the highest rate of growth is also the one that most reduced its deficit and public debt by cutting expenditures and taxes.
Elsewhere in Europe, there is talk about abandoning the Stability Pact before the Pact even goes into effect.
For example: we no longer hear about cutting Italy's public debt in half (in relation to GDP).
In fact Italy's government was among the first to support the idea of jettisoning the Stability Pact, and had to be rebuked by the EU Commission for "over optimistic" budget projections.
Germany, too, has traveled far from its anti-inflationary obsessions.
Minister Lafontaine seems to love inflation and public debt without thinking about the consequences.
France's socialist government continues to believe, despite contrary evidence, that a vast, centralized public sector is compatible with a dynamic market economy.
Widespread ideas about major public investments financed by bloating deficits should be forgotten.
Public infrastructure investments displace private investments and the taxes necessary to finance them introduce further distortions in demand.
In any case, the lions share of public expenditures goes to pensions, transfers, and public sector salaries.
Without drastic reform of the social state, European fiscal policy will continue to have feet of clay.
Labor Policy.
Every few weeks European ministers proclaim new initiatives concerning "labor policy."
Most are useless.
The only employment policy that makes sense reduces fiscal burdens on the cost of labor and increases flexibility in the market.
Consider this: in Italy in the last 10 years the cost of each job is equal to 1.7 of the average salary; the average in other countries of EMU is around 1.4; the same number for the United States is around 1.25.
These numbers tell only part of the story.
Increases in income taxes imply that unions demand higher gross salaries in order to compensate for the fall in net salaries due to tax increases.
Therefore income taxes, in part, impact the cost of labor, contributing to high unemployment.
In fact, average unemployment in the countries of the EU in the last 10 years is around 10%.
Today it is still high, while in the US it was around 6% and is now 4.5%.
Europe is trapped in a vicious circle: those employed recoil from more flexibility and the risk of losing their jobs.
But unemployment is high because of taxes and excessive protection for those employed, which prevents the market from creating new employment opportunities.
So the unemployed ask for more social protection, instead of flexibility, increasing the fiscal drain on the economy.
Given lax fiscal discipline, the ECB will likely react with more monetary rigidity, pushing politicians, already enamored with the social state, to spend and tax even more.
Europe and the euro face a crossroads.
One road is where the ECB digs in its heels on price stability and politicians forget about fiscal discipline and the fact that a market economy cannot work with half of GDP absorbed by taxes.
Such a combination would force the ECB to be even more rigid in an economy where the employed and their representatives (trade unions) are preoccupied exclusively with protecting existing jobs and excluding outsiders, i.e. the unemployed.
The other road reduces the fiscal burden of the social state, reinvigorating the economy by reducing taxes and providing the employed not with social protection but with more assurance of finding another job if they lose their current one.
If Europe takes this road, monetary policy could help by assuring the minimal stabilization of cyclical fluctuations, without having to keep nominal interest at too high a level.
The first road is that of eurosclerosis, the second takes the best of what the US can teach Europe.
The Two-Faced Economy
ROME: Italy's economy has two faces.
On one side, sectors of the economy demonstrate extraordinary productivity, and have won big shares of international markets.
For example, the mechanical industries in the Veneto and in Emilia led by Carararo, and Ducati, as well as the optical industry in the Northeast with Luxottica in the lead.
These are firms known across the globe, and which are often the objects of acquisitive interest from foreign competitors or great international investors, such as Piaggio and Stefanel.
On the other hand, Italy's economy as a whole is stagnant: in the last ten years Italy has been growing more slowly than the median in Europe, which is already seeing much lower growth rates than the United States.
In the last eight years per capita GDP has increased, on average, by 3.2% per year in America, 2% in Europe, and only 1.2% in Italy.
How are these two economic facts to be reconciled and what does this divided economy tell us about Europe, east and west, as well as other economies where the percentage of people in work may be stagnant or falling?
The answer is at the same time simple and rich in consequences for economic policy.
GDP per capita (that is, GDP divided by the total population) depends on two factors: the productivity of those who work (that is, GDP divided by the number of people employed), and the number of people who work as a proportion of the population.
In order for an increase in the productivity of those who work to result in a growth of GDP per capita it is necessary that productivity growth not be not nullified by a simultaneous reduction in the number, and thus the proportion, of those who work.
Such a reduction happens not only when unemployment goes up, but also when the number of those who do not participate in the labor force grows: students, retired people, the unemployed who are discouraged and stop looking for work and so abandon the labor force.
In Italy, the country's stagnant GDP masks two phenomena which cancel each other out.
Productivity grows due to the expansion of the most dynamic and efficient firms, but the percentage of those who work is decreasing all the time.
The result is that the productive sectors of the economy do not succeed in "pulling" with them the ever greater mass of people who do not work.
Data on labor force participation is almost incredible.
The ratio of the labor force (that is those who are employed and those unemployed who are actively looking for work) to the number of people of working age is equal to 75% in USA, 76% in Great Britain, around 68% in France and Germany, and 58% in Italy.
This is the lowest number in all of the European Union.
Among OECD countries, the only one with a percentage of participation in the economy lower than that of Italy is Turkey, where 53% of the population makes up the labor force.
Considering that the Italian 58% includes the unemployed, only about half of Italians of working age are now working or even looking for work.
This percentage is lower today than in 1970, while in the United States the equivalent number has increased from 65% to 78%.
True, a small part of the near half of the population who officially do not work are employed in the underground economy, but this is small consolation; certainly it is not in those sectors that the future of the Italian economy is to be found.
What accounts for this propensity of people not to look for work, and why does what is happening in Italy matter to other countries?
First of all, an extremely generous system of retirement benefits makes the "no work" option attractive, though not quite obligatory.
Indeed, abandoning work at an ever younger age relative to the longer life expectancy of Italians is something particularly worrying.
In the second place, low labor force participation is a response to the heightened fiscal pressure that results from the burden of having to pay for all the retirement pensions of today's fifty-year-olds.
The pressure affects those who do work and, because of the heavier tax burden, makes work less attractive for them, especially for the second members of a family.
When a man works and marginal tax rates are very high, the wife very often prefers to stay at home.
Finally, the propensity not to look for work results from a university system that accepts anyone and which does not offer any disincentive to those who seek to indefinitely prolong their so-called "studies."
This state of affairs is reproduced inside individual families: young people of 30 survive thanks to the work of the head of the family, who supports everyone.
Reform of the pension system is often attacked as a zero-sum game, in which whatever one person loses another gains.
Put in these terms, the problem is always solved by giving more to those who have the most political power.
Professor Nicola Rossi, economic advisor to Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema, in the title of his recent book, expresses the wish that we give "Less to the Fathers and More to the Sons."
But if unions are powerful or seniors are in the majority (in Italy the two coincide, because seniors are the majority in all labor unions), the exact opposite happens.
Italy's recent budget, which neither confronted the pensions issue nor the issue of fiscal reform, demonstrates this fully.
Here is the grand delusion of the budget and the Finance Ministry in Italy.
Neither seems capable, and in fact neither has tried to understand, that we are not dealing with a zero some gain.
Those countries who also provide disincentives to work should keep Italy's sluggishness in mind and learn the lessons Italy's government has ignored.
Bursting the Bubble
ROME: "Get-rich-quick": for thousands of people around the world, that is what investing in the stock market means nowadays.
Old people invest their savings and pensions from home computers; young men and women give up working for salaries to seek a big pay-off in the stock options on offer from dot.com firms.
Given the global market tumult of the past ten days, examining the historical data about the performance of stock markets is a mandatory sobering experience for investors old and new and everywhere.
In the United States over the past 100 years, investments in stocks delivered an average 6% more than safe investments in short-term government securities.
This differential has been quite stable over time, although between 1947 and 1994 it was slightly higher at 8%.
The numbers are similar in other countries.
In Italy between 1961 and 1994, for example, stock investments brought an average return of around 6% more than investments in treasury securities.
Certainly, there have been extraordinary periods, such as the 1950s, when the differential between investing in the stock exchange in Milan and treasury securities climbed to over 22%.
But there were also unlucky periods; in the next decade (1961-1970), when the average differential was -2%.
Higher returns mean higher risks.
It is as simple as that.
If, instead of investing in the Standard & Poor index of 500 largest companies quoted on Wall Street, an investor put his savings in small, and often more innovative, companies (the so-called "small caps"), his return would have gone up in the last 50 years by 6% -- i.e. by a mere15% over the return on ultra-safe government securities.
But the risks that investor faced would also have doubled, for the volatility of returns on short-term government securities was 3% during the same 50 years, but a whopping 17% for the S&P index, and 30% for small cap stocks.
This 30% figure means that, in any one year, the probability that the return on one's investment was going to be 30% higher than the return on government securities was equal to the probability that it would be 30% lower.
Given that in the same period American government securities brought, net of inflation, a little less than 2% return, this means that the return on small cap stocks had the probability, in any given year of delivering a +32% or -28% return.
In other words, long-term investments in stocks do yield more than investments in government securities, but the heightened volatility means that decades must pass before we can safely conclude that an average stock investment has indeed brought higher returns.
The history of "new economy" stocks is too short to allow anyone to say whether the extraordinary performance of the stock exchanges in more or less all countries over the last few years is a temporary speculative boom, or an irreversible result of the new economy.
Until now, even considering recent gyrations, almost all stock exchanges have been rising at breakneck speed.
Annuals return in Italy, for example, between Christmas and the end of the first quarter of this year was 120%.
But the greater volatility of the last few weeks saw the index of new European stocks lose at least 30% of its value.
Here is a powerful signal that the old relationship between returns and volatility is reasserting itself.
The fear now, however, is that a new generation of investors, including those who invest from their computers at home and who never experienced a negative performance of the market, is underestimating the risks.
In the United States, where the boom has lasted the longest, many observers have no doubt that the market is in a bubble.
Looking at price earning ratios on Wall Street, Robert Shiller, an economist at Yale University and one of the most convinced believers in the bull market, observed recently that stocks have never been more overvalued, not even in the summer of 1929, before the Great Crash.
The data, at least for the American economy, certainly shows that the new economy is generating extraordinary productivity increases.
But in light of historical experience, this may not be all that convincing.
Ours is not the first experience of a technological leap; at the previous turn of the century, the world saw the introduction of the electric engine and of the telegraph -- clearly both inventions of comparable significance to the Internet.
Yet, during that period, the differential in returns between stocks and treasury securities was on the order of 6%.
In sum, the lesson of the new economy is not that one becomes rich without any effort, simply by speculating on the stock market.
The new economy teaches us that research, technological innovation, and entrepreneurial spirit in a competitive market -- all things that are not plentiful in Europe -- have a high payoff.
Europe has imported from the United States some of the negative aspects of the market, such as casino-like speculation.
But it has not yet moved toward the more important features of the American economy, such as deregulation of labor and product markets, and a reduction in the weight of the public sector on the economy.
Market falls in America might quickly be overcome because of the underlying strength of the American economy; Europe holds no such underlying strength in reserve.
For individual investors, stocks remain personal risks; for Europe as a whole, bursting any speculative bubble may risk economic stability.
Talking Sensibly About the Euro
ROME: Another week, another crisis for the euro.
This time it is the chairman of the European Central Bank who is under fire.
No matter what causes any one crisis, it is now necessary to discuss the euro's fate without doomsday overtones.
Five points must be emphasized:
• The Europe of the eleven euro members is a much more closed economic system than any of its individual member countries.
Most of the commercial and financial activities of the eleven takes place within the euro area.
Hence, movements in the euro's exchange rate for any single member country of the Euro-11 are much less important, from the standpoint of both benefits and disadvantages, than movements in currencies outside the euro area are to those countries.
The euro area, indeed, is only slightly more open to outside forces than the United States.
The ratio of exports to GDP in the euro area, for example, is about 17%, as opposed to 12% in the US.
The average American doesn't care much about the dollar's external value, yet the value of the euro seems a question of life and death for Europeans.
• The statute of the European Central Bank declares its objective to be maintenance of stable and low inflation in the middle run.
Stabilizing the euro's exchange rate is not the ECB's mission.
Those who criticize the ECB for not intervening more vigorously in capital markets in defense of the euro either have not read the Maastricht Treaty or have forgotten what it says.
Moreover, if the ECB raised interest rates in order to defend the euro, even assuming such intervention might actually work, the ECB would be accused of stifling growth.
The ECB can influence capital markets only if it coordinates its intervention with America's Federal Reserve.
In sum: the ECB is doing its job well as prescribed by its charter; it also serves as a scapegoat for politicians, which isn't in the charter but is something politicians intended all along.
• A low euro, in relation to the dollar, has both pros and cons, and it is not clear that the latter are stronger than the former.
Inflation remains low in Europe.
Europe's mini recovery is -- in part -- due to the euro's devaluation.
A strong yen, we should remember, is associated with a strong Japanese economy.
Likewise, for a relatively large and closed economic system such as Europe, a weak euro provides moderate positive effects on growth and some moderate negative effects in terms of threatening inflation.
Both benefits and demerits, however, are much weaker than in countries that remain outside the euro area.
• Let's be clear: no economist can reliably explain short-term movements in exchange rates.
(If someone did know the cause or causes of such movements, they would probably keep it a secret so as to make a bundle in the market!)
Thus, the various "theories" on why the euro lost value are speculative.
When economists don't know how to explain something, they often invoke the irrationality of markets.
This has two great advantages: it is difficult to test (so proponents of it cannot be easily contradicted) and it permits the economist to watch the "irrational" workings of the market with an air of detached conceit, without having to force himself to understand it.
• European politicians often say that the euro lost value because of the euro zone's lack of political union.
This is another theory that cannot be tested or verified and, in any case, the logic behind it is muddled.
This theory is also dangerous for the stability of the euro.
Political union in Europe (even assuming that we understand what is meant by it) will not take place within a matter of weeks or months.
Even among those inside the euro area, not all subscribe to the idea of a federal Europe.
So if the euro is losing value because political union is lacking, it follows that we should expect a low euro for a long time.
Indeed, the value of the euro would be tied to an event difficult to predict and equally difficult to define.
I leave it to readers to draw the consequences with respect to how an agent of an (irrational?) market should act given the fact that participation in the euro and political union was probably the principal motive for the Denmark's "No" to euro membership and Britain's reluctance.
Bush/Gore: There is a Difference
BOSTON/ROME: Any reader of non-US newspapers could draw two conclusions about America's electoral campaign: 1. that there is little difference between the two candidates; 2. that a mere detail -- a slip of the tongue, a false step, a piece of gossip -- could decide the election.
Both conclusions are wrong.
Start with the first.
Differences between Bush and Gore on economic policy are as deep as those between the right and left in France or Italy.
The cleavage lies in a very different visions about the state and it goes beyond questions about how to divide America's budget surplus between increased spending or cutting taxes.
Bush's Republicans favor increasing disposable family income (by reducing taxes) and more often leaving to the market, the production of goods and services now publicly provided and paid for by the taxpayer, rather than the user.
Gore's Democrats prefer more traditional public management and control.
In public education, Bush favors a system of vouchers administered by individual states.
Through such vouchers, citizens are given a subsidy with which they "purchase" education either from a public or private school.
The idea is that market competition among different educational institutions will increase the quality of education.
Democrats oppose vouchers and prefer major federal investments in order to improve the quality of public schools.
On pensions, Bush advocates a mixed system of pensions, with a private component. The idea is to create more freedom for taxpayers to manage their pension funds, bringing incentives for the allocation of these monies into stocks and bonds.
Gore prefers to maintain the system essentially as it is and to use the budget surplus to eliminate the deficit in the pension system that will open in the second decade of this century, when a wave of baby boomers reaches retirement age.
In other words, Gore sees the pension system as a means to redistribute between rich and poor; Bush sees it more as a "private" system to accumulate individual pension savings.
A similar difference exists in health policy: Bush prefers fiscal relief for taxpayers so that they can buy private medical insurance; Gore prefers public management with more public intervention.
In sum, Americans are confronting fundamental differences about the right type of school, pension, and healthcare for the future.
The fact that in the weeks before the elections the candidates court undecided voters by trying to appear as centrist as possible should surprise no one.
The only area where there doesn't seem to be much difference between the two candidates is foreign policy, and this is a good sign for the world, because it portends stability in America's posture and, above all, cooperation between the two parties even if one of them were to control Congress and the other the Presidency.
Still, there are differences: Gore is more "interventionist"; Bush more cautious and less eager to engage American troops abroad.
The second point regards the way in which the vote will be decided.
The story of presidential elections in the twentieth century goes like this: if a foreign observer had only the following two pieces of data: 1. economic growth during the electoral year and 2. the name of the incumbent president, the observer could foresee with precision the results of presidential elections, independently of the entire campaign.
An incumbent president running for a second term (like Clinton in 1996) has an advantage; beyond that, strong economic growth in the electoral year favors the party of the incumbent president.
All the rest -- scandals large and small, marijuana smoke, and errors of grammar -- divert journalists but influence the results little.
Why, then, do candidates spend enormous amounts on campaigning?
For the same reason that Coca-Cola and Pepsi spend millions to compete -- if both stopped advertising, their market shares would not change much, even if, obviously, it would change if only one of the two engaged in publicity.
In other words, conservative vote for Republicans and those on the left vote for Democrats on the basis of differences in the party programs, those in the middle go from one side to the other on the basis of the state of the economy and perceptions about the "competence" of the incumbent administration.
After WWII the only two incumbent presidents not reelected were Carter in 1980, who ran in the middle of a recession, and Bush (the father) in 1992, who paid for mediocre economic growth in 1990-1992.
(Had America's economy come out of recession six months earlier, Clinton would probably not have won in 1992.)
It took the Watergate scandal in 1974 and Nixon's resignation to make Gerald Ford (who became President upon Nixon's resignation) lose in 1976.
Eisenhower in 1956, Johnson in 1964, Reagan in 1984, Bush in 1990, and Clinton 1996 (all incumbent presidents or vice presidents) with an economy in good shape would have won even if they hadn't opened their mouth for the whole electoral campaign.
If this is so, given strong growth in America, Vice President Gore should win easily.
Instead Bush is holding his own.
Two factors work to Gore's disadvantage.
Many think that the benefits of the "new economy" have little to do with who was in office.
If this is really a "new" economy maybe the economy's impact on electoral results is also "new".
The second factor is that the Republicans who control Congress are relatively "extremist" and might lose the legislative elections.
American voter tend to prefer a system that balances the President and Congress.
The expected new power of Democrats in Congress puts Gore at a disadvantage.
Having said all this, if Gore loses on November 7 he will confirm that he is one of the least liked politicians of the 20th century.
Note, indeed, that this is no "Clinton effect": many polls indicate that Clinton would easily beat Bush.
In sum, an incumbent vice president who loses with an economy such as exists in America today should retire to private life.
If he wins by a hair's breath, he better work very hard to have any hope in 2004.
The Oil Shock that Never Was
The price of oil was supposed to skyrocket after September 11
This drop is due to three causes.
First, recession has hit certain high oil consumption sectors such as air transport hard and so demand for oil has gone down.
Second, American policy has (until now at least) avoided an open confrontation with the countries of the Persian Gulf; and Afghanistan, thank God, is not an oil producer.
Third, Russia, coming out of its post-Soviet crisis, seems decided to continue expanding of its own oil production, despite its recent sop to OPEC.
But this short-run fall in the price of oil should not let us lose sight of the long-term political problem; namely the fact that the major part of the present oil production is concentrated in countries governed by autocracies which use oil resources to maintain repressive patronage regimes, finance extravagant consumption by the elites, and acquire a terrifying amount of arms.
The existence of the enormous oil revenues and their unequal distribution are a continuous source of internal instability and external aggressiveness, as demonstrated by Iraq's recent history.
So is it our destiny that the scarcity of oil and its concentration in the Middle East remain a permanent source of global uncertainty?
Not necessarily.
In reality, there is now in a global abundance of oil and a great part of it can be found in one of the most stable countries on the planet: Canada.
In the last 20 years, the cost of Canadian oil extracted from non-conventional fossil deposits has dropped by more than half, and now stands at $11 a barrel.
In 1997 a study by the American government estimated that it is possible to produce more than 500 billion barrels of oil from non-conventional sources (``shell oil'' and ``tar sands'') at less than $30 per barrel.
The non-conditional reserves of oil are equal to about 250 times the conventional reserves and in theory could satisfy world energy needs (at today's levels) for the next 5000 years.
For now the non-conventional reserves are for the most part unexploited because they are uncompetitive on price with conventional oil and other sources of energy, such as natural gas.
Perhaps it will never become necessary to use these reserves of non-conventional fossil fuel, if the development of alternative technologies (for example, liquid hydrogen) should render oil obsolete.
But non-conventional oil reserves exist, and if one adds to it that the conventional reserves are sufficient to cover world consumption needs for the next few decades, it is clear that the problem of oil is not its scarcity.
The problem is that production nowadays is concentrated in an area that is politically and economically unstable.
Certainly, oil reserves are not infinite.
But there is no reason to think that they are becoming more ``scarce.''
If anything, technological innovation and new discoveries are reducing the importance of oil in the productive process.
The price of oil, corrected for inflation, in the last decade has not increased, and, despite all the ``oil shocks'' the world has seen, its price has, on average, oscillated around a price not much different from today's prevailing price.
Indeed, oscillations in the price of oil do not reflect ``structural'' scarcity in the long term, but are due to movements of demand and supply in the short and middle run.
In the short run, the demand for oil is ``inelastic,'' that is, it responds little to changes in price, and even small reductions in supply result in great price increases.
In the middle run, high prices lead to expansion of supply and reduced demand, and the price comes down again.
At that point producer countries - which depend on oil revenues to maintain consumption, political power, and patronage - try to raise prices by cutting production, and the cycle resumes.
This process increases political instability in producing countries and involves them in a vicious circle.
When the price of oil is high, their governments spend the money on arms and palaces fit for Pharoahs.
When the price of oil falls, they risk discontent, coups d'états , wars, and revolutions.
In sum, the oil market does not have a problem of ``scarcity,'' as much as one of ``volatility.''
As noted by former Saudi oil minister Sheik Yamani, sooner or later the age of oil will end, but not because of a lack of oil; much as the Stone Age did not end because of the lack of stones.
Ireland in the Dock
The Committee of European Finance Ministers has censured Ireland and the Irish budget, invoking for the first time in EU history the powers conferred by Article 99 of the Treaty.
That rebuke is being applied to perhaps Europe's most successful economy, for Ireland has the EU's second highest budget surplus, its second lowest level of public debt, and by far the highest growth in the 1990's of countries in the Monetary Union.
This step, and its motives, are without precedent.
Ireland's projected budget for 2001 foresees a slight reduction in public expenditures, from 31% to 30.8% of GDP, and a simultaneous reduction of taxes by about .6% of GDP.
As a consequence, Ireland's budget surplus will come down, according to forecasts, from 4.7 to 4.3% of GDP.
Few Europeans are losing sleep over Ireland's unprecedented good times.
Indeed, all the finance ministers who censured Ireland would like to face the same rosy economic data the Irish finance minister does.
Yet, according to the European Commission and those same finance ministers, Ireland's fiscal posture may generate strong inflationary pressures in an already overheated economy and so merits maximum punishment.
Censuring Ireland, however, is a dangerous mistake, both on the merits and from a methodological point of view.
When a country is growing at the speed of Ireland -- ie, a speed higher than Europe's average -- some inflation is not only inevitable but necessary.
By increasing the "rate of real exchange," inflation will help slow the Irish economy unless the growth of productivity is sufficient to maintain competitiveness.
Of course, Ireland's decision to cut taxes because of the huge surplus its robust economy has generated may have had electoral, rather than economic, motivations.
(Please, will the EU finance minister without a political agenda raise his hand?).
It is also possible that the inflationary effects of tax cuts may be slightly higher than the .3% estimated by the Irish government.
But the amount of uncertainty over the effects posed by Ireland's budget is enormous and the macroeconomic dimensions minuscule: the reduction in Ireland's budget surplus is only of .4% of GDP.
Besides, as even the EU Commission recognizes, Irish inflation is coming down, from 5.6% in the preceding year to 4.6% at the end of 2000.
Ireland has been tried and convicted on non-existent evidence.
Censuring Ireland is also a grave mistake from a methodological point of view; indeed, this is perhaps the gravest aspect of the case.
EU Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Pedro Solbes has often repeated in recent weeks that the Commission seeks to increase coordination of fiscal policies among Euro members.
But how is this to happen?
When?
For what end?
Coordination of fiscal policies indeed, can be counterproductive.
It can, for example, restore through a side window the fiscal laxness which the Treaty of Amsterdam evicted by the front door.
The Stability Pact already imposes limits on each member's fiscal policy discretion.
What else is there to coordinate?
Evidently, the Commission believes that it can judge, case by case, the best policy for every country, including policies that satisfy the Stability Pact.
To coordinate fiscal policy, however, you need to know the effects of proposed budgets.
Yet consensus does not even exist among professional economists about this.
For example, does reducing public expenditure have positive or negative effects on economic activity?
Unlike in the past, many economists now say that the effects are positive.
If true, the implications for coordinating fiscal policies would be diametrically opposed to those implicitly assumed by the Commission.
It is astonishing that the Commission thinks itself capable of calculating, to a second or third decimal point, the effects of this or that budgetary step in a certain country in Europe's economy.
The Commission, for example, is particularly opposed to the Irish policy of reducing indirect taxes rather than social contributions, because the latter are supposedly more inflationary.
But empirical evidence on this point is practically nonexistent; the econometric model of the Commission simply assumes that this is true, and that's that.
Coordination of economic policies is, in reality, a disguise for increasing the powers of the Commission and of the Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs.
These powers may allow large countries to impose their will on smaller ones.
Can you imagine anyone trying to censure Germany because it reduced its budget surplus by .4% of GDP?
There is also something surreal, even obscene, in Italy, with a public debt of 100% of GDP, a deficit of 1.5%, and asphyxiated growth, sitting in judgement on a country with a 4% budgetary surplus, a public debt of 39% of GDP, and annual growth over 10%!
Ireland is being used by the Commission to flex its muscles and issue a warning.
But the real if unspoken warning is this: something must be done to limit the ambitions of the Commission and of Commissioner Solbes and bring them back to reality.
The Delusion of Debt Forgiveness
ROME: Governments from around the world will gather in Brussels under UN auspices on May 14th to discuss the plight of poor countries.
As they talk, the leaders of rich countries may strike a self-satisfied pose, recalling as they do the old proverb, which says that forgiveness is divine.
For little more than a year ago they agreed to forgive much of the debt of the world's poorest countries.
Of course, forgiving the debts of the poor is undoubtedly noble.
Sadly, not everything that is noble is smart and effective.
Many of the debts of poor countries that have been forgiven were already considered as, de facto, lost and thus unrecoverable.
Interest and principal payments made by many poor countries were, as a result of this, much smaller than what was actually owed.
Ethiopia, for example, was paying a sum equal to 10% of its exports; payments of 70% would have been needed to cover the nominal value of its debt.
The Cologne Agreement on poor countries with the highest level of debt -- the Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative -- that was agreed to last year declared that debts will be forgiven up to the point at which interest payments become "sustainable": in other words, the agreement substitutes unrecoverable debt for a debt load that is nominally lower but "real."
According to calculations by Britain's Treasury, with the HIPC agreement Mozambique pays about the same proportion in debt service as it was paying before the accord was signed.
More than a shell game is at work here, however.
For the countries accorded debt forgiveness under the HIPC must renounce other forms of aid.
This restriction led Ghana to ask to opt out of the HIPC altogether.
Uncertainty about the numbers involved in the exercise in debt forgiveness is large, but reliable World Bank calculations show that, for the 9 countries in the most advanced stages of HIPC, interest expenditures should go down to 10% of the value of exports.
This amounts to a saving of about 1.4% of GDP -- the actual number will perhaps be larger by a few decimal points here and there when the effects of bilateral debt forgiveness are added.
A respectable outcome, but not an enormous amount.
Independent of these numbers, however, the debt forgiveness debate perpetuates the legend that the West is responsible for the oppressive debt burdens of poor countries, and, more generally, for the scarcity of assistance to help them fight poverty.
The reality is the opposite.
Few developing countries are seriously engaged in fighting poverty.
In many of them, public expenditure favor the middle and upper middle classes; above all, it favors city dwellers.
Economies in most poor countries, indeed, are rigged against their own poor in a variety of ways:
• by artificially inflated public employment: with high salaries being paid to state workers relative to the average wage, state jobs often provide lifetime employment for children of the middle classes;
• because pensions are available only for a few executives in the formal sector and for state employees, with nothing provided to the rural poor;
• because free university education is a form of redistribution from poor to rich because the poor are taxed to pay for university, but rarely get to go;
• because expenditures for primary education often end up being captured by teachers' unions in order to guarantee privileges for their members;
• through health expenditures that are often concentrated on hospitals in relatively prosperous and politically important urban areas;
• because free water and electricity are mostly a subsidy for the urban middle class and for rich farmers.
Overwhelming empirical evidence (provided in large part by the World Bank, a place keen on the idea of aid) proves that the development of the poorest countries is blocked, primarily, by government inefficiency and the corruption.
For development to take off, countries require moderately stable and efficient governments pursuing appropriate economic policies.
South Korea is the best example of what can be achieved in this way.
In 1960, it had a per capita income lower than Somalia; today it is a member of the OECD.
Empirical research amply demonstrates that development assistance is largely ineffective because it is given indiscriminately to governments who use it to enrich a tiny elite.
A recent document by a World Bank expert, William Easterly, shows that the same conclusion also holds for debt forgiveness initiatives.
Of course, the West is not blameless.
It erred in giving too much credit, not too little, to poor countries, and by handing out credit according to political needs rather than by rigorous criteria related to fighting poverty.
The ex-imperial powers favored their ex-colonies, regardless of whether they deserved assistance or how they used it.
During the Cold War, alliance loyalty rather than economic motivations, determined the flow of aid.
A corrupt but allied government was invariably preferred to an honest, non-allied one.
In addition, many of the bilateral credits now being canceled were in reality commercial credit guarantees which benefitted businesses in creditor countries more than poor countries.
In Italy, things were even worse: development assistance was largely disbursed in order to favor foreign friends of Italian politicians.
So debt forgiveness, even if morally commendable, risks sending two misleading messages: it tells the ruling classes of poor debtor countries that corruption pays; and it reinforces the Western public's belief that the problems of poor countries are caused by Western policies.
If these two points are not confronted, debt forgiveness will end up laying the foundations for a new cycle of indebtedness, corruption, and abiding poverty.
Checks and Balances in an EU Constitution.
EU Commission President Romano Prodi has proposed a scheme to strengthen the Union's executive.
Britain, France, and Spain are working on an opposing plan that will consolidate EU executive powers among the biggest EU states.
What's the ordinary European to think?
Europe's citizens scarcely grasp the issues at the heart of the European Constitutional Convention in Brussels.
Mountains of detail obscure problems; sterile, misleading national discussions that pit "Euroskeptics" against "Europhiles" muster sound and fury but clarify nothing.
So complicated do many issues seem that some newspapers and broadcasters have abandoned reporting about the Convention.
EU citizens can secure a clearer understanding of what the Convention should achieve by asking this question: how should governmental functions be divided between the EU and its member nations?
To answer this, we need to grasp government's true purpose.
Government should provide citizens with public goods: collective defense, legislation and regulation, enforcement of the rule of law.
These can be provided at different levels: local, regional, national, or supranational government, i.e., the EU.
But what is the right level?
In some areas, decentralization works because it recognizes diverse local or national communities.
However, local decisions often have repercussions on citizens in other communities.
So certain services should be allocated to a broader geographic unit because they have externalities (that is, interdependence of effects).
Europe's allocation of governmental powers should be based on the principle that institutions carry out only those activities with clear economies of scale and where differences of opinion are modest.
The lower a government activity's externalities, the more it should be localized.
Low externalities imply limited benefits to be gained from centralization; deep differences among citizens imply that the costs of harmonization would be too high.
The euro, for example, delivers clear advantages of scale by favoring international commerce and avoiding negative externalities.
No longer can the lira be devalued to favor Italian exports to the detriment of the French, followed by a French reaction, etc.
Although the imperfectly synchronized economic cycles of EU members causes friction over monetary and exchange rate policy, the euro's benefits outweigh the costs of diversity.
In educational policy, however, to impose the same system on all members would not create economies of scale.
Cultural differences are too strong to win voluntary compliance.
It would be absurd to delegate education and culture to a supranational level.
Of the areas of public policy with high economies of scale or externalities, two stand out: the common market and competition; and foreign policy and defense.
The former covers antitrust, trade, and the common currency.
Some think that fiscal policies - from the structure of taxation to welfare, to budget balances - should also be harmonized.
But national preferences are diverse, and if mechanically imposed, fiscal centralization might incite resistance.
Nor do centralized fiscal policies have any real raison d'être from a constitutional point of view.
The US Constitution, for example, does not prescribe balanced budgets for the states.
Only in exceptional circumstances is fiscal harmonization justified: prohibitions, say, on fiscal incentives aimed at limiting competition, impeding commerce, or restricting the movement of capital.
Foreign policy and defense belong, par excellence, at government's apex.
There are clear externalities and economies of scale.
It would be absurd if New York pursued a different foreign policy than Texas.
Much the same is true in Europe.
The addition of new EU members implies that more internal differences will occur, which means that fewer centralized policies are justified.
These considerations suggest a series of principles for the Convention to consider:
1.
The EU Constitution should establish unequivocally which prerogatives belong to Europe and which to member countries.
When in doubt, the principle of subsidiarity suggests that national states remain supreme;
2.
European-level institutions should guarantee the functioning of markets, including competition, commercial, and monetary policies;
3.
Fiscal policy should remain largely decentralized, save for a few exceptions;
4.
Foreign policy and defense are areas of federal competence, to be delegated to Europe at a proper time;
5.
The creation of new areas of federal competence should be accompanied by decision-making mechanisms found in genuinely representative democracies.
So "No centralization without representation."
Today's EU diverges enormously from these principles (see table), as is demonstrated by the fact that agriculture, which represents 2% of European GDP, accounts for 40% of EU expenditures. Activities of EU Institutions (percent of total) Source of Table: "What Does the European Union do?"
A. Alesina, I. Angeloni & L.Schuknecht, CEPR Discussion Paper no. 3115.
Europe faces an historic opportunity.
America's founding fathers wrote a Constitution that has lasted over 200 years.
Members of the European Convention obviously face a far more complex and diverse society-and thus a more daunting constitutional challenge.
But they can succeed by displaying comparable wisdom and foresight.
History's Crimes and Punishments
BUENOS AIRES: What price justice?
How countries deal with historical violations of human rights is the material of daily politics across Latin America, Eastern Europe, and Africa.
Look at Rwanda.
Look at Chile, where General Pinochet may at last face trial.
Look at Poland where President Kwasniewski and former President Walesa were almost banned from October's presidential election because of alleged ties to the communist era's secret police.
People everywhere are perplexed by the fact that horrific, systematic violations of human rights are treated differently in different countries.
Although differences undoubtedly exist, the ethical principles by which historical human rights violations should be treated in reconstructing democracy are the same.
Chile and Poland are not unique in confronting the burden of history.
Building democracy out of political cultures and civic habits riddled by state violence is no easy task.
The difficulties are multiplied when attempted in times of economic crisis.
I come from a country where violations of human rights were punished harshly.
Nonetheless, I understand the impulse to limit punishment in order that society heal and rebuild.
For punishment of systematic, historical human rights crimes as a matter of government policy is only morally justified if it is designed to protect society from greater evils in the future.
Human rights crimes, though fostered by states, are committed by individuals acting according to their own wills.
There are real social consequences in seeking punishment for such people.
It is not rational to impose such punishment when the consequences, far from preventing future crimes, may incite or cause greater or new social damage.
Punishment is ultimately an instrument -- not the only one, nor the most important -- for restoring a collective moral conscience to societies ravaged by dictatorship.
More important than punishment, I believe, is the revelation of truth by credible means, such as through an impartial judicial process.
Through such revelations what I call a "moral sentence" may be imposed on the guilty, and it is the existence of such a "sentence" which will arouse the type of deep public reflection necessary for the restoration of democracy.
No more secure guarantee for the protection of human rights exists than a heightened, collective moral awareness within society to defend every person's dignity.
National laws and international studies are valuable instruments to protect such rights insofar as they serve to promote such awareness, but they cannot replace it as the ultimate guarantee.
In democratic systems, this moral awareness can only be cultivated if the citizenry trusts the independence of its judges.
In the transition from dictatorship to democracy, members of the judiciary lack legitimacy.
So reestablishing social trust in the judiciary is one of the weightiest tasks democratically elected officials face during a transition.
In the appointment of independent judges, great care must be given to insure that the judiciary helps revitalize social trust in the capacity for transformation to democracy.
Based on my own experience as Argentina's first democratically elected president after the collapse of its military junta, I know that this is a long, complex, and painful process.
But if a social consensus arises that the judiciary is insufficient to guarantee or safeguard individual rights as well as the division of power between the legislative, executive, and judicial branches of government, that lack of trust could lead to social dismemberment.
Comprehending the process by which a society begins to fail to protect itself, by which it's moral compass deteriorates, is almost impossible.
Perhaps ethical absolutism and its opponent relativism influenced that deterioration by undermining the sense of collective truth that is forged in social dialogue and wide civic participation.
But a society's decision to waive punishment for human rights violators is not necessarily a sign that its moral awareness remains stunted.
Retribution is not the only sign of restored moral vigor.
A moral sense is essential to a democracy of true solidarity.
To secure the moral sense that only social solidarity may provide, a clear set of social rights must also exist.
A decent home and health care, education and an adequate income to develop and enrich personal lives, is sometimes considered as a particular goal for a group -- class, union, corporation -- without effect on other groups.
But the contrary is true.
Developing the economic and social aspects of the rights of man helps root all human rights as undeniable truth.
In short, democracy can only be built by men and women who are democratic in all their aspects.
This obvious truth is forgotten frequently.
Monarchy can exist with people who are anti-monarchists.
Fascism and Soviet communism were constructed on the backs off unwilling people.
Democracies built on unwilling foundations, however, cannot stand.
For democrats, loving freedom is not enough.
The great failure of our democratic conscience is in not recognizing this.
The habit of limiting universal human rights to a series of political and moral rights and consigning the economic aspects of humanity to a second, lower tier of our concern is dangerous.
It undermines the ethics of solidarity through which all human rights exist.
Democracy today must urgently address this insufficiency of solidarity.
If human rights are truly to be protected, the second, economic tier of human rights must be elevated to equality with the first tier in our consciences.
Only then will history's crimes receive the response they demand, which first and foremost is not punishment, but the certainty that such crimes will not reoccur.
Never again: for history's victims, that is our truest debt of honor.
The Revolt Of The States
BUENOS AIRES: Ceaseless change seems to be at the heart of today's global civilization.
Because of this, countries that consider their domestic realities as sacrosanct find themselves unable to assimilate change or foresee its direction.
To them, change appears as something irrational, even as a catastrophe.
As we saw in the anti-IMF protests in Prague recently, and last year's street protests against the World Trade Organization in Seattle, such fears are spreading far and wide.
People increasingly see change not as something that enhances their freedom and dignity but as a force encouraging avarice and unfairness.
By concentrating wealth narrowly, globalization produces more threats than opportunities.
The difficulty in transferring knowledge and new technologies from the center to the periphery, for example, widens economic disparity and subjugates some countries to a new form of colonialism.
Seeing this, many people fear a new dominant class intolerably manipulating globalization for its betterment.
By limiting prospects for growth for many people, today's international economic order is inconsistent with the ideals of the great democratic revolution of our century, which says that no inhabitant of the world should be left behind.
For those peoples and countries now marginalized from the process of technological development, production, and exchange I believe that only one viable option exists: a new assertion of themselves as independent states, regionally integrated in as many ways as possible.
Only with independence does the confidence for greater participation come, and greater participation means improved governance, both in the international order and domestically.
Ungovernablity arises from attempts to maintain control over people and places who are marginalized from participating in decisions that determine their daily lives.
Citizens and countries alike become "ungovernable" when they see themselves as passive instruments of decisions taken by a closed elite that rules by transforming them into a mute "mass".
For free individuals -- free citizens, free states -- are the real protagonists of governance.
Without full and equal responsibility there can be no lasting governance.
This is what market fundamentalists, management consultants, and technocrats fail to understand.
Countries, citizens, users, consumers, producers, workers, entrepreneurs, professionals cannot be left out of the decisions that hold significant consequences for their lives and goals, indeed for the very values of society.
People in the United States and Western Europe recognize how continuity in their democratic systems enhanced their prosperity.
By contrast, we in Latin America and Eastern Europe know that democracy has trouble surviving in times of crisis, poverty, and isolation.
Preserving democratic values is hard when large sectors cannot integrate with the global market, when misery obliterates human dignity and a lack of options makes freedom meaningless.
It is a bitter paradox, indeed, that the developed democracies use the power of globalization to punish us commercially by discriminating against our citizens and exports.
In individual states protection of the weak is attained by equal application of the rule of law.
This must also be made true in international relations.
But to create an international order based on law and not force -- economic force having replaced military might -- it is necessary to strengthen and spread multilateralism into political fields as well in economic ones.
Only the cooperation of free and equal nations can bring this about.
Related to this is the fact that nowadays economic development depends less on a particular country and more on regional integration, which can serve to avoid the negative effects of those financial speculations boosted by globalization.
So the world needs, in its regions, to facilitate integration on the basis of a general economic democratization: currency compatibility, free trade, shared legal rules and most of all a common will to fix the rules of the game according to a region's entire interests.
Only such equal cooperation can secure the solid political basis for integration.
So long as a country is subordinated to the uncontrollable force of globalization, its future is in foreign hands.
But in agreeing to open regional economies to imports, poor and developing countries must be allowed some means to protect their new industries.
There is justice in this, particularly given the hypocrisy of those countries who proclaim their faith in free trade while every day praying at the altar of protectionism.
Everyone acknowledges that the market requires rules in order to avoid deformations such as monopolies and oligopolies.
But monopolies of wealth are just as pernicious.
The State should not abandon its redistributive role; neither can the State surrender to the market its role in development.
Indeed, quality housing and schooling, pensions and unemployment insurance, a modern health system and family social services must not be the fruits of an established democracy but a condition for democracy's consolidation and survival.
For any program based on selfishness and injustice must generate strong forces of social dissolution and instability.
The great challenge is to increase equality, and for this the State, which globalization claims to have overthrown, is vital.
Only it can establish progressive taxes, adequate regulation of privatized public services, support to small and medium size companies, more efficiency in the public spending and a significant improvement in the education and health systems.
It is the State's undeniable obligation to guarantee the benefits of social security to all the inhabitants of a country.
Marxists used to agitate that the workers of the world unite.
They never did, but we are now seeing a globalization of solidarity, of support for cooperative regional patterns and the need to rethink international agencies, and the impracticality of isolation.
Without such solidarity, we are marching towards a world with no center, no authority, no order; a world ruled by a globalized Mafia "where what is official and what is clandestine will meet".
The logic of power in that future world will be unforgiving toward those who give up on their will to self-determination.
To maintain that will, we must fight the fear of going against the prevailing political orthodoxy of an inevitable globalization.
The only fish that always swims with the current is a dead fish.
Managing Iraq's Oil
In recent months, Iraq's oil production has grown to more than two million barrels per day.
At this rate, current oil output and oil exports now exceed post-invasion predictions.
Experts had argued that funding shortages, lack of security, the problems of stabilizing a legitimate government, and technology shortfalls would severely limit Iraq's output.
Despite the odds, Iraq's daily output reached a post-invasion record of 2.5 million barrels in March.
A number of factors enabled Iraq to increase its output.
Most significantly, the Bush administration gave Iraq $2.3 billion to restore its oil production.
After the invasion, no one expected Iraq to get loans, let alone outright grants.
Instead, $2.3 billion was invested directly into the Iraqi oil sector.
To protect the oil fields and other facilities, the Americans dedicated a massive, overwhelming force of soldiers and private contractors.
The level of protection was unprecedented even compared to Saddam's regime.
On the technical side, the Bush administration hired the world's best oil service companies to revamp Iraq's technologically challenged oil fields.
They still have a long way to go, but significant improvements are already evident.
Moreover, the war didn't change the quality of Iraqi fields, which are still among the richest in the world and can produce oil with relatively little effort and investment.
Finally, high oil prices in the past 12 months provided an unexpectedly large windfall to the Iraqi budget, allowing for the financing of other sectors without slighting the oil industry.
High prices also enabled the Coalition Provisional Authority to add even more private security personnel to protect refineries and pipelines.
Granting Iraq the money to restore its oil industry was one of the best post-war decisions that the Bush administration has made.
The money allowed Iraq to begin to address security, production, and technology issues throughout its oil system.
But the question remains: will output growth continue following the transfer of sovereignty to an Iraqi government at the end of June?
Despite massive injections of funds and unprecedented security, insurgents have still managed to halt or reduce oil production and exports several times since the invasion.
The bombing of a pipeline or other oil facility somewhere in Iraq remains almost a daily occurrence, and the transfer of power has not reduced these attacks so far.
Like the Bush administration and Saddam himself, the insurgents understand that whoever controls Iraqi oil controls Iraq's destiny.
The new Iraqi government, even supported by US military might, will simply not be able to guarantee a predictable flow of oil, and output will remain quite volatile.
At the same time, maintaining the flow of funds into the Iraqi oil sector is essential, not only for its growth, but for its very survival.
Money brings technological regeneration as well as security.
Under even the best circumstances for Iraq, with oil prices remaining high, the funds available to maintain and modernize the oil industry are limited.
If oil prices decline in the future, the oil industry will suffer severely.
This makes for an interesting relationship between Iraq and Saudi Arabia.
Only Saudi Arabia can manage the global output of oil in such a way that will make room for Iraqi oil and keep prices high.
In contrast, only Saudi Arabia can flood the market and reduce prices far below their current level.
A decline in oil revenues could be devastating to the fledgling Iraqi government.
Current oil revenues are barely enough to cover state expenses, let alone pay for reconstruction, debt, and war reparations.
Even if President Bush wins reelection, it is highly unlikely that the US will make another outright grant to a sovereign Iraq.
Theoretically, international loans could be an alternative, but who would lend to an unstable government, let alone a government whose legitimacy has not been fully established?
Likewise, privatization is out of the picture for now.
The new government will have to make do and chart a slow path for its oil recovery, just as Saddam's regime did.
At the same time, the logic of renewed American support for the Iraqi oil industry remains powerful.
Normal financing is not forthcoming.
Only grants from the US will reduce output volatility.
Saddam's regime caused most of the volatility in the oil market in the last 30 years.
In fact, every peak in oil prices since 1973 was caused by an event related to Iraq.
One would hope that his removal would reduce market volatility and stabilize oil prices.
Unfortunately, Iraq appears set to continue to be a major source of high oil prices, owing to highly erratic output.
For the foreseeable future, one of the principal outcomes of the invasion of Iraq will be greater volatility and thus higher prices.
The Perilous Fantasy of Energy Independence
increases energy insecurity.
However much politicians who call for energy independence might prefer it otherwise, the market has chosen oil as a staple energy source.
So governments should ignore neither the valid interests of oil exporters, on whom consumers in their countries depend, nor exporters' reaction to the rhetoric of energy independence or to steps taken to achieve it.
Isolationist politicians may not care about other countries, but they should think twice lest they harm their own.
The biggest threats to the world's energy security are not terrorist attacks or embargoes by oil-producing countries -- short-term events that can be dealt with quickly and effectively through various measures, including reliance on strategic petroleum reserves, increases in production, and diversion of oil shipments.
Instead, the main threat to the long-term sustainability of energy supplies is the mismatch between investment in additional capacity and energy infrastructure, on one hand, and growth in demand for energy on the other.
Major oil exporters could respond in a variety of ways to political posturing on energy, most of which would exacerbate rather than ameliorate the global energy situation.
One of the most plausible scenarios in response to calls by governments and politicians around the world to reduce or even eliminate dependence on oil is a relative decline in investment in additional production capacity in the oil-producing countries.
An energy crisis in this case is almost certain if those who press for energy independence fail to provide a workable alternative in a timely manner.
Of course, these efforts will almost surely fail to replace oil within a reasonable time, as they are not market-driven and require heavy subsidies.
Indeed, confronted by political leaders' hostile rhetoric, oil producers have a strong incentive to increase production in order to lower oil prices to levels that undermine the economic feasibility of alternative energy sources -- a logical interventionist policy to counter the anti-oil interventionist policies of consuming countries.
After all, a collapse in oil prices would be a death sentence for several new energy technologies, and, not incidentally, would increase demand for oil.
Even if the oil producing countries do not intentionally bring about an oil price collapse, they might accelerate production as much as they could in the short term, while oil still had some value.
But lower oil prices, coupled with expectations of a decline in demand, would in turn put pressure on oil-producing countries to reduce planned investments in production capacity or even to mothball major projects, as they have done in the past, leading to a decline in oil supplies.
Thus, if alternative energy technologies did not come on-line by the time oil production started to fall, global shortages would become inevitable, while closing the investment deficit would take years, even in the face of rising oil prices.
In spite of these possibilities, let's assume that plans for energy independence succeed, and that several European countries, the United States, Japan, China, and India become self-sufficient.
Major oil exporters could then seek to use their now less-valuable oil at home as cheap fuel for an expanded heavy industrial sector.
Instead of exporting oil directly, they could export their energy embedded in metals, chemicals, and manufactured products at prices that undercut anything producers in the oil-consuming countries, especially Europe and the US, could match, given their dependence on higher-cost alternative energy sources.
Energy independence thus could destroy entire industries, especially petrochemicals, aluminum, and steel.
In fact, cheap energy in oil-producing countries might make their new industries competitive with those in China, India, and Southeast Asia.
The net result would be a loss of jobs and weakened economies.
Countries might end up energy-independent, only to become steel-dependent or petrochemical-dependent.
So what would come next?
Would politicians, with their perpetual fascination with "independence," attempt to eliminate dependence one commodity at a time?
Put another way, would the cause of "energy independence" seek to reverse globalization?
Oil is a finite resource.
Only long-term, market-oriented, economically viable, and sustainable energy options can ensure economic growth in both producing and consuming countries.
Isolationist policies, by contrast, always lead to shortages and discontent.
No matter how energy independence is pursued, it will never amount to anything other than an unattainable -- and potentially dangerous -- fantasy.
The Endless Iranian Nuclear Crisis
Iran, it is often claimed, has no need for nuclear power, given its abundant oil and natural gas reserves.
But the Iranian government is under economic and political pressure to supply increasing amounts of electricity to its growing population and fragile economy.
Using oil or natural gas for domestic electricity threatens oil and gas exports, which are the principle source of government revenues.
Indeed, with domestic oil consumption growing at a higher rate than production, government revenues from oil exports are already in decline.
Thus, nuclear power will halt the decline in government revenues by freeing more oil and natural gas for export.
Iran's natural gas resources, if developed, would not be a substitute for cheap nuclear power, because gas is more profitable in other uses than in power generation.
The Iranian government fears that electricity shortages, slow economic growth, and high unemployment will turn the populace against it.
As social tensions increase, political turmoil will follow.
Nuclear power offers the possibility of cheap, plentiful electricity, which will contribute to social and political stability.
Iranian experts argue that, in considering the trade-off between internal unrest and external sanctions, the Iranian government must choose between domestic security and international security.
Domestic pressure could very well bring down the regime, but international pressure will not.
History is on the side of the Iranian government.
The Islamic Revolution has survived a brutal war with Iraq, economic sanctions, and decades of international pressure and isolation from the US.
Moreover, Iran's leaders remember that the Shah was forced to flee the country in 1979, despite having strong international support.
While there may be security reasons for any future US administration to oppose even a civilian nuclear program, American policymakers also recognize the strategic impact that nuclear energy will have in stabilizing the Iranian regime.
The US and Iran have been fighting proxy wars since 1979, and their ongoing conflict means that proxy wars will continue in Lebanon, Iraq, Afghanistan, and the Caspian Sea region, as will trade and investment wars.
Indeed, as long as China and Russia have money to invest and arms to sell, most UN sanctions will be toothless.
Iran will continue to threaten the world community that it will use its oil weapon, but this is highly unlikely.
It is not in Iran's interest, under any scenario, to decrease oil exports, let alone halt them.
However, domestic pressure, a sense of nationalism, and the need to improve its bargaining position with Western countries might force the Iranian government to respond to harsh UN sanctions or an air attack on its nuclear facilities.
But even under these extreme circumstances, Iran will still need its oil revenue.
A symbolic cut or embargo, while possible, would have little impact on world oil markets.
Iran's government has more effective options to respond to attacks from the US and its allies.
Its supporters in Iraq might cripple Iraqi oil exports from Basra, which would damage US plans in Iraq while boosting Iran's oil revenues, or limit the availability of fuel to the US Army by attacking roads and bridges, especially the Kuwait City-Baghdad highway.
The world community will continue to pay a high price for the nuclear standoff, which will cast a shadow over world oil markets for years to come.
Some experts argue that it has already raised oil prices by about $15 per barrel.
Ironically, an Iranian civilian nuclear program would enhance US and world energy security by making more oil and gas available in the global market.
But America's determination to destabilize Iran and the Iranian government's determination to retain power reduce the likelihood of this scenario.
How Does the Weak Dollar Affect Oil Prices?
The implications of pricing oil in any single-currency are more far-reaching than most people think.
For example, some oil-producing countries ask their customers to pay in euros, but that does not mean that their oil is priced in euros.
And even if dollar prices were to be replaced by euro prices, the impact of single-currency pricing on the oil market would be the same.   
While oil-exporting countries receive revenues in dollars (or their euro equivalent), they use different currencies to import goods and services from various countries.
Any change in the exchange rate of the dollar affects the purchasing power of these countries, and therefore their real income. 
Likewise, international oil companies sell most of their oil in dollars, but they operate in various countries and pay some of their costs in local currencies.
Any change in the value of the dollar therefore affects their cost structure and profitability.
In turn, it affects reinvestment in exploration, development, and maintenance.
The relationship between the value of the dollar and oil prices is very complex.
While they can feed on each other to produce a vicious cycle, their short-term relationship is distinct from their long-term relationship.
In the short-term, dollar depreciation does not affect supply and demand, but it does affect speculation and investment in oil futures markets.
As the dollar declines, commodities -- including oil -- attract investors.
Investing in futures becomes both a hedge against a weakening dollar and an investment vehicle that could yield substantial profit, particularly in a climate of vanishing excess oil production capacity, increasing demand, declining interest rates, a slumping real estate market, and crisis in the banking industry.
OPEC might be correct to blame American policies and speculators for higher prices.
It is also correct that if OPEC had excess capacity, it would have already used it to flush out speculators to bring oil prices down.
OPEC can regain control in one of two ways: use its "claimed" excess capacity to flush out speculators, or use its financial surpluses to overtake them.
Recourse to the latter option means that, even without excess capacity, OPEC can still be in the driver's seat.
In the long run, however, statistical analysis of various oil industry variables indicates that a weaker dollar affects supply by reducing production, regardless of whether oil is owned and produced by national or international oil companies.
A weak dollar also affects demand by increasing consumption.
The result of a decrease in supply and an increase in demand is higher prices.
The lower dollar also reduces the purchasing power of oil exporters.
If nominal oil prices remain constant while the dollar declines, the real income of the oil-producing countries declines, resulting in less investment in additional capacity and maintenance.
The same is true of oil companies.
Consequently, oil prices increase.
Indeed, because oil prices were rising while the dollar was declining, capacity expansion by oil firms failed to meet forecasts for non-OPEC production in the last three years.
Even oil production in the United States has not matched the increase in oil prices, as rising import costs for tools and equipment -- partly a reflection of the dollar's weakness and other factors -- have forced project delays and cancellations.
Of course, the lower dollar means cheaper oil in Europe, Asia, and all countries with appreciating currencies.
Oil prices hit records in the US in 2004 and 2005, but not in Europe, which partly explains why economic growth there has not been affected.
When Americans paid $120 per barrel, Europeans paid only about €76 per barrel.
Several factors have prevented high oil prices from affecting the demand for petroleum products in the US in recent years, such as increased government spending, low interest rates, tax breaks, and an increase in real incomes.
To be sure, the weaker dollar has forced some American families to spend their vacations in the US instead of Europe.
But, since many Americans use gas-guzzling SUV's for their vacations, demand for gasoline has remained high.
Unless and until US consumption patterns change or a rebounding dollar increases oil production, Americans will bear the brunt of single-currency oil pricing.  
Losing Turkey
Both the dominant Justice and Development Party (AKP) and its secular rivals remain publicly committed to pursuing EU membership, but in practice doubts have emerged.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy's insistence that a referendum should be held on Turkey's admission suggests that years of painful adjustment to EU norms will never produce the payoff of membership.
The US and the EU are evidently convinced that Turkey has nowhere else to go.
The Turks, they think, will fatalistically accept any snub.
But this cozy assumption overlooks a tectonic shift in Turkey's geo-political position.
Immediately after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Turkey looked to the newly-independent central Asian states in a mood of pan-Turkic romanticism.
These ancestral homelands exercised a hold on Turkish imaginations, but today it is business opportunities, energy resources, and other practical matters rather than ethnic unity that are creating a loose Turkic "commonwealth."
Most striking is Turkey's renewal of relations with Russia without damaging its ties to the newly independent post-Soviet states.
Turkey's ancient antagonism toward Russia briefly revived when the Soviet Union imploded.
In the early 1990's, some Turkish generals saw the humiliation of Russian troops in Chechnya as part of a long-awaited revenge.
But, while Russia (and Iran) were once Turkey's great geo-political rivals, today they are export markets and energy suppliers.
Energy is the key to Turkey's new geo-political position.
Its industry and population are growing dynamically, so its energy demands are producing geo-political synergy with Russia and Iran, neither of which can afford to cut the flow of oil and gas without provoking a massive internal crisis.
Meanwhile, as Turkey's attitude toward its neighbors has changed, its governing elite has watched the EU embrace ex-communist countries with far shakier market economies and shorter democratic records.
As one Turkish general put it, "If we had joined the Warsaw Pact rather than NATO, we would be in the EU by now."
Last summer's re-election of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's AKP, followed by the election of Abdullah Gul as the first president whose wife wears a headscarf, seemed to confirm the fears of anti-Islamic Europeans.
Yet, even if many AKP activists and voters are devout Muslims, Erdogan and Gul remain committed to European integration.
Time is running out, however, for them to satisfy their supporters and silence their critics by achieving it.
The problem is that the AKP's victories, together with America's courting of Erdogan and Gul, have triggered a crisis of direction among Turkey's once-dominant secular and pro-western elite.
Even if the AKP can rely on the allegiance of millions of voters and swarms of new members anxious to join the winning side, the secularists are deeply entrenched in Turkey's institutions, universities, media, and business.
But both ordinary AKP supporters and disillusioned secularists are now suspicious of America's actions and motives in the region.
Key military figures' tacit backing for the Turkish Parliament's refusal to endorse the March 2003 US-led invasion of Iraq suggests that Turkish nationalism could unite the AKP's rank-and-file MPs with their otherwise implacable foes in the secular camp.
If the EU were to snub Turkey openly over membership, or if America were to seem too lax on the Kurdish problem in Northern Iraq, a huge swathe of the two camps could well unite.
Turkey's links with Israel, for example, have been strained by Israeli investment in Kurdistan.
While Shimon Peres made a gesture of reconciliation by choosing Ankara as the setting for the first speech by an Israeli president to the parliament of a predominantly Muslim country, Israel's concerns about Iran are far more serious than are Turkey's.
Israel's two most irreconcilable enemies, Iran and Syria, are in fact among the most vocal supporters of Turkey's hard-line stance towards the Kurds.
America's conquest of Iraq de-stabilized Turkey's Western orientation more than the US cares to admit.
Most Turks don't want to see their country excluded from the West, but if the EU spurns them while speeding up entry for weaker candidates, Turkey may come to feel sufficiently strong and embittered to strike out on a new geo-political course.
The Euro Ark
Faced with the biggest test in its history, the euro is far from steering into disaster, as the Nobel laureate economist Milton Friedman predicted ten years ago.
On the contrary, Europe's Economic and Monetary Union is proving a major asset in these tumultuous times.
Doubters should remember that the euro was itself born out of crisis.
The single currency was conceived as an answer to the upheavals of the postwar period -- double-digit inflation, high unemployment, and speculative attacks on the pound, the lira, and the French franc.
It was the crisis of the European Monetary System that drove the euro's launch on January 1, 1999.
In ten short years, the euro revolutionized the global economic environment, rising to the status of the world's second currency and rivaling the dollar as a medium for international trade and finance.
The EMU is now the world's largest market, and continues to grow.
With Slovakia's entry on January 1, the euro spans 16 countries and 329 million citizens.
The benefits of a monetary union based on a stable macroeconomic framework and governed by an independent central bank are manifest: the euro area has enjoyed low inflation and low interest rates for much of the last decade, a boost in trade and investment, and rapid integration of financial markets.
Moreover, 16 million jobs have been created over the last 10 years -- a record more successful than even the US.
Today's financial turmoil and economic downturn are highlighting the EMU's advantages in several important ways.
First, the euro has eliminated the possibility of exchange-rate turbulence and speculative currency attacks that more vulnerable economies could have expected in the current turmoil.
As a stable and strong world currency, the euro is also limiting exchange-rate instability globally.
Second, the euro area benefits from an independent European Central Bank whose swift actions to ease liquidity constraints and coordinate monetary policy have recently helped to avert a financial meltdown.
Such rapid, coordinated steps by 16 national central banks would have been unthinkable.
Third, the EMU's stability-oriented macroeconomic framework has better prepared euro-area countries for economic storms.
Thanks to the fiscal rules of the Stability and Growth Pact, the euro area achieved its soundest budgetary position in 2007, bringing deficits to their lowest levels in 25 years.
This allowed many European Union countries to approach the crisis with room for maneuver.
Such are the EMU's benefits that the visible costs of remaining a non-member are beginning to recast the political debate surrounding euro adoption in several countries. 
Of course, the euro is no panacea, nor has it functioned perfectly over the last decade.
Divergences between euro-area economies in terms of growth and inflation have been a persistent challenge.
Though differences are no bigger than those found within larger economies such as the US or Germany, they risk being amplified by the crisis.
This is why it is even more important that we continue to improve the EMU's functioning.
This requires not just reinforcing resilience in the face of crisis, but also equipping euro-area economies for the longer-term challenges of globalization, aging, resource scarcity, and climate change.
In a potentially more volatile twenty-first century global economy, we must reap the maximum benefits of economic integration in terms of growth and jobs.
The key to a better functioning EMU is closer surveillance and deeper coordination of economic policies.
Leaders must start living up to the responsibilities that come with sharing a single currency.
They must recognize the impact that national economic policies have on the euro area as a whole, and thus discuss and coordinate economic programs at the euro-area level.
Here, the launch of the European Economic Recovery Plan -- the initiative for an EU-wide fiscal stimulus equivalent to 1.5% of GDP, endorsed by the European Heads of Government in December -- constitutes a major step forward.
This must now be followed by closer budgetary monitoring, particularly given that fiscal stimulus measures, the economic downturn, and bank rescue plans will take a toll on public finances.
The Stability and Growth Pact must remain the cornerstone of the EU's budgetary framework, and effective surveillance and peer support will be vital to help member states work towards balanced budgets once the economy rebounds.
Deeper fiscal surveillance should be matched by broader economic surveillance, especially since current-account imbalances have become more acute during the crisis.
The European Commission is now working on extending the focus of surveillance beyond fiscal policy so that we can identify risks stemming from macroeconomic imbalances or changes in competitiveness and address them before they become entrenched.
Finally, euro-area nations must strive harder to find common positions on international issues and to speak with a single voice in the global arena.
This is the only way to promote and defend the EMU's economic interests in a world where the challenges are global and overcoming them will increasingly depend on multilateral cooperation.
Consider November's international summit on the financial crisis.
Agreeing a common position ahead of the meeting gave Europe a greater role.
When the euro area manages to agree swiftly on a coordinated position, this can be instrumental to finding agreement in the EU as a whole and internationally.
It is vital we now build on this success and develop a genuine international strategy for the euro.
The European single currency has been a major success, but it remains a work in progress.
A decade after the euro's introduction, we must follow the example of its founders and turn crisis into opportunity by uniting in a spirit of cooperation and ambition -- and thereby reinforce the EMU's foundations.
In 1995, men retired, on average, at 61 and women at 58.
During the same period, life expectancy grew by 11 years.
Despite longer retirements living standards among those on pensions improved enormously.
Is it likely that an equal increase in living standards could occur between now and 2040 (when there will be two working people -- as opposed to four today -- for each person in retirement)?
No, because social solidarity is not what it was.
After WWII, pensions were very low and the costs they imposed on workers were modest.
Because economies were growing, workers voluntarily accepted continuous increases in the taxes paid to finance the pension system.
Today, in all EU countries, the average income provided by pensions is much higher and, in some cases, such as in France, higher than many incomes received by the working population.
Rising pension pay-outs, when combined with continuous increases in taxes and social security contributions, have made those with jobs unwilling to contribute more to the retired.
This resistance has brought forward the issue of allowing capital markets to play a role in financing Europe's pension systems.
In years to come, the development of a system of supplementary capitalized pensions in Europe is inevitable because private retirement savings can provide individuals with a defense against declining levels within mandatory pension schemes.
The rising popularity of personal retirement savings may also help enhance the efficiency of Europe's financial markets, the lack of which is partly responsible for Europe's slower growth and higher unemployment.
Nevertheless in order to avoid private pensions threatening mandatory pensions and thus erode social solidarity, three conditions need to be present:
• avoid ideological prejudgments.
Retirement savings should be encouraged, not this or that particular investment vehicle.
Apart from pension funds, there are also life insurance products and salary-reduction savings;
• the costs of reforms that provide the most support for the most modest types of savings should be divided among all citizens;
• workers must participate in establishing a pension system to complement state pensions.
A proposed European Commission directive about professional pensions is now on the table.
In attempting to harmonize among EU members the prudential rules governing institutions involved managing retirement savings, this proposal has many favorable aspects, particularly if it facilitates cross-border mobility among workers (i.e., the ability of a worker to carry a pension program with him when changing jobs, even if he or she takes a job in a different country).
Europe and President Bush
ROME: What does the future hold for transatlantic relations?
That question arises with every new American administration.
Because worries about a "widening Atlantic" gap have existed since the early 1970s, it is tempting to proceed as if transatlantic relations will remain on roughly the same wavelength as before.
The truth is, however, that the US and the EU are rapidly evolving along their own paths: both sides of the Atlantic thus face the challenge of managing an ever more complex relationship.
Two other temptations must also be resisted.
On the European side is the temptation to speed the emergence of the Union as an international actor by constantly claiming autonomy or independence from the US.
Lingering anti-American undertones, of course, will invariably surface for, as in any long unbalanced relationship, the junior partner will tend to make declaratory statements that generate misperceptions.
Europeans should not succumb to this temptation, for the move from dependency to equal partnership is not measured by rhetoric.
Instead, Europeans must assume a fairer share of the transatlantic burden, putting in place a truly common European foreign policy, and think and act as a regional power with a global outreach.
If the Euro succeeds as a global currency, which I believe it will, and if Europe's rapid reaction force becomes a reality soon, as I also think it will, the EU will have secured the preconditions for a more equal partnership -- literally by putting its money (and soldiers) where its mouth is.
On the American side, the temptation is to overplay its "sole superpower" role by acting unilaterally.
But this is loneliness disguised as leadership and is not in America's interest.
National interests can no longer be effectively pursued unilaterally; US global interests are served best by multilateral action and bodies.
Even if, in military terms, America remains the sole superpower, military might is of limited use in the daily conduct of foreign policy.
America would benefit not less than Europe from an effective system of global governance in the achievement of its goals -- be it freer trade, a viable non-proliferation regime, containment and prevention of regional conflicts, or better regulated financial markets.
To this end, the US has a vital stake in the EU's coming of age as an international actor.
It should therefore do away with the traditional ambivalence of demanding a more mature and active Europe on one hand, all the time feeling uncomfortable with it on the other.
True, America officially welcomed the launching of a common European security and defense policy.
But recurring signs of US nervousness about the nature of this process exist.
Americans often ask whether it is all about better European capabilities -- which would be fine for NATO -- or about European integration (i.e. instrumental to a political project).
My response is that it is about both, and that Washington should support both.
A sober assessment of this process leads me to assert that a more capable and united Europe will usher in a more effective Atlantic Alliance and not, as some believe, in American disengagement from European commitments.
What the EU aims at is not a duplication of NATO structures or an alternative to the Atlantic Alliance.
The EU is preparing to deal -- jointly with US forces or with purely European forces when NATO as a whole decides not to engage -- with crises in and around Europe.
More than defense -- which will remain NATO-centered -- Europe is building up its security role as a regional stabilizer: a role that EU enlargement to include candidate countries in Central and Eastern Europe will strengthen.
For, contrary to what is often said in America's Congress, Europe already bears the lion's share of the peacekeeping burden (let alone reconstruction aid) in the Balkans.
It goes without saying that there should be "no taxation without representation."
If Europe's foreign and defense policies succeed, NATO should become more European.
Washington, however, should not worry about this: if Europeans see the Alliance as a more European organization they are more likely to commit themselves (in budgetary terms, too) to its success.
A similar logic of partnership applies to enlargement.
The concept of Europe is not immutable, and rightly so.
On the basis of a broad notion of security and stability, EU enlargement is every bit as important as deepening the EU.
Here a common transatlantic approach to both EU and NATO enlargement would enhance stabilization and integration in post-Cold War Europe -- to everyone's benefit.
A new and functional division of labor between Europeans and Americans is thus conceivable, provided it retains the framework of common political commitments and shared responsibilities.
What should not be pursued is a rigid, vertical and artificial division of labor, whereby the US plays the lone global leader (with Europe simply following) while the EU concentrates exclusively on enlarging its "house" (with the US disengaging from Continental security).
This would be unhealthy and make the transatlantic compound unsustainable.
The antidote is a genuine sharing of choices and decisions.
If divisive decisions must be taken, healthy partnership requires that they be discussed openly and honestly.
A case in point is the issue of National Missile Defense.
No matter what policy the Bush administration adopts, European reservations and doubts should be taken into account.
If Europeans want to have some influence here, they must play a unitary role by, say, encouraging America to update the ABM Treaty in agreement with Moscow.
That would help strategic stability, prevent antagonizing Russia (which remains a fundamental factor in European security) and avoid deteriorating the security climate in Asia.
The same is true of dealing with so-called "rogue States": here again, a better combination of US and European strategies could produce a more effective approach, based on a blend of engagement and resolve.
A new division of labor, and a new sharing of responsibilities, depends as much on economics as on security.
A stable Euro makes stronger cooperation possible and desirable: not only to prevent global financial instability but to avoid the risk of conflicting currency blocs arising.
Provided that the Bush Administration pragmatically pushes for more trade liberalization, we will be able to deepen transatlantic market integration, which will act as a boost for our economies.
Scope will also then exist for revitalizing the WTO, for which a strong European-American commitment is a necessary precondition, though not the entire solution.
Here a serious reassessment of our negotiating tactics and old habits is needed.
The WTO, but also the IMF and World Bank, must understand the evolving needs of those societies most vulnerable to the impact of globalization.
We need to reach out to the rest of the world in a more open and persuasive way.
The G-8 process, which Italy chairs this year, will test such resolve - on which rests the legitimacy of the entire process.
A renewed Euro-American partnership based on our own respective styles and instruments in foreign policy will benefit both sides.
The EU is rightly searching for its identity as a collective actor.
As Europe changes, so too does America -- in terms of its demographic and social composition, economic and political structures, geopolitical orientation and national psychology.
Granted, transatlantic diversity might cause occasional squabbles.
However, mutual interaction and equal partnership remain the only response -- especially if they are reflected into long overdue reforms of multilateral institutions and increased global governance.
Operating within multilateral frameworks, however tiresome, has more often than not served US national interests as well as those of Europe.
This will not change. A stronger EU is America's natural partner, occasional competitor, but certainly not a rival.
It is the duty of governments on both sides of the Atlantic to persuade their publics of this.
Europe by Degrees
To be sure, impatient dissatisfaction has been a driving force behind European integration since its initial years.
But, as Robert Schuman wrote in his Declaration in 1950, Europe could not be built all at once.
Likewise, Altiero Spinelli, another of the EU's founding fathers, wrote late in life that without visionary Europeans there would be no Europe, but without pragmatic statesmen, the visionaries would have gotten nowhere.
The Reform Treaty's shortcomings are obvious.
Abandoning the name "Constitution" was probably necessary to bring all member states on board.
But not equally necessary is the enduring uncertainty about the common political platform upon which Europe's voice in foreign policy will have to rely.
Moreover, the Area of Freedom, Security, and Justice still requires unanimity for essential decisions in the fight against crime and terrorism and therefore, implying excruciating slowness.
Nor does the Treaty do enough to strengthen coordination of Europe's economic and budgetary policies.
Moreover, agencies such as Europol and Eurojust will be similarly subject to greater parliamentary scrutiny, and the budgetary procedure will be simpler and more democratic.
The EU Charter of Fundamental Rights will become legally binding and the judicial protection of citizens will be enhanced by facilitating their access to the European Court of Justice and by extending the Court's jurisdiction.
The Union's capacity as a global actor will be enhanced by merging the High Representative with the Commissioner for External Relations and establishing a single diplomatic service.
Europe's Constitutional Future
Last week, the President of the European Convention, Valery Giscard d'Estaing, submitted a so-called "skeleton" for a future Constitution of Europe.
All the ingredients of a constitution - values, principles, the rights of citizens, the competencies of the Union and its constituent institutions, etc - were included.
This document arose despite the fact that the Convention's mandate did not empower the delegates to produce a constitution.
According to the Nice Declaration, which I drafted as one of the participating prime ministers, we were only to simplify and restructure the EU's basic treaties.
As the C onvention worked, our mandate was transformed due to various pressures.
These came from member countries, from civil society organizations, and from letters, documents, and email messages from across Europe.
Democratic pressure changed our mandate.
When even the Foreign Minister of Britain, a country happy with its centuries-old "unwritten constitution," claims himself eager to have a written European Constitution, something truly has changed!
Yet, scholars such as Ralph Dahrendorf and Joseph Weiler suggest that a European constitution does not make sense because a democratic constitution presupposes a paramount common identity that is absent in an EU where individual national loyalties still prevail.
Others, such as Robert Dahl, argue that democracy requires smaller communities based on shared interests and personal relations.
For them, Europe may be too big to forge truly democratic institutions.
Such theoretical objections must be set against the fact Europe already exists - indeed, decisions are made everyday on the European level which determine our lives.
We may dislike it, but the EU is part of our system of government, like municipalities, regions, and nation-states.
So the question is not whether Europe exists, but whether we are satisfied with the way it functions.
If not, can we fix it, and is a constitution the way to do it?
The first problem in need of a "constitutional" solution that is tackled is Europe's clear and unified identity.
Not many people realize it, but because of the patchwork of treaties from which today's European institutions arose, "Europe" is not a unitary entity; indeed, the "European Union" and the "European Community" denote two different things.
The Community is the set of institutions created in the 1950's to establish a common market.
When we decided later to have a common foreign policy, and to cooperate in judicial and police matters, we invented the Union.
The Union deals with foreign policy; the Community with economic integration.
One consequence of this is that agreements with third countries that involve both foreign and economic matters require two distinct treaties: one for the Union, one for the Community.
This confuses even trained foreign diplomats who negotiate with Europe.
If it confuses them, how befuddling must it be for ordinary citizens?
How can a European citizen really identify with Europe if no single "Europe" exists?
Europe's indistinct legal identity has another deleterious impact.
If the Community does something that affects someone's rights, he or she can go to court.
But if the Union encroaches on your rights, access to a court may be closed because the Union happens to have no legal personality!
The next problem to be tackled - again with constitutional implications - is the anonymous, bureaucratic nature of European legal acts.
Criticizing institutions is as essential a part of democracy as protecting enumerated legal rights.
But Europe's institutions are hard to criticize because they produce acts that ordinary people cannot name or understand.
In national life, acts of parliaments are called "statutes" or "laws," and these usually have names that you can rally for and against.
In the EU we have " regulations," "directives," "decisions," "general guidelines," "common strategies," "common actions," "common positions" - a myriad that only experts can comprehend.
When a "directive" is issued, you don't know who is responsible; instead, they are known as, say, "Directive 17.62" (meaning that it is directive no. 17 issued in 1962).
In Italy there is now a controversial statute that will change the rules of criminal procedure in ways that might prove helpful to eminent public figures.
Well, the name of Senator Cirami is attached to that bill.
By god, we can fight about "the law Cirami"!
Would things be the same if the bill were called "Regulation 75"?
Because Europe has so many bodies that legislate - the Council of Ministers, the Council for Agriculture, the Council for Industry, the Council for the Environment, etc. - we cannot know who is doing what and why.
We need a single legislative council, a bicameral European Parliament, with one house representing member states, and the other the European electorate.
In this simplified system, legislation will be called legislation, and executive regulations, as in most legal systems, will fill in the gaps in primary legislation.
This is a system European citizens will understand.
The draft constitutional document presented last week introduces small but significant changes that may empower Europe's citizens to both identify with and criticize Europe.
It calls for a single, unified legal entity.
Whether it is called European Union, United States of Europe, United Europe, or something else, it will also provide for a unitary, simplified system of normative acts that will introduce more transparency and accountability.
The institutional structure envisaged by the proposed European Constitution should also reflect and help develop Europe's broader aspirations.
Europe must be more than a vehicle of economic integration, which is almost accomplished anyway.
At the simplest, we expect Europe to be fair.
We expect our social model to be realized.
We expect economic and social matters to be connected.
We expect Europe to play a role for good in the world.
Of course, roadblocks await.
One of them is that more Europe cannot mean a centralized system.
Democratic governments are too complicated for that.
Getting the proper balance among European, national, regional, and local institutions will be a crucial challenge.
But if the people are to ordain a Constitution for Europe, all of their ties and values will need to be respected by that Constitution.
Europe's Crisis of Leadership
Much less positively, EU member states have been slow to act in concert.
At first it was the European Commission that drew criticism for its slowness in making proposals to rally national governments and their policymakers.
Now it is the member states that are resisting the urgent need for a coordinated EU-wide policy response to the deepening crisis.
The speed and the severity of the economic slowdown are far greater than any of the post-war downturns of the past 60 years.
In Europe, we by and large failed to heed the warning signals of America's sub-prime mortgage crisis when it erupted in the late summer of 2007, and thus were unprepared when the next phase of the crisis engulfed European banks, too.
The lesson to be drawn is that the EU must move more quickly and with greater determination than has been the case so far.
Throughout the EU, people are asking, "What is Europe doing to address the crisis?" The answer is "not nearly enough," and the political price may be high at next summer's European Parliament elections.
The remaining weeks of 2008 will be crucial to Europe's efforts to regain the initiative and to attempt to attenuate the effects of the crisis while also addressing unresolved problems on the EU reform agenda.
As Trustees of Friends of Europe , we would urge the European institutions and EU political leaders to renew their efforts regarding both the Lisbon Treaty and the Lisbon Agenda.
France's EU Presidency has done much to improve coordination between member states' responses to the financial crisis, and the European Commission has also begun to play the more active role that Friends of Europe called for on October 10.
The challenge now is for the presidency and the Commission to give fresh political impetus to the EU's stalled reform drive.
The December 11-12 European Council should signal clearly the timetable envisaged for re-opening the Lisbon Treaty's ratification process.
Failure to do so would bring the risk of still greater political problems after next June's European elections.
The Lisbon Treaty is a step towards adapting the EU's decision-making mechanisms to the twenty-first century and a membership of 27 or more countries.
The global nature of the current crisis makes it plain that Europe must be able to decide quickly and coherently, or suffer adverse consequences.
There seems little doubt that public opinion across the EU is increasingly drawing the same conclusions.
The sovereign right of the Irish people to decide their own future is unchallengeable.
But Ireland should also allow the EU's other member states to proceed with the Lisbon Treaty if that is what they wish.
Even if another referendum is to be held in Ireland, the Irish government should foresee a procedure that, irrespective of the outcome, allows other member states to implement the essential parts of the Lisbon treaty.
The Commission now needs to take action to ensure that member states redouble their efforts with regard to the Lisbon Agenda for overhauling Europe's global competitiveness.
In 2000, the EU set a ten-year program of agreed reform targets, yet in many cases its member states have lacked the political will to implement them.
Europe's increasingly gloomy prospects make these reforms more necessary than ever.
The Gazpromization of European Energy Security
Concerns in the EU over energy security, fueled by increasing dependence on Russia, have never been greater.
Together with the Russian authorities' expropriation of oil company Yukos, foreigners have been squeezed out of Russia's energy extraction sector.
Inevitably, many in Europe are questioning the value of the Kremlin's word.
Rather than turning away, the EU should seek deeper engagement and reciprocity.
It should facilitate further incorporation of Gazprom into the EU market through market liberalization and downstream integration.
Yet it must also press for Gazprom's ultimate restructuring and real market entry into Russia for European companies, because Russia's unwillingness to do so guarantees energy insecurity for Europe.
Indeed, the Putin administration established a track record of bending rules and bullying foreign investors, with the support of prosecutors, tax authorities, regulatory agencies, and courts.
At the same time, Gazprom has evolved into the dominant market-maker in gas for Europe, and its actions have made a mockery of EU efforts at greater collaboration with Russia.
Gazprom strategy deploys three tactics: co-optation -- cultivating partnerships with certain countries, political leaders, and corporations, as levers of its interests; preemption -- using upstream power and Russian diplomacy to manipulate downstream conditions and scoop up assets; and disaggregation -- dividing the EU through bilateral deals.
Gazprom's co-optation of Europe has been achieved mainly through Germany, where its partnerships with energy companies and banks have helped align the authorities with Russian aims.
Extensive lobbying, directly and by proxy, is underway to persuade European regulators to allow long-term supply contracts in the EU -- despite their deadening effect on competition.
Preemption by Gazprom has been accomplished through a raft of acquisitions.
Gazprom has flooded the market in Turkey, withheld gas in Ukraine, threatened to do so in Belarus, and offered preferential market access to willing partners, such as Italy.
In the Caucasus, the Kremlin has prevented Iran from establishing infrastructure to compete as a supplier of gas to Europe.
To stop Iran's gas, Russia effectively bought Armenia's entire energy sector, while its support for Iran's nuclear program helps maintain Iranian isolation, keeping away the Western money Iran would need to become a rival gas exporter.
Gazprom's dominance is reinforced by activities coordinated with the Kremlin to assert its influence in markets like Spain and Italy.
In exchange for gas deals with rival suppliers, such as Algeria, Russia has offered vast concessions on arms and preferential debt terms.
In other cases, the Kremlin acts punitively, as when it cut off oil supplies to Lithuania following the sale of the Mazeikiu Nafta refinery to a Polish company, or to Ukraine after its people voted for the "wrong" party.
The prime example of disaggregation is the Nord Stream pipeline, which appeals to Germany while angering Poland and the Baltic countries.
The undersea pipeline will cost three times as much as a new pipeline along existing land routes, undermines the energy security of Germany's eastern neighbors, and threatens the Baltic Sea's fragile ecosystem.
But, by delivering exports directly to Germany, Russia will be able to cut off gas to Ukraine, Poland, and the Baltic states without directly affecting West European supplies -- and Russia's recent behavior indicates that this is a real threat.
But Gazprom is worried about its upstream capabilities, as is evident from the decision to divert gas from its Shtokman field to Europe rather than liquify it for new North American markets.
As long as Gazprom remains opaque, Europe cannot know whether its key supplier is spending enough to develop future reserves.
The Kremlin's political battle to win control of Russia's energy sector has resulted in a dramatic reduction in the growth rate of domestic oil and gas production.
That is a problem for Europe.
Gazprom cannot be a partner to Europe if it does not invest in its own infrastructure, yet plays a leading role in stripping Russian private businesses, invests $14 billion in non-core assets, such as news media, and is run from the Office of the Presidential Administration.
The lights must not go out across Europe.
Brussels must demand transparency, symmetry, and the rule of law from Moscow, with the goal being a revolutionary integration of European and Russian energy markets.
Simultaneously, through the diversification of supply sources, massive investments in liquified natural gas (LNG), and a strong push in favor of the Nabucco pipeline and inter-connectors between the Mediterranean rim countries, Europe can move closer toward energy security.
The very downstream access Gazprom wants in Europe is the EU's trump card.
The EU should tell Gazprom that access to Europe's downstream assets is conditional on the reciprocal openness of Russia's energy sector.
The result would be a welcome place in the European energy market for a Russia that is both trusted and respected by its international partners.
Free Trade, Free Labor, Free Growth
Things are no better in Europe.
France has dealt the Doha round of World Trade Organization (WTO) negotiations a blow by rejecting the outline deal on agriculture.
European Commission President José Manuel Barroso believes that protectionist pressures are increasing. 
When the Doha trade round was launched shortly after September 11, 2001, there was plenty of international goodwill.
But disenchantment with globalization -- and, in some regions, fear of immigration -- has since set in.
A recent Financial Times/Harris poll in the US, Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Italy, and Spain found people nearly three times more likely to say that globalization is negative than positive.
Free trade would lead to an overwhelming boost to welfare everywhere, but especially in the developing world.
Grasping these benefits is potentially one of this generation's greatest challenges.
Increased negative sentiment could have the worst possible result: not just Doha's failure, but also the raising of trade and immigration barriers.
These barriers remain largely because further liberalization would redistribute jobs, income, and wealth in ways that governments fear would reduce their chances of remaining in power -- and their own wealth in countries where corruption is rife.
The greatest hope is thus getting the Doha round back on track.
But there is a big difference between a low-quality result and one that is more comprehensive.
If little more is achieved than phasing out farm export subsidies and a modest reduction in agricultural domestic support, our analysis shows that developing countries as a group would gain nothing, while high-income countries would gain just US$18 billion per year by 2015.
By contrast, if developing countries cut their tariffs by the same proportion as high-income countries, and services and investment were also liberalized, the global annual gains could climb as high as US$120 billion, with US$17 billion going to the world's poorest countries.
Moreover, the long-term impact of free trade is huge.
Recast as after calculating the net present value of the stream of future benefits, a realistic Doha outcome could increase global income by more than $3000 billion per year, $2500 billion of which would go to the developing world.
In addition, the experiences of successful reformers like Korea, China, India, and Chile suggest that trade liberalization immediately boosts annual economic growth rates by several percentage points for many years.
Eliminating subsidies and trade barriers would mean that resources could be used more efficiently, so there would be more scope to reduce inequality and poverty, social tensions, environmental degradation, malnutrition, and disease.
There would, of course, be costs.
Firms and workers would need to adjust as reform forces some industries to downsize or close and allows others to expand.
In addition, there are social costs to consider.
Yet the benefits of a successful Doha round are between 45 and 440 times higher than these costs.
This is clearly an extremely sound investment.
An "alternative" to Doha, whereby other high-income countries would follow the European Union's offer of duty-free access to products from Least-Developed Countries (LDCs) and African, Caribbean, and Pacific (ACP) small countries, would involve only a tiny fraction of global gains from trade reform.
Moreover, it may well hurt other poor countries -- thereby worsening inequality -- by encouraging resources to be allocated to activities that become uncompetitive following the next World Trade Organization agreement.
Europe's Military Revolution
BRUSSELS: Creating the euro -- a revolutionary innovation in an EU whose nature is to evolve slowly, by fits and starts -- provoked debate across the continent and beyond.
Plans for a common EU defense policy, however, have thus far attracted less attention.
No longer.
Americans increasingly ask: "Why bother?" and point to the efficacy of NATO.
Europeans often find such questions hard to answer, partly because there is no single answer.
For believers in a more united Europe, closer cooperation on defense is self-evidently desirable.
Others emphasize the pragmatic, pointing out that EU members can achieve far more in foreign/defense policy by working together than on their own.
These pragmatists stress the growing number of external challenges -- in the Balkans, Middle East, Africa or elsewhere -- requiring a concerted response.
A third argument, held by some French Gaullists and many EU left-wingers, says that Europe needs a common foreign and defense policy to resist American hegemony.
This anti-American view, however, is not widely held.
Supporters of a common EU foreign/defense policy see a Europe capable of looking after its own defense as a better partner for the US.
Confusion and doubts arise now because of vagueness about the likely uses of the Rapid Reaction Force, a key step in developing these common policies.
The Rapid Reaction Force, it is said, should be capable of fulfilling the so-called "Petersberg" tasks.
Yet "peacemaking" (one of those tasks) could cover anything from Operation Alba -- which in 1997 saw Italy lead a 6000-strong European force into Albania to suppress anarchy -- to an attack on Sierra Leone rebels resisting UN peacekeepers, to Gulf War type conflicts.
Because all EU governments know that, for the foreseeable future, Europe will be capable of only modest military operations there is no great value in defining now how the Rapid Reaction Force will be used.
America should welcome the increasing weight and sense of responsibility for Europe as represented by the Rapid Reaction Force.
True, America's role in NATO -- that ingenious device through which America retains, with Europe's blessing, an institutionalized influence over the continent -- would diminish.
For NATO would become a framework in which two major powers, instead of one big and 18 smaller ones, coordinate policies and responses to crises.
The gains here outweigh any inconvenience to America's freedom to maneuver.
Enhanced European capabilities would allow America to leave many instabilities in and around Europe in the care of its allies.
Moreover, adding defense to the informal acquis that would-be EU members must endorse will reduce pressure on NATO to enlarge.
An EU committed to its own defense, although not offering the same formal guarantees as NATO, offers candidate countries the prospect of belonging to a genuine security community.
More fundamentally, creation of a Europe whole and free, but also united, is America's greatest foreign policy success of the past half-century.
To complete that objective, the EU must become a fully-fledged international actor.
Thus the challenges posed to America by Europe's common and defense policy are primarily psychological.
In Europe, however, those challenges are matters of will and political leadership, which cannot come from committees.
Here we propose a number of institutional and policy reforms, including:
· Merging the jobs of Chris Patten, the external relations commissioner, and Javier Solana, the High Representative for foreign policy, so that the EU speaks with a single voice;
· Giving the new Brussels�based Political and Security Committee higher status to draw together both the inter�governmental and Community sides of foreign policy;
· Setting a Europe�wide target for national defense budgets, committing all member�states to spending at least 2% of GDP on defense, and 25% of their defense budgets on arms procurement and R&D;
· Creating a special EU defense budget, to finance common missions, capabilities and weapons programs;
· Establishing a Monitoring Group of force planners, based within the Council of Ministers secretariat, to co�ordinate the peer group pressure that should encourage governments to improve their military capabilities.
Authority to build coalitions, push governments to fulfill deadlines, generate support or take the blame for failure must come from that traditional source of leadership, the nation state.
Because no single EU state can provide the dominant leadership America provided NATO during the Cold War, Britain, France, and Germany must assume this role in Europe.
Were one of them to oppose common action, the cohesion and credibility of any EU undertaking would be destroyed.
But if these three are determined to push ahead, they will represent the will of most, if not all, other EU members.
Membership in this group of three entails, not the power to command, but the responsibility to lead.
If these three fail to agree in a crisis, Europe will be opting out; if united on taking action, Europe will be committed.
So Britain, France, and Germany must start thinking of the EU as a whole, carrying the greatest burden and taking the greatest risks.
Their leadership will need to be informal, transparent, and inclusive.
Unfortunately, at this moment, none is prepared for these unenviable, yet inevitable, tasks.
But their commitment to Europe's military revolution is bound to move them closer to fulfilling them.
The Age of Human Rights
NEW YORK: At the dawn of the 21st century, the United Nations has become more central to the lives of more people than ever.
Through our work in development, peacekeeping, the environment and health, we are helping nations and communities to build a better, freer, more prosperous future.
Above all we have committed ourselves to the idea that no individual -- regardless of gender, ethnicity or race -- shall have his or her human rights abused or ignored.
This idea is enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
It is the source of our greatest inspiration and the impulse for our greatest efforts.
Today, we know more than ever that without respect for the rights of the individual, no nation, no community, no society can be truly free.
Whether it means advancing development, emphasizing the importance of preventive action, or intervening -- even across state boundaries -- to stop gross and systematic violations of human rights, the individual has been the focus of our concerns.
The promotion and defense of human rights is at the heart of every aspect of our work and every article of the United Nations' Charter.
Above all, I believe human rights are at the core of our sacred bond with the peoples of the United Nations.
When civilians are attacked and massacred because of their ethnicity, as in Kosovo, the world looks to the United Nations to speak up for them.
When men, women and children are assaulted and their limbs hacked off, as in Sierra Leone, here again the world looks to the United Nations.
When women and girls are denied their right to equality, as in Afghanistan, the world looks to the United Nations to take a stand.
Perhaps more than any other aspect of our work, the struggle for human rights resonates with our global constituency, and is deeply relevant to the lives of those most in need -- the tortured, the oppressed, the silenced, and the victims of "ethnic cleansing" and injustice.
If, in the face of such abuses, we do not speak up and speak out, if we do not act in defense of human rights and advocate their lasting universality, how can we answer that global constituency?
For in a world where globalization has limited the ability of states to control their economies, regulate their financial policies, and isolate themselves from environmental damage and human migration, the last right of states cannot and must not be the right to enslave, persecute or torture their own citizens.
The UN's achievements in the area of human rights over the last fifty years are rooted in the universal acceptance of the rights enumerated in the Universal Declaration, and in the growing abhorrence of practices for which there can be no excuse, in any culture, under any circumstance.
Still, I believe it is not enough for the United Nations to be known by what we are against.
The world needs to know who we are against, no less.
In the age of human rights, the United Nations must have the courage to recognize that just as there are common aims, there are common enemies.
We should leave no one in doubt that for the mass murderers, the "ethnic cleansers", those guilty of gross and shocking violations of human rights, impunity is unacceptable.
The United Nations will never be their refuge, its Charter never the source of comfort or justification.
Perhaps the most important challenge lies in combating the most outrageous violations in the field of human rights -- the gross violations, which in too many cases include summary executions, widespread forced displacements, massacres, and indiscriminate attacks on civilians.
Of all gross violations, genocide knows no parallel in human history.
The tragic irony of this age of human rights -- where greater numbers are enjoying human rights than perhaps ever in history -- is that it has been repeatedly darkened by outbursts of indiscriminate violence and organized mass killings.
In Cambodia, in the 1970s, up to two million people were killed by Pol Pot's regime.
And in the 1990s, from Bosnia to Rwanda, thousands upon thousands of human beings were massacred for belonging to the wrong ethnicity.
Each time the world says "never again." Yet it happens again.
The vicious and systematic campaign of "ethnic cleansing" conducted by Serbian authorities in Kosovo appeared to have one aim: to expel or kill as many ethnic Albanians in Kosovo as possible, thereby denying a people their most basic rights to life, liberty and security.
The result was a humanitarian disaster throughout the entire region.
We all deeply regret that the international community, despite months of diplomatic efforts, failed to prevent this disaster.
What gives me hope -- and should give every future "ethnic cleanser" and every state-backed architect of mass murder pause -- is that a universal sense of outrage was provoked leading to the eventual return of the Albanian population to Kosovo.
Emerging slowly, but I believe surely, is an international norm against the violent repression of minorities, which will and must take precedence over concerns of state sovereignty.
It is a principle that protects minorities -- and majorities -- from gross violations.
Let me therefore be very clear: even though we are an organization of Member States, the rights and ideals the United Nations exists to protect are those of peoples.
No government has the right to hide behind national sovereignty in order to violate the human rights or fundamental freedoms of its peoples.
Whether a person belongs to the minority or the majority, that person's human rights and fundamental freedoms are sacred.
Financing adaptation to climate will be a formidable challenge, particularly as it involves additional costs above traditional development assistance -- at a time when foreign-aid budgets are under pressure.
Estimates of the amounts needed by developing countries to help them adapt to these challenges vary between $50 and $100 billion per year.
This is why British Prime Minister Gordon Brown's proposal to create a fund for climate change is so welcome.
Failing to act now will increase costs in the future -- both financial and humanitarian.
We all stand to lose from a reversal of the economic and social progress made across Africa in the past decade.
Burgeoning markets might disappear and investment opportunities evaporate, while the risk of political instability will increase.
Every percentage-point fall in growth has direct social consequences, whether on nutrition levels, infant mortality, or school attendance.
Every person pushed back into poverty is another step away from achieving the Millennium Development Goals.
Turkey, Europe and Middle-East Security
Many factors contributed to the French and Dutch objections to the proposed EU Constitution.
One -- usually unstated -- factor is a fear of Turkish membership in the Union.
That membership drive, however, has already transformed Turkey.
In order to prepare for EU accession, Turkey has undertaken vast and serious legal, political, and economic reforms.
Turkey's bureaucrats, politicians, and citizens united to fulfill the Copenhagen criteria for EU membership and tolerated the pain of the IMF-directed structural-adjustment programs.
The looming accession process will be even more painful, but Turkey's people are firmly resolved to face this challenge.
Turkey's transformation has already put an end to the Cold War-style security-state apparatus that ruled the country for half a century, and has changed the framework of the country's domestic and foreign policy.
By modernizing and democratizing at home, Turkey's politicians gained self-confidence in their ability to conduct a successful regional policy.
As a result, Turkey's leaders are now willing to pursue active diplomacy in the Middle East in an effort to minimize problems with neighboring countries.
Of prime importance is the fact that Turkey is emerging as a role model for those across the Middle East who are seeking reform and modernization.
This influence does not imply a hegemonic relationship, but rather points to an alternative path for reform and economic development that other primarily Muslim countries might take.
The EU is associated with peace, democracy, and economic development, while the Middle East is characterized by instability, authoritarianism, and economic backwardness.
Turkey's reform process shows that the latter is not an unavoidable destiny for the countries of the region.
In this respect, Syria and Iran appreciate Turkey's EU membership process.
They consider a European Turkey an opportunity to develop their own relations with the EU.
Turkey also shows that the supposed clash between democracy and security -- and, indeed, between democracy and Islam -- can be reconciled.
Other Muslim states seem to grasp this: recently, a Turk was chosen for the first time and by a majority vote to be Secretary General of the Organization of Islamic Countries.
Turkey's other major contribution comes through constructive diplomatic engagement in the region.
The Turkish government has adopted an active role as a promoter of peace and has reconfigured its policies toward a number of regional problems.
For example, Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan broke with tradition by displaying a critical attitude toward Israel's more hawkish policies in the occupied territories, and did so without severing diplomatic relations with Israel.
During a visit of Turkey's Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul to Israel in early January, there was serious discussion about Turkey assuming a mediating role between Israel and the Palestinians, as well as in future Syrian-Israeli talks.
Turkey, of course, did not join the US-led occupation forces in Iraq, but it has put enormous effort into mobilizing regional support for a stable Iraqi state.
Indeed, Turkish policymakers have, on a regular basis, brought the countries bordering Iraq together for discussions about the future of the region.
The United Nations Security Council has taken these meetings seriously and has requested further regional cooperation on the Iraqi question.
Turkey's constructive engagement with the EU creates a sense of trust in the West -- among Western leaders at least, if not yet the general population -- for its regional initiatives.
Yet Turkey is also succeeding in keeping an equal distance between both the EU and the US.
For example, Turkey is closer to the EU in its policies toward Iraq and Palestine, yet follows a line similar to that of the US in the Balkans and Cyprus.
In recent history, a variety of regional powers -- the Shah's Iran and Nasser's Egypt -- have arisen in the Middle East.
Turkey's arrival as a regional power is different in that its democratic structures make an active peacemaker, not a local bully.
This is both a necessary and a promising role, for the region needs a local dynamic force pushing for reform, transformation, and peace.
Turkey's experience shows that true security in the region requires internal stability and social peace.
With luck, this model can be exported throughout the Muslim world.
Consulting America is Futile
Although the tone of the dialogue has changed since the Bush administration came to power six months ago -- America's rhetoric is softer, and the presidents of both countries have established a personal rapport -- I personally don't think that this matters much.
After all, the most significant agreements between the two countries were reached by Russian and American leaders who were distinctly unfriendly.
Indeed, personal relations often interfere with diplomatic dialogue, and can be seen as substituting for serious solutions and negotiations.
So improved rhetoric matters only at the margin.
It is the practical dialogue that counts, and right now there is none.
This is especially true concerning the vital issues of strategic relations, including the ABM Treaty and offensive weapons.
I don't want to sound too gloomy but the Genoa agreements reached by Presidents Putin and Bush in Genoa, and the "consultations" that have occurred since, have no solid base and are leading to nothing.
Why all this talk about consultations?
Because America doesn't intend to hold talks.
Diplomatic talks say that when I give you something that you give me something in return.
I make a concession, and you make a concession in reply.
Diplomatic bargaining involves serious discussions and a search for a balance of interests.
But consultations?
In them, I give you my view, and you provide me with yours.
I say that I don't agree with you, and you don't agree with me.
That what "consultations" amount to -- nothing.
Of course one might say that consultations help clarify positions -- say, those provisions of the ABM Treaty that do not suit America.
But be realistic.
Washington is not going to lay its cards face up.
Why should it?
The Bush administration is embarrassed by the change in the lineup of forces in the Senate, the allies ask it not to act unilaterally, and it would not be diplomatically wise to break with Russia when US ties with China are difficult.
So, to soften these dilemmas, America engages in "diplomatic dancing" around the issues of offensive and defensive weapons, but discusses nothing in earnest.
One step forward, two steps back.
Statements at the top are subsequently disavowed by lower level officials.
This situation suits the Americans, because time appears on their side.
Continued diplomatic dancing will enable the US administration to resolve its problems with allies and the US Senate, convincing both that nothing terrible is going on so that it can gradually start doing what it wants.
America is not worried now by the issue of deploying a missile defense system, for it is not yet confident in any of its schemes.
It needs to test a wide range of activities prohibited by the ABM Treaty, including mobile, sea, and air-launched craft, and so on.
The ABM Treaty is a hindrance the Americans seek to erode in an atmosphere of mutual assurances and general political declarations, so as to smooth the shock.
This is why Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld did not hammer out any agreement during his recent visit to Moscow.
He simply restated America's position once again, speaking about the nuclear threat posed by rogue countries but actually meaning China.
The USA cannot say openly that the NMD system is aimed at China and its limited number of intercontinental ballistic missiles.
The consultations, up to and including the planned visit of Vladimir Putin to America this autumn will never produce practical agreements until a solid basis for negotiations, such as existed over the past 30 years, is created.
Meanwhile, America will use the time to start tests to do away with the ABM Treaty.
Indeed, the 1997 protocol on of strategic and theatre ABM systems allows for the US to tests numerous systems at permitted ceilings.
For example, it permits the testing of any weapons against targets flying at a speed of below 5 km/sec, and the testing of ground, sea, and air-launched interceptor missiles.
The only limitation is that ground- and air-launched interceptor missiles should fly at no more than 5.5 km/sec, and the permissible speed for sea-based interceptor missiles is 4.5 km/sec.
The Americans can work on these systems within the agreed ceilings for a long time.
In any case, America will not withdraw from the ABM Treaty in a huff as many people imagine.
They think the US president will say: "We notify all parties to the ABM Treaty (including Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan) that under Article 15 we will cease to regard ourselves as bound by the treaty provisions in six months in view of the appearance of a threat to national interests." This will not take place anytime soon.
Instead, America will only withdraw from the treaty when it starts deploying its anti-missile system, and this will not happen for several years.
The treaty will not be killed by a blow, but will be eroded and undermined, until everyone believes that the treaty is dead.
Meanwhile, the Americans will try to create reliable systems, and it is not a fact that they will succeed.
After all, previous attempts failed.
The technology was not ready then and nobody can guarantee that it is ready now.
Everything depends on technological achievements and on what Russia will do with its strategic nuclear deterrence.
If Russia slashes its nuclear arsenal to much, a US system designed for defense against China will be also effective against Russia, no matter what political declarations are made.
If the system the Americans are working to intercept 200 warheads, in 15 years such a system can be used to neutralize Russia in view of what we intend to do to our nuclear deterrence arsenal.
Human Rights Made Whole
It will now be up to the UN General Assembly to provide final approval of the Protocol. If adopted, this instrument can make a real difference in the lives of those who are often left to languish at the margins of society, and are denied their economic, social, and cultural rights, such as access to adequate nutrition, health services, housing, and education.  

Sixty years ago, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights recognized that both freedom from want and freedom from fear are indispensable preconditions for a dignified life. The Declaration unequivocally linked destitution and exclusion with discrimination and unequal access to resources and opportunities. Its framers understood that social and cultural stigmatization precludes full participation in public life and the ability to influence policies and obtain justice.

Yet this unified approach was undermined by the post-World War II logic of geopolitical blocs competing over ideas, power, and influence. Human rights were also affected by such Cold War bipolarity. Countries with planned economies argued that the need for survival superseded the aspiration to freedom, so that access to basic necessities included in the basket of economic, social, and cultural rights should take priority in policy and practice.
By contrast, Western governments were wary of this perspective, which they feared would hamper free-market practices, impose overly cumbersome financial obligations, or both. Thus, they chose to prioritize those civil and political rights that they viewed as the hallmarks of democracy.
Against this background, it was impossible to agree on a single, comprehensive human rights instrument giving holistic effect to the Declaration's principles. And, unsurprisingly, it took almost two decades before UN member states simultaneously adopted two separate treaties -- the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights -- encompassing the two distinct baskets of rights. However, only the former treaty was endowed with a follow-up mechanism to monitor its implementation.

In practice, this discrepancy created a category of "alpha" rights -- civil and political -- that took priority in the influential and wealthy countries' domestic and foreign policy agendas. By contrast, economic, social, and cultural rights were often left to linger at the bottom of the national and international "to do" lists.
Addressing this imbalance between the two baskets of rights, the new Protocol establishes for the Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights a vehicle to expose abuse, known as a "complaint mechanism," similar to those created for other core human rights treaties. This procedure may seem opaque, but by lodging a complaint under the Protocol's provisions, victims will now be able to bring to the surface abuses that their governments inflict, fail to stop, ignore, or do not redress. In sum, the Protocol provides a way for individuals, who may otherwise be isolated and powerless, to make the international community aware of their plight.

After its adoption by the General Assembly, the Protocol will enter into force when a critical mass of UN member states has ratified it. This should contribute to the development of appropriate human rights-based programs and policies enhancing freedoms and welfare for individuals and their communities.

Not all countries will embrace the Protocol. Some will prefer to avoid any strengthening of economic, social, and cultural rights and will seek to maintain the status quo. The better and fairer position, however, is to embrace the vision of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and promote unambiguously the idea that human dignity requires respect for the equally vital and mutually dependent freedoms from fear and want.
Democracy in Latin America
I am a firm believer in free trade and hope to see the proposed "Free Trade Area of the Americas" established, as scheduled, in 2005.
Still, I find it disconcerting that economic issues have eclipsed discussion about how to strengthen and consolidate democracy and human development in Latin America.
Much remains to be done in these areas.
If neglected, poverty and poor governance will begin to overshadow any success we have in promoting economic growth.
In an area where 12% of adults are illiterate and more than a fifth of the population lacks safe drinking water, focusing exclusively on economics is simply not enough.
In the Central American countries torn by war in the 1970s and 80s, peace agreements have been signed and democratic institutions are in place.
Yet, the weapons from those wars remain in the hands of former soldiers and rebels and are often sold on the street.
These weapons of wars past contribute to levels of violent crime so atrocious that many Central Americans feel greater fear for their safety today than they did during the years of civil war and rebellion.
But the ghosts of past violence are not confined to Central America. Caudillismo has been a bane throughout Latin America's history, and its shadow remains because many democratically elected governments have still not fully subordinated their militaries to civilian authority.
So, although we have not seen outright coup attempts of late, we still see levels of threat and rebellious behavior on the part some Latin American militaries that are unacceptable in mature democracies.
One example is the pressure placed on Chile's President Ricardo Lagos to spend outrageous sums of money on sophisticated fighter jets to "modernize" Chile's Air Force.
As long as military chiefs continue to hold undue power within their governments, spending priorities will be out of step with the needs of ordinary people, and democracy will remain threatened by the Damoclean Sword of a potential coup.
Like Caudillismo , another old ghost continues to haunt the continent - poverty.
Although Africa and South Asia suffer much higher rates of poverty, Latin America has the ignoble distinction of incorporating the greatest economic and social inequality within its societies.
Instead of finding ways to remedy this, we continue to condemn our children to poverty by failing to provide them a decent education.
Many countries went too far in fiscal reform programs during the 1980s and 90s, slashing not only wasteful public spending, but essential spending on health and education.
Without these basic building blocks, it will be impossible to ensure that the benefits of growth are widely shared.
Wealthy Latin Americans are not doing their part.
While European countries such as Sweden and France collect more than 45% of their gross domestic product in taxes, Guatemala collects a mere 9%.
The democratic principle of equality has a long way to go in order to deepen its roots here.
Elitism, on the other hand, remains deeply entrenched in our institutions and our cultures.
Perhaps not all culture is worth saving.
One reason for this lack of progress may be public apathy.
Very high voter turnouts usually occur in countries that recently struggled for and achieved democracy.
Soon after, however, voter turnout and enthusiasm decline as democracy becomes rooted.
Sadly, in Latin America, we are seeing a rapid loss of confidence in even new and hard�won democracies.
Opinion polls show that many voters believe their elections to be a choice between two evils, and that political leaders are generally corrupt.
Corruption, indeed, remains a disastrous force in our democracies, chasing away both foreign and domestic investment and, more ominously, people's trust in democracy as a valid form of government.
A lack of democratic tradition also shows itself in the strong�arming and legislative standoffs that often keep governments from producing results.
If democratic governments fail to "deliver the goods" by providing for basic human needs and promoting the stability and well�being of their societies we will all pay the price.
Such pseudo�democracies will be forcefully rejected in favor of new incarnations of the old totalitarian regimes of right and left.
For the seeds of these dictatorships lie dormant in Latin American soil.
They await only the irrigation of widespread discontent with today's elected governments.
Lest I am accused of undue pessimism, let me point out that not all the news is bad.
Nascent civil society organizations, which clamor for transparency and accountability from their governments, are beginning to have an impact.
While judicial systems remain suspect, the "bad apples" are finding it more difficult to intimidate those judges who uphold honor and the rule of law.
Recognition of human rights, too, is gradually becoming more widespread, and some of those responsible for truly heinous crimes in our inglorious past are being brought to justice.
Leaders who confuse immunity with impunity are increasingly being held accountable, although there remains much more to be done.
A relatively free press and global flows of information are having a positive impact on our social conscience.
An integral part of democracy, there can be no turning back from this.
If we get our priorities straight and invest heavily in education, our children will show us the way to the strong, open, and prosperous societies that we hope for in Latin America.
The Storm Before the Calm
As recently as September and October, the United States Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank both saw the risk of inflation as being roughly equal to the risk to growth.
Both were reluctant to lower interest rates markedly.
Indeed, financial markets may have taken the Fed's view on US inflation as representative of other central banks' outlook on inflation, reinforced by the surprising ECB decision of October 2 to keep interest rates on hold.
In October the US was on the cusp of the most significant turning point for inflation in the last 20 years.
Of course, forecasting inflation is notoriously difficult.
There have been large structural shifts in the world economy (e.g., trade and financial globalization) as well as in individual economies (such as the decline in trade union power).
Monetary policy itself has shifted to a far greater focus on inflation.
Moreover, energy and food price shocks can be both large and largely unpredictable, while the speed of price changes tends to increase with big shocks.
Most forecasting models used by central banks therefore put a large weight on recent inflation.
This approach tracks inflation quite well, except at turning points , because the models miss key underlying or long-term influences.
The turning point that the US and world economy are facing is straightforward.
Global output is probably falling faster than at any rate since World War II, except perhaps for 1974-1975.
Under these circumstances, large excess capacity develops and commodity prices fall.
Indeed, it seems unlikely that governments in China and similar emerging markets can compensate swiftly enough to boost domestic consumption.
And, with growing over-capacity, investment in goods production may fall even further, with serious implications for GDP.
Hence demand for commodities, which has been driven by emerging-market growth, has fallen sharply, and help decrease global inflation.
Eventually, lower commodity prices and lower inflation will act like a huge tax cut for households, allowing interest rates to fall further and thus stabilize economic activity.
Paradoxically, the faster oil prices now fall, the shorter the subsequent period of deflation will be, as further damage to the economies of industrial countries is avoided.
Since oil and food prices have fallen sharply, and probably have further to fall, while unemployment is soaring, our models suggest that consumer price inflation, particularly in the US, must fall at record rates over the next 6-12 months.
It is entirely possible that US inflation, measured over 12 months, will become negative by mid-2009..
So the policy debate now under way is about whether monetary policy can stem deflation and what happens if and when the "zero lower bound" on interest rates is reached.
The zero lower bound arises because nominal interest rates cannot fall below zero.
But if nominal interest rates stay positive, while inflation is negative, then real interest rates may become too high for an economy in recession, causing recession to become more severe and prolonged.
Deflation fears were mistakenly raised in 2001-2003, when the strong response of the US housing market and consumer spending to lower interest rates should have made the debate redundant.
Influenced by a misreading of the Japanese experience, this led to excessive protection against the "tail risk" of deflation.
Ironically, that policy response helped to fuel the credit and housing bubble, whose collapse has triggered the current recession, which may actually bring about deflation.
There are important differences between the structure of the Japanese and the US economies, including the enormously high level of liquid assets held by Japanese households, which tends to lead to lower consumption when interest rates fall.
These differences, and the lessons that have been learned from Japan's "lost decade" about the need to refinance the banking system, suggest that a "lost decade" for the US is most unlikely.
The Case for Mitigating Greenhouse Gas Emissions
Stern Review Report on the Economics of Climate Change amounts to a call to action: it argues that huge future costs of global warming can be avoided by incurring relatively modest cost today.
Critics of the Stern Review don't think serious action to limit CO2 emissions is justified, because there remains substantial uncertainty about the extent of the costs of global climate change, and because these costs will be incurred far in the future.
However, I believe that Stern's fundamental conclusion is justified: we are much better off reducing CO2 emissions substantially than risking the consequences of failing to act, even if, unlike Stern, one heavily discounts uncertainty and the future.
Two factors differentiate global climate change from other environmental problems.
First, whereas most environmental insults -- for example, water pollution, acid rain, or sulfur dioxide emissions -- are mitigated promptly or in fairly short order when the source is cleaned up, emissions of CO2 and other trace gases remain in the atmosphere for centuries.
So reducing emissions today is very valuable to humanity in the distant future.
Second, the externality is truly global in scale, because greenhouse gases travel around the world in a few days.
As a result, the nation-state and its subsidiaries, the typical loci for internalizing externalities, are limited in their remedial capacity.
(However, since the United States contributes about 25% of the world's CO2 emissions, its own policy could make a large difference.)
Thus, global climate change is a public good (bad) par excellence .
Cost-benefit analysis is a principal tool for deciding whether altering it through mitigation policy is warranted.
Two aspects of that calculation are critical.
First, it has to be assumed that individuals prefer to avoid risk.
That is, an uncertain outcome is worth less than the average of the outcomes.
Because the possible outcomes of global warming in the absence of mitigation are very uncertain, though surely bad, the uncertain losses should be evaluated as being equivalent to a single loss greater than the expected loss.
The second critical aspect is how one treats future outcomes relative to current ones -- an issue that has aroused much attention among philosophers as well as economists.
At what rate should future impacts -- particularly losses of future consumption -- be discounted to the present?
The consumption discount rate should account for the possibility that, as consumption grows, the marginal unit of consumption may be considered to have less social value.
This is analogous to the idea of diminishing marginal private utility of private consumption, and is relatively uncontroversial, although researchers disagree on its magnitude.
There is greater disagreement about how much to discount the future simply because it is the future, even if future generations are no better off than us.
Whereas the Stern Review follows a tradition among British economists and many philosophers against discounting for pure futurity, most economists take pure time preference as obvious.
However, the case for intervention to keep CO2 levels within bounds (say, aiming to stabilize them at about 550 ppm) is sufficiently strong to be insensitive to this dispute.
Consider some numbers from the Stern Review concerning the future benefits of preventing greenhouse gas concentrations from exceeding 550 ppm, as well as the costs of accomplishing this.
The benefits are the avoided damages, including both market damages and non-market damages that account for health and ecological impacts.
Following a "business as usual" policy, by 2200, the losses in GNP have an expected value of 13.8%, but with a degree of uncertainty that makes the expected loss equivalent to a certain loss of about 20%.
Since the base rate of economic growth (before calculating the climate change effect) was taken to be 1.3% per year, a loss of 20% in the year 2200 amounts to reducing the annual growth rate to 1.2%.
In other words, the benefit of mitigating greenhouse gas emissions can be represented as the increase in the annual growth rate from today to 2200 from 1.2% to 1.3%.
As for the cost of stabilization, estimates in the Stern Review range from 3.4% of GNP to -3.9% (since saving energy reduces energy costs, the latter estimate is not as startling as it appears).
Let's assume that costs to prevent additional accumulation of CO2 (and equivalents) come to 1% of GNP every year forever, and, in accordance with a fair amount of empirical evidence, that the component of the discount rate attributable to the declining marginal utility of consumption is equal to twice the rate of growth of consumption.
A straightforward calculation shows that mitigation is better than business as usual -- that is, the present value of the benefits exceeds the present value of the costs -- for any social rate of time preference less than 8.5%.
No estimate of the pure rate of time preference, even by those who believe in relatively strong discounting of the future, has ever approached 8.5%.
These calculations indicate that, even with higher discounting, the Stern Review's estimates of future benefits and costs imply that mitigation makes economic sense.
These calculations rely on the report's projected time profiles for benefits and its estimate of annual costs, about which there is much disagreement.
Still, I believe there can be little serious argument about the importance of a policy aimed at avoiding major further increases in CO2 emissions.
Has Financial Collapse Saved Russia?
MOSCOW: Something surprising has happened to the Russian economy.
Last August, Russia experienced financial collapse, defaulting on treasury bills as its stock market plunged 94% from its October 1997 peak.
The ruble was devalued to one quarter of its prior value.
Half of Russia's banks closed, and many Russians lost their savings, while living standards fell by some 30%.
In September, inflation skyrocketed to 38% a month, and industrial production plummeted by 15%.
Russia seemed in an economic free-fall.
Both GDP and industrial production fell by 5% in 1998, and the IMF forecast a further decline in GDP of 9% in 1999.
Now everything has changed.
Russia is turning around.
Industrial production has recovered month by month.
It surged by 6.1% in May, and it is heading towards growth of at least 5% this year, though GDP might barely rise as many services are contracting with domestic consumer demand.
While Russian statistics remain poor, the reversal is too great to be in doubt.
The most obvious reasons for the sudden upturn is the devaluation, which caused an instant halving of imports and made exports cheaper, and rising oil prices.
Industries that have grown the most, however, are not raw materials but intermediary goods, such as chemicals, pulp, paper, and construction materials, and some manufactured goods, notably microbiology, pharmaceuticals, machinery, textiles, shoes, glass and porcelain.
The expansion for some products exceeds 30% in a year, while other industries continue to contract.
You see the effect in the streets of Moscow.
Suddenly, good Russian products are everywhere, while Moscow used to import 80% of the goods it consumed daily.
Moscow had many good, expensive restaurants, but now plenty of good cheap eating places have surfaced, as limited demand forces Russian producers to penetrate all markets and not only skim markets for the rich.
Much has been written about the barterization of the Russian economy, but since August 1998 this tendency has been reversed.
The share of barter in inter-enterprise transactions fell from 54% then to 46% in January, and partial evidence suggests that it has plummeted below 40% now.
For instance, in December 1998, the Russian utility giant Unified Energy System (now headed by the former privatization czar Anatoli Chubais) collected 20% of all payments in cash, but in May, this share had risen to 32%.
Russians have started using money as everybody else, and the virtual economy is dwindling.
Similarly, the infamous inter-enterprise arrears are swiftly contracting, as enterprises force each other to pay.
Big enterprises pay ever more of their taxes in real money rather than in promissory notes of dubious value.
The notorious wage arrears have declined steadily every month since October 1998.
There is no longer any escape for big loss-makers who are forced into bankruptcy, while sound enterprises expand in their place.
The number of bankruptcies has multiplied in a year, while the number of profitable enterprises has increased greatly, as a radical differentiation is occurring between successful and failing enterprises, signifying radical enterprise restructuring.
Evidence is plentiful.
A qualitative breakthrough is taking place, and not only a temporary improvement caused by devaluation and higher oil prices.
The financial crash did bring about fundamental change in the Russian economy.
Financial crisis at long last made hard budget constraints credible.
The very fierceness of the financial crash convinced everybody that there was no longer any free money that enterprises had to manage on their own.
The IMF and World Bank no longer offered the government cheap credits.
Foreign portfolio investors, who contributed capital equal to 10% of GDP in 1997, were scared away.
As the government defaulted on its domestic treasury bills, no government bonds found takers.
Initially, the Primakov government tried some monetary financing, but it soon realized that it only led to high inflation.
There was no way to raise taxes or state revenues significantly.
Therefore, the government cut public expenditures by 5% of GDP this year.
Finally, the bank crash eliminated the problem of irresponsible bank credits.
Russian entrepreneurs realized that they had to sell products that could be sold on the market at a profit.
Russia's problem was not at all a lack of demand or credit, but on the contrary the absence of a demand barrier.
The Russian bank system turns out to have been more harmful than useful.
Contrary to expectations, the payments system now functions much better with the worst half of the bank system bankrupted.
After all, Russian banks did not instill enough confidence to attract vast deposits, and they had neither the necessary information nor skills to lend sensibly.
While bankruptcies often are fraudulent, the key is that the worst villains are forced to close down.
A Putin Boom?
MOSCOW: Vladimir Putin has more to celebrate than his election as Russia's president in his own right.
After a decade of horrific turmoil, Russia's economy is at last turning around.
Recently, the Moscow brokers Brunswick Warburg predicted that Russia's GDP will surge 5% this year.
That growth should give President Putin - if he is patient and persistent - leeway to tackle the longer term reforms his country needs if it is to become the powerful state he seeks it to be.
Until now, a broad consensus forecast 1-2% growth in Russia this year.
The reason behind that uninspiring consensus is simple: people - economists and investors alike - have become so pessimistic about Russia that they no longer can see positive facts.
The conventional wisdom is that Russian industrial growth is only an effect of high oil prices and import substitution, facilitated by a great devaluation of the ruble.
Considering that Russia's growth was 3.2% last year, a staggering 8.8% in the last quarter, this makes little sense.
Growth, indeed, is accelerating.
Dynamism like this does not stop without a major shock.
Industrial growth was 8.1% last year, and has accelerated since, to 14% in February.
Oil and gas have not led the recovery; indeed, they stagnated last year.
Major industries with 16-22% growth were chemicals, light manufacturing, pulp and paper, and machine building; that is, intermediary goods and simple manufacturing, exactly the kind of industries economists like to see expanding at this stage of a recovery.
Within each industry, the best enterprises dash ahead, as should be the case when real restructuring is taking place.
Another tired argument is that Russia's growth is superficial and not generated by investment.
However, recovery in transition economies from Estonia to Poland to Hungary is usually export led.
Investments tend to follow recovery, as there is so much underutilized capital around.
Even so, investment actually increased by 6% in 1999 and is rising further.
But the most over-hyped argument concerns Russia's feeble tax collection.
But this obscures the real issue, which is excessive government expenditures.
Last year the government put its finances in order by cutting wasteful and corrupt expenditures, such as enterprise subsidies.
The total government budget deficit stopped at 1.7% of GDP.
This year it will be nearly eliminated.
Barter and arrears (ie, debts between factories and firms), long major concerns, are also diminishing.
Since the financial crash of August 1998 all kinds of arrears have fallen by two/thirds in real terms and barter by half.
One reason was that in 1999 almost 10,000 loss-making Russian enterprises were put into bankruptcy.
The financial crash introduced hard budget constraints on Russian enterprises; they realized they had to make money, prompting rapid monetization.
Today, we are seeing the structural changes that we had hoped to see years ago.
Russia is getting some return from the substantial structural reforms it has actually undertaken.
The last real worry was the foreign balance.
Russia has a substantial foreign debt service, but the recent London Club deal reduced Soviet-era debt to commercial banks by half, easing the pressure mightily.
A similar deal is likely in the Paris Club for the regulation of debts to governments.
During the last few months Russia's international reserves have grown sharply, as one would expect of a country with a staggering trade surplus of $33 billion this year and which is likely to surge to over $40 billion this year.
Of course, Russia is still hemorrhaging money.
But the cause of Russia's so-called capital flight is a poor bank system and its dysfunctional tax system.
Fortunately, Russia now has such liberal currency regulations that Russians can keep their money in good international banks instead.
All of these changes mark the beginning of the end of the era of the oligarchs, ushered in with the presidential elections of 1996.
Mr. Putin has no need for the oligarchs to provide him with media support to avert a communist threat or offer a conduit for covert state financing.
To him, Boris Berezovsky and his cronies are a nuisance; most are already been broken to Putin's will.
Instead, a new group of Russian businessmen, mainly manufacturers, are rising.
Their increasing strength is a reflection of robust economic growth, which promotes production for the market rather than sheer redistribution of resources, implying a new sort of politics.
Last October, McKinsey Global Institute published a major empirical report of Russian industry.
Its conclusion was that Russia had real and human capital suitable to sustain a growth rate of 8% a year, and that its problem was primarily the distortions imposed by a poorly functioning tax system and the absence of a land market.
However, neither the bank system nor the legal system were actually impediments at this stage of development.
They will become important as Russia moves to the next stage of growth, and so these new businessmen are demanding these reforms.
Mr. Putin is no great thinker or reformer, but he is astute and genuinely popular.
He is likely to surf on the current wave of economic growth, using broad consensus about the need for reform to clean up the state administration, and liberalize a tax regime which, though grossly inefficient, is heavy-handed when it goes after a company.
Land reform remains so controversial he may shrink from addressing the issue.
My greatest worry is not Putin but that Russia will face an excessive inflow of foreign portfolio investment again, as in 1997.
Fortunately, the bond markets are dead, and it might take a year to revive them.
Their absence makes it difficult to invest too large amounts of money in Russian securities.
Something fundamental has changed in the Russian economy.
A time comes when all disasters have occurred and all stupidities are recognized.
For Russia, August 1998 marked that dividing line.
It was a horrendous shock, imposing great social costs, but it changed Russia's mentality, not only the exchange rate.
The Three Faces of Putin
MOSCOW: Being president of Russia is often caricatured as being like a tsar, but the powers of President Vladimir Putin are more constrained than the Kremlin's former autocrats and Politburo chieftains.
An obvious sign of this is the amount of time Putin spends on foreign trips with little diplomatic justification.
Diplomacy, however, allows a president opportunity to enhance his authority for future domestic battles.
The constraints Putin faces are not constitutional but are formed by the three factions that make up his government.
One is a group of FSB (the successor agency to the KGB) men from St. Petersburg, headed by Security Council Secretary Sergei Ivanov.
The second consists of liberal economists and lawyers from Putin's home town of St. Petersburg, with Minister of Finance Alexei Kudrin and Minister of Economy German Gref the leading lights.
The third faction is an "oligarchic" business-oriented group led by Putin's chief of staff Alexander Voloshin, Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov and the secretive oil and aluminum tycoon Roman Abramovich, perhaps Russia's richest man at age 33.
Because of these three very visible fault lines, some Russians describe their country as having distinct security, economic, and political/business governments.
The FSB people naturally focus on security, law, and order.
The St. Petersburg liberals pursue market economic reforms.
But, as under Yeltsin, it is the oligarchic faction that dominates, for it controls the Presidential Administration, the Council of Ministers, two centrist parliamentary factions, and much of Russia's oil, aluminum, railways and nuclear industries.
So far, Putin has compromised with the oligarchic force, which has reduced his personal imprint on policies.
It is too powerful and skillful to be challenged head-on.
Kremlin policymaking is largely an interplay between these three factions.
The institutional checks and balances built into Russia's constitution have been neutralized.
Rampant corruption has discredited regional governors as a counterweight.
Indeed, the financial crash of August 1998 was provoked in large measure by governors issuing big subsidies to friendly local enterprises and demanding kick-backs in return.
By slashing subsidies from regional budgets, federal revenues increased from 9% of GDP in 1998 to 17% of GDP this year.
Not a surprise, then, that the governors cannot mobilize popular support as federal authorities impose accountability standards on them.
The State Duma has also faded.
Under Yeltsin, deputies' votes were routinely purchased; now the Kremlin's FSB faction pressures deputies by reminding them of their past bribe-taking.
Parliamentarians complain about "KGB threats," but honesty doesn't seem a lot to ask of Duma members.
The real problem in policymaking is forging agreement between Putin's three factions.
Take the example of the Kursk disaster.
The politics of the sunken submarine were handled by Sergei Ivanov.
The other factions thought that he deserved the hostile criticism that followed in the wake of the Kremlin's bumbles, and the liberals hoped that this debacle would reinforce independent media.
As no faction embraces the military, an expected rise in defense expenditures has been insignificant; indeed, Putin is slashing 600,000 men from Russia's military.
All three factions applaud the downfalls of media oligarchs Boris Berezovsky and Vladimir Gusinsky, but for different reasons.
The FSB favors keeping the media under the Kremlin's thumb.
Abramovich, brought to the fore by Berezovsky, is eliminating his competitors.
Liberals see Berezovsky and Gusinsky as the main practitioners of corruption and responsible for the demise of market reform in 1997.
Thus, the outstanding issue is media freedom, with the FSB faction and the liberals opposing one another.
Neither the FSB people nor the oligarchs focus on economic policy beyond their immediate interests, abandoning that field to the liberals, who radically reformed taxes, cleaned up the state budget, and monetized the economy by curbing barter.
Pension reform with private savings accounts and land reform leading to private ownership of land seem within reach.
Prospects for economic reform have never been brighter than in 2000.
The main problem is producing well-designed reforms backed by key officials.
Here a big problem arises from the fact that industrial ministers continue to interfere because they represent business interests or are even in business themselves.
Last September, Minister of Communications Leonid Reiman, a key member of the St. Petersburg FSB group, deprived two leading Russian mobile phone companies of their frequencies so as to benefit a company favored by him.
Fortunately, his decision was reversed by the government after public uproar.
In the coming year, Putin's big test will be over control of gas monopoly Gazprom, now co-owned by its managers and the state.
Its long-time CEO Rem Vyakhirev departs next May.
Incredibly, Russia's largest company - with one third of the world's gas reserves - is unprofitable because of poor management and theft.
Billions of dollars are siphoned off each year through companies allegedly controlled by Gazprom managers.
Clearly, Putin wants to end this robbery of state assets, and minority shareholders are up in arms, but the insatiable Abramovich wants Gazprom, and Voloshin yearns to become its next CEO.
Will Putin stand against them?
A smaller drama concerns Russia's railways.
Railway Minister Nikolai Aksenenko, who belongs to the oligarchic family, wants to turn the rail system into a monopoly akin to Gazprom, while the St. Petersburg liberals want to divide the rail network into competing private companies.
The outcome remains unclear.
Beside Gazprom, the banking system is Russia's economic black hole.
No sensible person keeps money in a Russian bank.
Here, the stumbling block is the old-style apparatchik Viktor Gerashchenko, Chairman of the Central Bank of Russia, who thrives on the mess.
Because he is not involved in the power struggle, and since banking reform is a huge task, nobody seems prepared to take him on.
Daily, each of Putin's three faces can be seen.
The future of his presidency will depend on which two ever will join into a unified faction.
Whither Putin's Regime?
Whenever I arrive in Moscow, I am impressed by its new shops and buildings.
But another key aspect of the Yeltsin era - its rollicking debates - has fallen silent.
Part of the explanation for this is increased official control, part is declining public interest, and part is that Russia's problems nowadays simply seem less urgent.
After the government seized influence over the independent television networks, NTV and TV6, Russia's media became vastly duller.
The latest fad is for officials to sue newspapers for libel, demanding over $1 million.
Russian journalists are often corrupt, and tens of thousands of dollars are paid for a single defaming TV program or newspaper article.
Yet, systematic silencing of Russia's media is unnecessary.
The reason for this is simple: the lives of ordinary people are improving, so they support Putin willingly.
Their main concern is the falling growth rate - from 9% in 2000 to 3.5-4% this year - yet output statistics keep rising.
Indeed, the only big macroeconomic debate concerns exchange rate policy, where Presidential advisor Andrei Illarionov argues that Russia's real exchange rate is too high - indeed, is now as high as in 1998.
But if the exchange rate is about to cause trouble, there is still good news on the money front.
At long last, Viktor Gerashchenko is out as Chairman of the Central Bank of Russia, replaced by First Deputy Minister of Finance Sergei Ignatiev.
Arguably, Gerashchenko was the most harmful office-holder during the transition.
He maintained Russia's Central Bank as a bureaucratic and murky monster of 80,000 bureaucrats (America's Fed, by contrast, has only 10,000 employees).
Gerashchenko blocked all bank reforms ranging from restructuring, liberalization and privatization to deposit insurance.
He resigned because the State Duma adopted a new law on the Central Bank that introduced minimal accountability.
I have known Mr. Ignatiev since 1991.
He arrived with Anatoli's Chubais' team from St. Petersburg in November that year, first becoming deputy minister of finance and soon deputy chairman of the CBR.
Gerashchenko sacked him as unsuitably competent, honest and reformist.
Hardly any Russian official has a more stellar reputation for honesty and integrity than Ignatiev.
He is an outstanding hard-working civil servant and a good reformer.
The question is whether the soft-spoken Ignatiev can undertake a major re-organization.
Ignatiev is likely to pursue a transparent and competent monetary policy and introduce deposit insurance.
He will probably privatize the large state Vneshtorgbank and clean up the state savings bank, Sberbank.
In December 2003, Russia will hold its next parliamentary elections, and people are reviewing what reforms are possible before then.
The most significant reform is the introduction of real private ownership of agricultural land, expected this fall.
Limited pension reform has been passed. Some insufficient tax improvements for small enterprises are under way.
A new labor code has been adopted, but delivers scant liberalization because it does not reduce the mandatory severance pay of three months' salary and enhances the role of the official trade unions.
The biggest scandal is that reform of the collapsing public health care system is unlikely. The social benefit system remains aimed at the privileged.
While reform loses prominence, steps are taken in the wrong direction.
In late March, the government adopted new measures to protect Russia's car industry, proposed by the young oligarchs Oleg Deripaska and Alexei Mordashov.
Deripaska has acquired a monopoly of Russia's aluminum and bus production.
Now he wants the car industry.
Import tariffs for cars will be raised from their current 25% - the highest tariff - to a prohibitive 70% for imported cars older then seven years, which compete with new Russian cars.
The import of hundreds of thousands of old Western cars each year has raised living standards for Russia's new middle class.
President Vladimir Putin appears determined that Russia should enter the World Trade Organization (WTO) before the next Duma elections in December 2003.
This new protectionism raises problems.
Deripaska is leading the campaign to slow Russia's accession to the WTO.
Both chambers of the parliament are reformist.
The political problem lies within the government, which contains few reformers.
Any government decision needs to be signed by a score of senior officials with no political mandate but who maintain Soviet views.
Russia's bureaucratic apparatus has grown after communism, extending its dead hand over society.
Public administration reform is vital, but cannot occur until after the next elections.
Putin is increasingly seen as isolated.
Focused on grand international politics, he is less involved in actual policy.
Still, his popularity remains undented.
Few Russians see him as a threat; most see him as a hope.
Three forces of darkness are apparent.
The first is public complacency.
The second force is the Soviet bureaucracy.
The third is composed of new big businessmen pushing protectionism.
None of these forces is frightful, but each may stall reform for the next two years.
When leaving Moscow, I was reminded that since October, the green channel in the customs has effectively been abolished.
Previously, you could take out $1,500 without a customs declaration.
Every single dollar has to be documented - again.
Soviet bureaucracy is creeping back.
The Vanishing Swedish Exception?
For the past two years, Western Europe's voters have been turning rightward.
In Denmark, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, and Portugal, concerns about immigration, chronic unemployment, high taxes, and deteriorating public services have fuelled this trend.
But as Europe's most recent parliamentary election shows, Sweden's Social Democrats--in power for 61 of the past 70 years--remain relatively immune to serious challenges from the right.
Opinion polls just a few months ago gave the Social Democrats 44% popular support.
Together with the former Communists and the Greens, the left held a comfortable 12-15% lead over the four non-socialist parties.
Why has Sweden held out against the right-wing tide sweeping so much of Western Europe?
The immediate reason for Social Democracy's enduring appeal is foreign policy.
In early 2001, Sweden held the EU presidency, giving Prime Minister Göran Persson, the country's dominant politician, a bright spotlight in which to shine.
The Social Democrats also benefited by supporting the US after the September 11
Persson exudes competence and authority.
He bolstered his image considerably after winning the 1994 election by tightening government finances and eliminating a huge fiscal deficit.
But he has done nothing remarkable since winning again in 1998.
Sweden's economy rose and fell with the IT bubble, reflected in telecoms giant Ericsson's troubles today.
Persson's main advantages entering this year's campaign were that he was unencumbered by new promises and was well equipped to run a presidential-style contest based on his personal appeal.
But force of character cannot mask real problems and a changing political agenda.
Although foreigners often idealize Sweden's welfare state, its economy has been losing ground steadily for 30 years.
In 1970, GDP per head was the fourth highest in the world; now it is 17
Conservatives demand lower taxes, but this is unpopular: almost 65% of Swedes live on public salaries or social transfers.
Unlike other Europeans, Swedes are thus much keener to keep taxes high, which guarantees a large left-wing vote.
Even so, Swedes fret about the deteriorating quality of services provided by the social welfare system.
They complain about year-long waits for eye operations and hip surgery--a direct result of a Social Democratic reform of 1994 that abolished the right of patients to seek alternative care at public expense if they are not treated within three months by their regional council.
The Social Democrats shrewdly reversed themselves on this point during this year's campaign, but health care entitlements have clearly gone too far.
No less than 14% of Swedish employees are currently registered as sick, double the number five years ago.
The Social Democrats argue that this reflects a serious health problem, while non-socialists suggest that the system is defective.
Many Swedes have come to believe that it is their right to register as sick regardless of their health .
No other evidence suggests that public health is actually declining.
Deteriorating public education poses another worry.
Stockholm, ruled by conservatives and liberals, has extended its free-market experiments, such as privatization of subway trains, to education vouchers and free choice of alternative schools.
The Social Democrats lost miserably in the capital.
As in most recent European elections, immigration loomed large, but as usual, Sweden was out of step with other countries.
The small Liberal party, which campaigned in favor of free labor immigration, tripled its support.
The Liberals make the sensible argument that anybody with a job should get a work visa, but that knowledge of Swedish be a citizenship requirement and that unemployed immigrants be barred from receiving social benefits for five years.
Roughly 70% of Swedes support free immigration of laborers--far higher than elsewhere in Europe.
They see that immigrants tend to be qualified East Europeans, many of them physicians, while the number of Swedes registered as sick or in early retirement has underpinned a severe labor shortage.
Post-Soviet Free Trade
Ever since the Soviet Union collapsed, the independent states that emerged from the wreckage have tried to sort out their trade relations.
But the flow of goods between countries continues to contract even more than it should.
What is needed is free trade.
The twelve members of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) concluded an Agreement on a Free Trade Zone in 1994, but it does not work.
Whenever one member is successful in exporting to another, the importing member soon imposes quotas or prohibitive tariffs, impeding economic development.
The simple solution is a mechanism for conflict resolution.
The World Trade Organization (WTO) has a well-functioning arbitration court with accepted penalties that could be utilized, but only four CIS countries (Kyrgyzstan, Georgia, Moldova, and Armenia) have joined the WTO.
The largest CIS economies-Russia, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan-should hurry up and join as well.
Alas, instead of adapting tried and tested mechanisms, various CIS countries invent ever more complex schemes, such as the five-state Customs Union, which was renamed the Eurasian Economic Community last year, when its failure became evident.
The latest invention is the recent declaration by the Presidents of Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine to start negotiations on forming a "Unified Economic Space."
Three ideas are contained in this nebulous term: a customs union, coordination of accession to the WTO, and a currency union.
None of these will benefit any participant.
A CIS customs union failed already, and will fail again in the future.
It delivered no freer trade than the CIS free-trade zone.
No participant harmonized its customs with anybody else.
Russia refuses truly to accept the sovereignty of the other CIS states, and instead wants only to impose its own customs policy, which the others do not accept.
Now the four presidents propose an independent supranational commission for trade and tariffs in order to forge a common customs policy.
But there is no reason to believe that this will work any better.
Simply put, these countries have different foreign-trade interests.
A country that does not produce a product has no interest in its protection, while countries that do have protectionist interests.
For instance, Russia's automotive and aviation industries insist on high import tariffs, while Kazakhstan produces neither cars nor airplanes.
Russia's high import tariffs on cars would impose an unjustified consumer tax on Kazakhs.
Coordination in accession to the WTO sounds good, but would actually delay membership by several years at a time when speed is vital.
It is much more difficult for Russia, with its large and complex trade, to enter the WTO than it is for Ukraine and Kazakhstan.
Russia must conclude bilateral protocols with no less than 67 countries, compared with 22 for Ukraine.
Any coordination through a customs union would reopen concluded negotiations.
Indeed, Russia has demanded that Ukraine revoke the 11 bilateral protocols for WTO accession that it already signed.
Meanwhile, until Russia, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan accede to the WTO, the trade situation within the CIS will not improve.
If they would stop "cooperating" and start competing to be the first to enter the WTO, all three countries could be members within a year.
The worst idea is the currency union.
All twelve CIS countries had a currency union in 1992 and 1993.
It was an unmitigated disaster that ended in hyperinflation.
The fundamental problem was that each country had a central bank that issued ruble credits, because no country was prepared to accept central-effectively Russian-control over its monetary policy.
Why repeat that catastrophe?
None of the political preconditions has changed.
No CIS country would accept a Russian monopoly on the emission of a common currency, and without a central monopoly on the emission of money, a currency union cannot work.
Even if a currency union could work technically, it makes little economic sense, for several reasons:
First, a currency should be tied only to a currency with a substantial record of stability, whereas the CIS has seen the world's greatest currency instability in the last decade;
Second, a currency should be pegged only to a currency that is dominant in its foreign trade.
Russia accounts for just about a quarter of Ukraine's foreign-trade turnover;
Third, a currency union should be undertaken with a large, differentiated economy with substantial financial depth.
But these economies are small, and most are not highly diversified;
Fourth, the members of a currency union should have similar economic structures or at least have business cycles that move in parallel.
Given Russia's dependence on exports of oil and natural gas, and Ukraine's status as a major energy importer, the two countries' business cycles are likely to diverge rather than overlap.
Whereas Russia would require devaluation when oil prices fall, Ukraine could consider revaluation.
In short, none of the ordinary prerequisites for a currency union is in place, and the only rationale appears to be Soviet imperial nostalgia.
For the last three years, Russia, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine have been economically successful, with Russia and Ukraine boosting average annual economic growth rates of 6% and Kazakhstan around 11%.
Sound market-based thinking has driven their domestic economic policies.
None of them can afford to fool around with economic nonsense in their trade policy.
Is Putin Self-Destructing?
With the arrest of Russia's richest man, oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Russia has lurched into a deep political crisis.
Unwittingly, President Vladimir Putin has opted for an all-or-nothing victory over the oil oligarch.
At stake is nothing less than Russia's frail democracy.
The legal charges against Khodorkovsky concern old privatization and tax evasion cases.
But the charges against Khodorkovsky are as flimsy as they are tendentious: the privatization case had been amicably settled previously, and Khodorkovsky has merely used tax avoidance schemes that are commonplace in Russia--and that have been upheld in court.
Putin's real problem is that Khodorkovsky is too powerful and independent for the straitened politics he wants.
During his four years in power, Putin has advanced four major policies.
The first three--free market reform, the rule of law, and a pragmatic foreign policy--have been widely acclaimed, while the fourth--"managed democracy"--has been tolerated because it has brought political stability.
But "managed democracy" now threatens to unravel all three of his real achievements.
Khodorkovsky is the fourth major businessmen taken out of action by the authorities.
Four independent TV channels have also been taken over by the state, and no criticism of Putin is permitted in significant media.
The main polling organizations have also been brought under Kremlin control.
Regional elections are regularly manipulated, often by disqualifying leading opposition candidates.
The pattern is evident: a systematic authoritarian drive is underway.
Russia's oligarchs are undoubtedly unpopular, and Khodorovsky's arrest was evidently aimed at boosting Putin's prospects in the looming parliamentary and presidential elections.
But although Russians dislike the powerful, and cherish underdogs and martyrs, a man in jail no longer looks strong.
With Khodorkovsky's arrest, the authorities flaunted their extralegal and arbitrary powers in such a way that they have aroused widespread public worry.
Previously, Putin had enigmatically appealed to most Russians.
By balancing between ex-KGB people and big businessmen, he seemed independent of both.
Now he has antagonized all big businessmen; he even refuses to meet them.
Suddenly, he has reduced himself to KGB President, jeopardizing the very political stability he sought to guarantee.
Putin has spoken continuously about the need for the rule of law, but in his TV statement on October 27, he effectively stated his preference for law enforcers.
Indeed, in the Khodorkovsky affair, all procedural requirements have been blithely neglected.
For example, although prosecutors control the relevant courts, they did not bother to secure the necessary court orders for the Yukos raids and arrests.
The obvious conclusion that even ordinary Russians are drawing is that neither property rights nor people are safe.
Investments are likely to be stopped or delayed.
Those who can export capital will do so.
An emerging panic seems certain to dampen today's strong growth.
The fallout from Khodorkovsky's arrest is felt abroad as well.
The world's business press has roundly condemned the authorities' behavior, especially the impounding of Yukos shares worth many times more than possible state claims, which smacks of expropriation.
Foreign governments are voicing their fears.
In one stroke, Putin has jeopardized his considerable accomplishments.
With his public bluntness, he has discarded his prior coyness and deprived himself of deniability.
As the KGB culprits keep quiet, the President must do most of the talking, exposing himself further.
But why defend the arrest in a televised statement?
Why refuse to meet Russia's business elite, while meeting with foreign investment bankers?
Why seize Yukos shares and licenses?
A couple of weeks before his arrest, Khodorkovsky told me: "I do not understand how they can win, given how many mistakes they make."
His words seem prescient.
The situation in the Kremlin appears reminiscent of the spring of 1996, when a group of KGB men, led by President Boris Yeltsin's chief bodyguard, General Alexander Korzhakov, almost seized power.
But the oligarchs mobilized behind Anatoly Chubais, who ousted Korzhakov and his circle by June.
Once again, Russia's big businessmen have united behind Chubais.
If Putin wants to save his own skin, he must act fast and sack his top KGB aides in the Kremlin and the Prosecutor General.
It is worth recalling that in 1999 former Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov and Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov were seen as a shoo-in ticket for the presidency.
But, having curried favor with Russia's media, they were unaccustomed to criticism--and rendered helpless when it appeared.
The taboo against criticizing Putin is already powerless.
The main liberal parties--the Union of Rightist Forces and Yabloko--are attacking him ferociously, while the faceless parties that supposedly support him are silent and confused.
They are presumed to be on the verge of winning an overwhelming majority in the parliamentary elections due on December 7, yet like Korzhakov and his clique, they could be routed.
Indeed, by alienating big business and letting his wily chief of staff, Alexander Voloshin, resign, Putin has deprived himself of crucial electoral resources.
His former chief political advisor has even accused him of using "Stalinist measures."
If Putin falls short of the high expectations in the upcoming parliamentary election, his fortunes in the March 14, 2004, presidential vote may be jeopardy.
By arresting Khodorkovsky, Putin has revealed his authoritarian nature to the entire world.
He has thrown a gauntlet in the face of Russia's civil society and business elite.
They have little choice but to resist, and their strength should not be underestimated.
The battle for Russian democracy is joined anew.
Putin's Last Stand
Russia's President Vladimir Putin was incredibly successful in achieving his goals during his first term.
He strengthened the power of the federal government, while defeating big business, free media, the communist party, the liberal parties and civil society.
Within government, he squezzed regional governors, both chambers of parliament and even the government apparatus, concentrating all legislative, executive and judicial power in himself.
Meanwhile, solid macroeconomic stability and steady growth of 6.5% a year were attained.
Alas, Putin's success may lead to his downfall.
He was fortunate during his first term because he recognized limits to his power.
An avid reader of opinion polls, he tried enigmatically to be everything to all voters.
Now, he seems to think himself free of constraint, but no politician is that lucky.
Putin is violating too many rules of politics, and just cannot stop.
Putin is too jealous of power to delegate.
Because he wants to make all decisions, he replaced a strong prime minister and chief of staff with two men unable to make decisions.
So rather than creating a strong vertical command, he paralyzed his government.
One reason for this extreme overcentralization is that Putin does not trust anyone.
Another reason is his preoccupation with secrecy.
A true secret policeman, he relies on his circle of KGB men from St. Petersburg.
His power base shrinks by the day, and his strangling of independent information makes him increasingly ill-informed.
Law enforcement failed the population.
It possessed no relevant intelligence.
Policemen accepted bribes to let the terrorists though.
Russia's best special forces were sent to Beslan, but they were not given ammunition, body armor, battle plans, or operative command.
The school was never cordoned off.
In the end, local Ossetians stormed the school with their own guns and killed several special troops in contempt.
Incredibly, the Chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB) and the Minister of Interior arrived in Beslan soon after the siege started, but hid doing nothing.
Similarly, the two regional governors concerned refused to go to Beslan.
In fact, nobody from the government did anything.
Putin and his government simply ignored the Beslan crisis, minimizing news coverage about it.
It is difficult to imagine a worse government performance.
In his time, Soviet President Leonid Brezhnev was ridiculed for only being interested in concealing bad news and not wanting to remedy problems.
Putin now acts just like that.
The conclusions from the Beslan drama are obvious.
Chechen policy must be revisited.
The security forces should be cleansed and disciplined.
Impotent ministers and governors should be sacked, while their offices should be given more authority.
More open information flows and fewer KGB appointees are needed.
Putin, however, wants nothing of the kind.
He does not obey the elementary rule that when in a hole, you stop digging.
None of the culprits has been sacked, while the editor of Izvestiya was sacked as a punishment for accurate reporting.
Nothing is done against the rampant corruption of the FSB.
Rather than give governors more authority, he demanded to appoint them himself.
Putin's rule is not only authoritarian; it is dysfunctional.
It is too rigid and centralized to handle crises.
Rather than address actual problems, Putin pursues his personal authoritarian agenda.
This centralized police state is interested in little but its own economic and political power.
It is difficult to escape the impression that Putin is more interested in pampering his KGB men than fighting terrorism.
Because liberal economic reforms harm their interests, such reforms have been abandoned.
The Orange Velvet Revolution
Ukraine's ‘Orange Revolution' will reach its climax on December 26, when Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovich and former Prime Minister Viktor Yushchenko will replay their run-off for the presidency.
The massive fraud that was supposed to bring victory to Mr Yanukovich, and which incited hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians to take to the streets of Kyiv to defent their rights, no longer looks possible.
Yet Ukraine's democratic future is still not guaranteed.
Ukraine is undergoing a true liberal revolution, akin to the great European liberal revolutions of 1848, and reminiscent of Prague's Velvet revolution of 1989. Ukrainians demand democracy, freedom and the rule of law.
After five years of an average annual economic growth of 9%, economic claims are strikingly absent, as are all socialist and even social demands.
The discredited election results suggested that the country is geographically and ethnically divided, with the democratic opposition candidate Yushchenko winning overwhelmingly in seventeen western and central regions, while Yanukovich dominated in ten eastern and southern regions.
However, Yushchenko did carry several Russian-speaking regions, notably the capital Kiev, and Yanukovich won most in the authoritarian Donetsk and Luhansk regions furthest to the east.
Much of the regional differences can be explained by their degree of democracy and openness rather than ethnicity.
Wisely, Yushchenko launched the slogan "East and West together!" emphasizing his endeavor to unite the country. Similarly, miners bussed by their managers to Kiev were soon being convinced of the ‘Orange' cause by the demonstrators and were quickly sent back East by their minders.
The role of business is palpable on both sides.
A quip says this is a revolt of the millionaires against the billionaires.
The Yanukovich candidacy was supported by the three dominant business clans with rather few allies, while the business community, and even some billionaires, overwhelmingly supported Yushchenko.
This is a truly bourgeois revolution.
Both the Ukrainian revolution and high economic growth have been caused by President Leonid Kuchma's patent habit of playing everybody against everybody, while abstaining from fair play.
Ordinary Ukrainians aspire to law and order; businessmen want their playing field to be leveled with the richest and most well connected.
Yushchenko is careful not to criticize oligarchs but "bandits" and corruption, because smaller oligarchs support him.
Rarely has one country intervened so heavily in another country's elections as Russia did here. Yushchenko's campaign alleges that Russian enterprises were forced by the Kremlin to put up $300 million for the Yanukovich campaign.
Kyiv and its airwaves were flooded with Russian political advisors, slandering Yushchenko worse than any Ukrainian did. President Putin himself campaigned twice for Yanukovich in Ukraine and congratulated him twice before the forged final results had been presented, rendering him little but ridiculous.
Russia's extreme activism is curious.
Yanukovich stands for a truly oligarchic state of the sort Putin defeated at home, and Yanukovich accused Yushchenko of having sold Ukrainian companies to Russian corporations.
President Putin's behavior is probably best explained by his dislike for democracy.
In addition, if Ukraine's President becomes an international pariah, he can only turn to Russia, as is the case of President Aleksandr Lukashenko in Belarus.
After this spectacular Russian failure, however, Putin's "managed democracy" looks anachronistic and faces the threat of a real democracy in its neighbor spreading to Russia.
For the first time, Ukrainians have thrown their little-brother complex toward the Russians overboard.
With new self-confidence, they note that they are thinking and facing the truth unlike their Russian brethren.
Ukraine has little choice but to turn to Europe and the West.
Ukrainian exports of steel have boomed on China's appetite, but sooner or later that appetite will be sated, and Ukrainian steel producers will need new markets.
Europe is the obvious choice, while Russia has little but stiff competition to offer.
If Ukraine becomes a democracy, it will undoubtedly soon develop the rule of law.
It is already a market economy and it is certainly located in Europe.
Thus, it becomes a formidable challenge to the European Union to offer anything but welcome to Ukraine.
Yet much can still go wrong.
The most obvious risk is that the elections are not concluded or that Yushchenko is denied executive power.
Solidarity suffered that frustration in Poland in 1980-81, which prolonged communist rule for a decade.
Fortunately for Ukraine, its business is private, and a common view of the whole business community is that the electoral rerun must be conclusive.
Otherwise, financial destabilization will threaten the fortunes of the very rich.
Another danger lies in the prominent role in the revolution of multi-millionaires.
No doubt they want to dominate the new cabinet, and with their impressive executive and intellectual skills they are dispersed over all parties.
Alas, if they are allowed to run the show, Ukraine might face more redistribution of fortunes than cleansing of corruption, letting the revolutionary public down.
Ideally, Yushchenko should reach out to the new professionals who have not as yet been intoxicated by the pervasive corruption of the old administration.
Nor has the old regime disappeared.
Yushchenko has gained a majority in Parliament because many adherents of the old regime switched their allegiance out of convenience.
They can change again, and no less than 300 of the 450 members of the Ukrainian Parliament are supposed to be millionaires.
Ukraine needs early parliamentary elections, but that is constitutionally difficult to accomplish.
Meanwhile, Yushchenko was forced to accept a poorly designed political reform full of traps. The Russian threat lingers, whereas the West is more likely than not to be too passive.
Fortunately, Yushchenko's camp is painfully aware that time is short and that they must act fast. Ukraine has a great opportunity, but its leaders must act radically to exploit it.
Lucky Putin, Unlucky Yeltsin
But Russia's stellar economic performance has little to do with Putin's policy, and a lot to do with the reforms Yeltsin embraced.
By 1998, Russia already had achieved a critical mass of markets and private enterprise, while the financial crash of that year worked like a catharsis, forcing the government to abolish enterprise subsidies that underpinned a devastating budget deficit of some 9% of GDP.
Moreover, world oil prices that had fallen to $10 a barrel started rising toward the stratosphere.
The whole success story thus was in place in early 1999, one year before Putin entered the stage.
To be sure, Putin should be praised for substantial economic reforms during his first three years.
A new tax code was adopted, with lower and fewer taxes, notably a flat income tax of 13%.
The civil code was completed, a new customs code was enacted, and substantial judicial reform was implemented.
At the same time, however, Putin has systematically eliminated the rudimentary democracy Yeltsin had build.
One television channel after another was taken over by the state under various pretexts, as were major newspapers.
Opposition candidates and parties were denied registration for the slightest formal complaint.
Falsification of elections became the rule.
Many prominent Russians favored the Pinochet model of authoritarian politics and liberal economics.
But growing authoritarianism also hit business.
In October 2003, Putin cracked down on Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the CEO and main owner of Yukos oil, Russia's most valuable company, who was thrown into prison on dubious charges of tax fraud after backing Putin's political opponents.
Moreover, Putin's associates wanted Yukos' wealth, which was confiscated by the state oil company Rosneft through lawless taxation, leaving Putin's tax reform and judicial reform in tatters and severely undermining property rights.
In fact, since 2003, Putin's main economic policy has been re-nationalization.
Well-run private companies have been more or less forced to sell out to state-dominated companies.
Gazprom is buying up oil (Sibneft), gas, and power companies at knockdown prices, reinforcing its monopoly.
That, in turn, allows Gazprom to boost its profitability through price increases, despite stagnant production.
Indeed, with state companies now producing one-third of Russia's oil, output growth has plummeted, as owners of private enterprises -- the source of dynamism in the sector -- are now afraid to invest in new capacity.
Among foreign investors, both Shell and TNK-BP are being pushed out by Gazprom in their main gas fields in Russia.
Beyond oil and gas, Russia's arms export agency, Rosoboronexport, has just seized Avtovaz, the giant dysfunctional Soviet car factory, and VSMPO-Avisma, Russia's big titanium company, while all aircraft production has been concentrated in one state company.
The government cheers this re-nationalization, although it has reduced Russia's industrial growth from 8.3% in 2004 to 4% in the last two years.
Similarly, inefficient state banks -- far inferior to private banks even in Kazakhstan or Ukraine -- dominate the banking system.
The not very profitable state-owned Vneshtorgbank, for example, is on a buying spree, aggravating the quality of Russian banking.
Increasingly, Russia's oil surpluses drive economic growth through rising investment, which boosts construction and consumption, in turn benefiting retail trade and finance.
With personal incomes rising strongly, poverty is declining, while 68% of Russia's college-age youth now attend universities.
But other social indicators are unimpressive.
Life expectancy for men is stuck at 59.
The murder rate is even higher under Putin than it was under Yeltsin, as is the traffic death rate.
None of the big public systems -- education, health care, or the military -- has been reformed, and the regime shows little interest in doing so.
Instead, the Kremlin is preoccupied with the profitability and value of the state-dominated companies that it controls.
Not surprisingly, all corruption indicators have been rising since Putin took over from Yeltsin, whereas they are falling in most post-communist countries.
Although corruption is pervasive, no top official has been prosecuted.
Putin and his KGB friends from St. Petersburg sit safely on all this wealth, thanks to their authoritarian governance and control over all security organs.
Such a powerful apparatus cannot retire to a quiet life in a dacha as Yeltsin did -- it would have to privatize everything first -- which implies that Putin has no choice but to remain in office, regardless of what he says about not seeking a third presidential term.
But if he holds on to power contrary to the constitution, his popularity could easily collapse, especially as his economic policy has thrived on luck, not reform.
Putinomics
The strangest thing about the Duma election was that Putin lost his nerve.
He over-exposed himself in public appearances that were as aggressive as they were vague in substance.
He ran against the West and the "chaos" of the 1990's, just as he raged against Chechen terrorists in 1999 and against oligarchs in 2003.
The Kremlin abandoned democratic procedures, controlling which parties were allowed to run and their candidates, while Putin's United Russia monopolized media coverage.
Opposition activists were blocked from most campaigning, and often arrested, while Kremlin-controlled courts denied their complaints.
People were intimidated into voting for United Russia on a mass scale.
Independent election monitors were barred.
As a consequence, the new State Duma has not been elected so much as appointed.
It lacks legitimacy and its members are unknown.
But Putin's legitimacy has also been tainted by the pervasive fraud.
His only "mass" meeting in Moscow drew no more than 5,000 people.
The main questions are how authoritarian he will become, or whether this pathetic campaign will weaken him.
Putin's policy is easy to understand if one realizes that he usually does the opposite of what he says.
In his first term, Putin appeared to be an authoritarian reformer, undertaking substantial market reforms, such as introducing a 13% flat income tax.
But in his second term, Putin was simply authoritarian, undertaking no economic or social reforms worth mentioning.
The expropriation of the oil company Yukos, valued at $100 billion, was the signal event, and was followed by rising corruption.
Putin has established a purely personal dictatorship.
He rules through the presidential administration and competing secret police forces without ideology or party.
United Russia is little more than a bunch of state officials.
He has sapped most power from other state institutions.
Personal authoritarianism rarely survives its founder.
Since Putin has created an over-centralized regime that cannot survive without him, he has to stay as president.
Law is of minimal relevance, as he can always order the Constitutional Court to approve his third term.
Putin's regime may be described as a group of clans, consisting of state-dominated corporations, such as Gazprom, Rosneft, Vneshtorgbank, Rosoboronexport, and the Russian Railways, together with the security agencies.
Putin's KGB cronies, usually from St. Petersburg, control these institutions, and tap them for huge kickbacks.
At the same time, Putin has made sure that they all hate one another, so that they need him as arbitrator or godfather.
In a sensational interview before the election in the Russian newspaper Kommersant , one of these previously unknown KGB managers explained how they use state extortion against private enterprises to accomplish their "velvet re-privatization" through state corporate raiding.
According to the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the share of GDP originating in the private sector has declined from 70% to 65% under Putin.
Re-nationalization through extortion is likely to accelerate.
This re-nationalization has not been justified ideologically, but rather cynically: the purpose is simply to generate corrupt revenues for top Kremlin officials.
Although corruption has been declining in most of the former Soviet Union, it has surged in Russia since 2004, becoming more rationalized and concentrated.
None of Putin's KGB kingpins has been arrested or even demoted.
As re-nationalization gained momentum, the public economic rhetoric changed and become statist.
Putin now favors protectionism, state intervention, and subsidies.
In this climate, no progressive structural reforms are likely.
Until recently, Russia has pursued an admirably conservative macroeconomic policy, running up huge budget and current account surpluses.
It has paid off its foreign debt and built up foreign currency reserves of $450 billion.
Before the Duma election, however, Putin jeopardized this last vestige of responsible economic policy.
Currently, Russia's greatest economic concern is growing inflationary pressure, driven especially by food prices.
Rising food prices are an international phenomenon, and Russia's inflation is driven by the large current account surpluses and capital inflows.
But Russia's government is no longer trying to mitigate these factors, instead pursuing an inflationary policy.
Monetary policy has been loose for the last year, and before the Duma election the government started pouring huge sums into pensions and other social welfare transfers.
Not surprisingly, inflation has shot up from 7% last spring to 11% currently, and may reach 15% in the spring.
Naturally, monetary and fiscal policy should be tightened, but that is difficult when Putin is trying to placate the population.
He could liberalize the exchange rate and let it float upwards, but he is not even doing that.
Instead, using an old Soviet tactic, Putin has imposed informal price controls, which cannot hold for long in a privatized economy.
Russia's economic growth is still driven by the sound market reforms undertaken in the 1990's and Putin's first term, together with high oil and gas prices.
But, while growth is not likely to stop any time soon, Russia's economic success increasingly hinges not only on high but rising oil and gas prices.
The main question about economic policy in Putin's third term, then, is how fast it will deteriorate.
Putin's Last Stand
The two biggest issues in Bucharest will be whether to invite Albania, Croatia, and Macedonia to join NATO, and whether to offer applications to Ukraine and Georgia to start so-called "membership action plans."
These questions should be decided by NATO's members, not outsiders.
In February 2007, Putin, in an anti-Western tirade delivered in Munich, declared: "I think it is obvious that NATO expansion does not have any relation with the modernization of the Alliance itself or with ensuring security in Europe.
On the contrary, it represents a serious provocation that reduces the level of mutual trust."
So Putin's views about NATO are clear.
He will scandalize the summit by seeking to intimidate the former Soviet clients in the room.
Such an aggressive attitude benefits a country's foreign policy only up to a point -- one that Putin passed long ago.
Initially, he acted as an able diplomat and accommodator, but since his Munich speech, Putin has begun uniting the West against Russia.
In his speech on May 9, 2007, commemorating Russia's victory in World War II, Putin compared the United States with Nazi Germany: "We have a duty to remember that the causes of any war lie above all in the mistakes and miscalculations of peacetime, and that these causes have their roots in an ideology of confrontation and extremism.
It is all the more important that we remember this today, because these threats are not becoming fewer, but are only transforming and changing their appearance.
These new threats, just as under the Third Reich, show the same contempt for human life and the same aspiration to establish an exclusive dictate over the world."
Serious politicians do not speak like that.
These are the rants of Putin's few remaining friends -- Venezuela's Hugo Chavez, Iran's Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, and Belarus's Alyaksandr Lukashenka.
At home, awareness is rising that Putin is damaging Russia's interests by insulting and intimidating everybody.
He is isolating his country among the world's pariahs; worse yet, he has achieved little.
When Putin became president in 2000, he named accession to the World Trade Organization as his foreign policy priority.
He failed, because he gave in to petty protectionist interests, imposing a timber embargo against Finland and Sweden, a fish embargo against Norway, and various agricultural embargos against Lithuania, Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia, and others.
Russia's foreign policy is focused on the interests of its state-dominated corporations, notably Gazprom, which has concluded agreements with many foreign countries and companies for monopolistic deliveries.
But a Gazprom pipeline typically costs three times as much per kilometer as a similar Western pipeline, because of "leakage" (kickbacks and waste).
The primary purpose of Russia's foreign policy seems to be to tap Russia's state companies for the benefit of Kremlin officials.
But customers do not trust suppliers who cut deliveries, raise prices unpredictably, expropriate competitors, and let production decrease in the way Gazprom and Russia's other state companies have done.
As a result, Russia's gas exports to Europe have started declining.
Putin's foreign policy also is evidently intended to whip up populist chauvinism.
Beating up on foreigners may boost his authoritarian rule, but this, too, has a price.
Not only the US and Europe, but all former Soviet republics feel alienated by Putin's aggressive tactics.
Many are seeking to shield themselves from Russia's capricious embargos -- for example, by seeking alternative energy supplies.
Arguably, Russia has improved its relations with China under Putin, but at the cost of acceding to China's demands for two big disputed islands over which the two countries fought in 1969.
Putin's apparent aim was to secure financing for Rosneft's purchase of the Yugansk oil field, which was part of the Yukos confiscation.
Yet China, too, is wary of Putin, and has been sending warm signals to leaders of former Soviet republics, such as Ukraine's Yuliya Tymoshenko.
Russia's nationalists are also outraged by Putin's foreign policy, because it has alienated former Soviet republics and weakened Russia's military.
The nationalist Council for National Strategy published a devastating report on the decay of Russia's military under Putin.
Russian military procurement, it claims, has plummeted.
For example, only three new military aircraft have been purchased since 2000.
True, armaments costs have risen sharply, but only because Putin's KGB friends, who monopolize weapons production, have stolen inordinate amounts.
Yet, despite this spending shortfall, Putin seems obsessed with making pointless and provocative gestures, such as resuming long-range nuclear bomber flights off the American coast.
In the early 1990's, many westerners and Russians wanted Russia to become a full-fledged member of both the European Union and NATO, on the condition that Russia became a full-fledged democracy.
Unfortunately, the West never made that offer, and Russian democracy went astray.
Russia should be given a new chance, but only after Putin has departed.
Russia is no enemy of the West; Vladimir Putin is.
Ukraine's Dollar Addiction
Ukraine's prices started spiraling out of control around the time when Yuliya Tymoshenko returned as prime minister last December.
Malicious observers suggest that she is to blame for pursuing populist social expenditures.
But this is false.
Her government actually tightened the budget just before New Year.
Indeed, Finance Minister Viktor Pynzenyk reports that the state recorded a budget surplus of 0.6% of GDP during the first quarter of 2008.
This is not surprising, because state revenues expand with rising prices, while expenditures are largely fixed.
But Tymoshenko's government has, in reality, done a solid fiscal job.
State finances are generally in good shape, with public debt at just 11% of GDP.
According to the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU), international reserves have grown steadily and now stand at $33 billion.
The real cause of Ukraine's inflation is that its currency, the hryvnia, remains pegged to the US dollar.
When the dollar falls in value, as it has, Ukraine's very open economy imports inflation.
In the last year, the dollar's value dropped by 12% against the euro, which is a more important currency than the dollar in Ukraine's foreign trade.
The International Monetary Fund has persistently warned Ukraine that its dollar peg could cause a financial crisis because of over- or undervaluation, and for years has called on Ukraine to free its exchange rate.
But the NBU refused to do so -- making Ukraine the last country in Central and Eastern Europe to tie its currency to the dollar.
Ukraine's powerful industrialists praised the NBU's low exchange-rate policy, believing it makes the country more competitive.
They ignore the fact that the NBU can control only the nominal appreciation of the hryvnia.
But costs are determined by the real revaluation, which is the sum of exchange-rate changes and inflation.
The dollar peg has also forced the NBU to pursue a loose monetary policy.
Ukraine's current refinance rate is 16% a year, 10% less than inflation, which means that Ukraine has a negative real interest rate of 10% a year.
As a result, Ukraine's money supply, M3, exploded by no less than 52% in the last year, which points to inflation hitting 30% soon.
The NBU's leadership understands that it must act to contain inflation, but its insistence on the dollar peg ties their hands, because it prevents them from raising interest rates sufficiently.
Instead, they have reverted to strict reserve requirements, effectively rationing credit and thereby causing a domestic credit squeeze in the midst of the current international financial crisis, which is likely to force some medium-sized banks into bankruptcy because of liquidity problems.
Rationing is always worse than a market.
Why does the NBU persist with this harmful policy?
Incompetence is one reason, but politics is probably the decisive cause.
The NBU is subordinate to President Viktor Yushchenko, who, despite naming Tymoshenko as prime minister, seems more interested in harming her politically than in capping inflation.
The flaws in the NBU's policy are so obvious it will be forced to free the exchange rate, but it might act too late.
Even now, in the midst of an inflationary crisis, the NBU wants to move in small steps, evidently failing to grasp the severity of the crisis.
The NBU needs to announce that it no longer has an exchange-rate target and that it will stop intervening by ending its purchases of dollars on the currency market.
If the NBU lets the exchange rate float, Ukrainians are likely to exchange billions of dollars into hryvnia, driving up the hryvnia exchange rate.
That would contain Ukraine's inflation, as the NBU could restrict the money supply through high interest rates rather than rationing.
Time is short.
The great economist Rudi Dornbusch used to say that a financial crisis usually starts much later than anyone expects, but then develops faster than anyone can imagine.
Ukraine is on the financial precipice.
Yushchenko and the NBU can still act, but if they do not do so immediately, a costly and unnecessary financial crisis might ensue.
As prime minister, Yushchenko saved his country from financial default in early 2000.
Ukraine's well-being must not be sacrificed to his political ambitions.
The Return of the Siloviki
Putin's statement hit like a bolt from the blue.
Two days earlier, United States Trade Representative Ron Kirk and European Union Trade Commissioner Catherine Ashton had completed successful talks on Russia's accession to the WTO with Putin's first deputy, Igor Shuvalov, Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin, and Minister of Economy and Development Elvira Nabiullina.
As late as June 3, Putin had declared himself sure of Russia's "swift joining of the WTO."
The leaders of Belarus or Kazakhstan seemed equally surprised by Putin's statement, especially as Russia had just prohibited almost all imports of dairy products from Belarus in a protectionist ploy.
After 16 years of negotiations, Russia appeared poised to join the WTO within a couple of months.
Indeed, only three difficult hurdles remained.
First, Ukraine demands a bilateral protocol on market access, which would force Russia to abolish roughly 100 trade sanctions, primarily in agriculture.
The second obstacle is border controls with Georgia, a mainly political issue: whether Abkhazia and South Ossetia are independent, as Russia maintains, or are part Georgia, as the rest of the world believes.
Finally, the EU insists that Russia abolish planned prohibitive export tariffs on lumber.
Only the Georgian issue is really serious.
A customs union with Belarus and Kazakhstan is no alternative to Russia's WTO accession.
No countries have ever entered the WTO collectively, nor is this legally possible says WTO head Pascal Lamy.
Moreover, while the customs union was proclaimed in 1995, the earliest it can be formed is in July 2011, which is unlikely.
Predominantly a commodity exporter, Russia has less need for the WTO than a manufacturer like China.
Even so, one-fifth of Russia's exports comprise metals and chemicals that are sensitive to anti-dumping measures.
A series of World Bank and Russian studies have estimated that Russia can gain 0.5-1.0 percentage points in economic growth for half a decade if it joins the WTO.
Membership is also important for Russia's international standing.
It is the only G-20 country outside of the WTO, which accounts for 96% of global trade.
The WTO also represents a choice of economic and political strategy.
Before Putin resigned as president in May 2008, he presented his "Russia 2020" program.
Its heart was an "innovation strategy" based on more market reforms and investment in human capital, leading to annual growth of 6-7%.
In their rhetoric, President Dmitri Medvedev and his technocrats embrace this vision.
But Putin and his siloviki (political allies whose power base is in the security apparatus) seem to prefer an "inertia strategy," the worst of the Russia 2020 scenarios.
This strategy amounts to state capitalism, living on Russia's energy wealth, and doing nothing to curtail Russia's massive red tape and corruption.
By reversing course on the WTO, Putin has again shown himself to be Russia's master.
He did the same thing last summer by lashing out against a successful mining and metallurgical company, Mechel, and provoking the war in Georgia.
During the winter, Putin's poor policy choices on the financial crisis undermined his power.
Rather than shielding Russia's private enterprises, he engineered a domestic liquidity freeze, which led to a sharp drop in GDP of 9.5% in the first quarter of 2009, despite Russia's huge foreign reserves.
The pragmatic technocrats took over, but the subsequent doubling of oil prices signals that the danger for Russia's economy is over for now, so the siloviki are resuming command.
The question is what their next step will be.
The prominent Russian military analyst Pavel Felgenhauer insists that their prime aim is to finish off Georgia and its president, Mikheil Saakashvili, who remains in power and defiant.
Georgia has received no military support and is virtually undefended.
The Kremlin continues its propaganda offensive against Georgia, and has vetoed prolonging the mandate for United Nations observers in Georgia and Abkhazia.
A major Russian military maneuver, Caucasus 2009, is underway.
The last such maneuver, Caucasus 2008, was followed by the invasion of Georgia.
During the latter part of this maneuver, July 6-8, US President Barack Obama is supposed to meet President Medvedev in Moscow.
Medvedev obviously hopes to reach out and improve Russia's and his own standing in the world. The siloviki , however, prefer Russia isolated and authoritarian, with power securely in their hands.
The Kremlin wants a new strategic arms control agreement, but the siloviki desire nothing more.
Obama's administration had hoped for a final breakthrough in Russia's WTO talks, but Putin's actions have eliminated prospects for such an outcome.
The US also wants progress on the territorial integrity of former Soviet states, such as Georgia, but that, too, is unlikely.
Putin or his collaborators seem to be setting up Medvedev for a failure, suggesting that their jealousy of Medvedev's limited power is greater than their interest in defending Russia's national interests.
Yet there is still hope that Putin encounters a sufficiently negative reaction that he changes his stance on WTO accession.
After all, he suspended Russia's WTO accession talks after the August 2008 war in Georgia, only to allow them to restart this spring.
Westernize the Black Sea Region
The bloody end to the schoolhouse hostage crisis in North Ossetia, and recent clashes in Georgia between government troops and separatist forces, have put the troubled Black Sea region on the front pages of newspapers once again.
This rising violence is also a wake-up call for the West, highlighting the need for a new Euro-Atlantic strategy in a vitally important region that lies at the crossroads of Europe, Eurasia, and the Middle East.
Indeed, the Black Sea region is the Euro-Atlantic community's eastern frontier with the wider Middle East.
With Afghanistan, Iraq, and Iran topping the list of strategic challenges facing the West, anchoring democracy and security in these new borderlands of the Euro-Atlantic community has become imperative for both the United States and the EU.
Moreover, success here can provide lessons in how to facilitate the daunting process of reform and modernization in the wider Middle East.
Georgia's "Rose Revolution" last winter demonstrated that the will to implement radical reform now exists.
For the first time, a country in the region is matching its aspirations with the concrete steps needed to become a viable candidate for eventual membership in Euro-Atlantic institutions.
A visitor to Georgia's capital, Tbilisi, now sees the same level of determination to join the West that existed a decade ago in the Baltic states.
America and Europe share an interest in the success of these efforts, particularly as they seek to diversify energy supplies away from Saudi Arabian and Persian Gulf oil.
The Black Sea is poised to become a key conduit for non-OPEC, non-Gulf oil and natural gas flowing into European markets and beyond.
The Black Sea region's long-term stability and integration with the West is thus critically important to the long-term energy security strategy of EU and NATO members.
Anchoring these countries to the West will not be easy.
Whether the end result is better relations or full integration of these countries into the EU and NATO is an open question.
But both organizations need to reach out to these countries, a process that should be seen as the next phase in completing the wider Europe.
What should a new bold yet realistic EU and NATO outreach strategy for the Black Sea region look like?
Clearly, the region's countries are weaker and further behind previous candidates for Western integration.
But the good news is that the EU and NATO are much better positioned to develop an ambitious strategy than they were vis-à-vis Central and Eastern Europe a decade ago.
If the EU and NATO decide to launch a bold outreach strategy for the region, they will be able to draw on existing tools, conceptual talent, and practical experience.
For example, NATO already has three members - Bulgaria, Romania, and Turkey - bordering the Black Sea.
As for the EU, the candidacies of Romania and Bulgaria need to be concluded successfully, together with the issue of Turkey's membership aspirations.
An EU that includes Sofia and Bucharest, and that is on track with Ankara, will be well positioned to engage the wider region.
The EU also needs to put meat on the bones of its new Neighborhood Policy, while NATO must apply new mechanisms for strengthening ties with the region.
As opposed to a 100- or 200-meter sprint, both organizations need to think more in terms of a much longer race, perhaps a marathon.
If countries in the region embrace the idea, a network of current EU and NATO members could step forward with projects and assistance aimed at promoting a Black Sea identity and community.
Recent events in Georgia remind us that resolving the region's "frozen conflicts"- i.e., those in the breakaway regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, of Transdneistria in Moldova, and Nagorno-Karabakh in Azerbaijan - must be a priority.
In reality, these conflicts are not frozen; they are festering wounds that breed corruption and organized crime. They inhibit democratization and incite instability.
While these conflicts involve historical grievances, outside actors - particularly Russia - contribute to their lack of resolution, which is essential for successful reform.
So far, neither America nor Europe has made these conflicts a top priority.
Resolving these semi-dormant wars requires stepped-up political involvement, economic engagement, and a willingness to provide Western peacekeeping forces and monitors if and when they are needed.
But the long-term peace and stability needed to advance economic and political reform in the region will also require either a change in Russian behavior or a reduction in Russian influence.
The experience of the last decade suggests that a policy of engaging the Kremlin intensely while protecting fundamental Western interests may be the best way to proceed.
Developing a new Euro-Atlantic strategy for the Black Sea region must start with the democracies of North America and Europe recognizing their moral and political stake in the outcome.
Projecting stability and security in these countries is the next logical step in building a Europe "whole and free" and securing the Euro-Atlantic community's eastern frontier with the Middle East.
This task will be as important over the next decade as integrating Central and Eastern Europe into the West was in the 1990's.
A Global Green New Deal
Far from burdening an already over-stressed, over-stretched global economy, environmental investments are exactly what is needed to get people back to work, get order books flowing, and assist in powering economies back to health.
In the past, concern for the environment was viewed as a luxury; today, it is a necessity -- a point grasped by some, but by no means all, economic architects yet.
A big slice of President Barack Obama's $825 billion stimulus package for the United States includes a boost to renewable energy, "weatherizing" a million homes, and upgrading the country's inefficient electricity grid.
Such investments could generate an estimated five million "green-collar" jobs, provide a shot in the arm for the construction and engineering industries, and get America back into the equally serious business of combating climate change and achieving energy security.
The Republic of Korea, which is losing jobs for the first time in more than five years, has also spotted the green lining to grim economic times.
President Lee Myung-Bak's government plans to invest $38 billion employing people to clean up four major rivers and reduce disaster risks by building embankments and water-treatment facilities.
Other elements of Lee's plan include construction of eco-friendly transportation networks, such as high-speed railways and hundreds of kilometers of bicycle tracks, and generating energy using waste methane from landfills.
The package also counts on investments in hybrid vehicle technologies.
Similar pro-employment "Green New Deal" packages have been lined up in China, Japan, and the United Kingdom.
They are equally relevant to developing economies in terms of jobs, fighting poverty, and creating new opportunities at a time of increasingly uncertain commodity prices and exports.
In South Africa, the government-backed Working for Water initiative -- which employs more than 30,000 people, including women, youth, and the disabled -- also sees opportunity in crisis.
The country spends roughly $60 million annually fighting invasive alien plants that threaten native wildlife, water supplies, important tourism destinations, and farmland.
This work is set to expand as more than 40 million tons of invasive alien plants are harvested for power-station fuel.
As a result, an estimated 500 megawatts of electricity, equal to 2% of the country's electricity needs, will be generated, along with more than 5,000 jobs.
So it is clear that some countries now view environmental investments in infrastructure, energy systems, and ecosystems as among the best bets for recovery.
Others may be unsure about the potential returns from investing in ecosystem services such as forest carbon storage or in renewable energy for the 80% of Africans who have no access to electricity.
Still others may simply be unaware of how to precisely follow suit.
In early February, the United Nations Environment Program will convene some of the world's leading economists at the UN's headquarters in New York.
A strategy for a Global Green New Deal, tailored to different national challenges, will be fleshed out in order to assist world leaders and ministers craft stimulus packages that work on multiple fronts.
The Global Green New Deal, which UNEP launched as a concept in October 2008, responds to the current economic malaise.
Spent wisely, however, these stimulus packages could trigger far-reaching and transformational trends, setting the stage for a more sustainable, urgently needed Green Economy for the twenty-first century.
The trillions of dollars that have been mobilized to address current woes, together with the trillions of investors' dollars waiting in the wings, represent an opportunity that was unthinkable only 12 months ago: the chance to steer a more resource-efficient and intelligent course that can address problems ranging from climate change and natural-resource scarcity to water shortages and biodiversity loss.
Blindly pumping the current bail-out billions into old industries and exhausted economic models will be throwing good money after bad while mortgaging our children's future.
Instead, political leaders must use these windfalls to invest in innovation, promote sustainable businesses, and encourage new patterns of decent, long-lasting employment.
Designer Diets?
Throughout our lives, we are exposed to a complex mixture of food compounds.
Intricate biochemical processes extract from food the energy and other useful components that enable us to grow and function.
Many compounds, seemingly unimportant in the past, are now recognized as influencing our health.
For example, lycopene from cooked tomato sauces may help prevent prostate cancer.
Everyone, indeed, knows that food can have a positive or negative impact on health.
Food may never cure any particular disease, but diets rich in fruits and vegetables, cereals and plant-sourced oils offer protection from many cancers, cardiovascular disease, and other illnesses associated with old age.
The problem, for scientists and consumers alike, is that the benefits are not the same for everyone.
So we need to understand how what we eat interacts with our bodies -- or, more specifically, our genes -- to affect our health.
This is the science of nutrigenomics.
The long-term aim of nutrigenomics is to define how the whole body responds to food using so called "systems biology."
Every cell in your body (except mature red blood cells) -- there are about 50 trillion in an adult -- contains copies of your DNA, which are coiled up tightly to form 46 separate bundles called chromosomes.
These chromosomes are stored in the core of the cell (nucleus), and there are 22 matching pairs, one of each pair from each of your biological parents, plus an X-chromosome from your mother and either an X- or Y-chromosome from your father; XX makes you a girl and XY a boy.
DNA stores information that is vital to the growth, repair, replacement, and correct functioning of our cells.
It consists of two strings -- formed from phosphate and sugar -- along which four unique chemical compounds (DNA bases) are attached.
There are about three billion bases, and the sequences in which they occur is our genetic code, or human genome.
Within the genetic code, there are 30,000-40,000 highly organized regions called genes.
Genes are the basic unit of heredity, and, unless you are an identical twin, the combination of genes inherited from your parents is unique to you.
The genes that you have make up your genotype.
The resulting product, for example eye color, is your phenotype.
Genotyping can be used to determine which genes you have, but it cannot always predict your phenotype.
The inheritance of some characteristics, including eye color, is simple.
The majority of phenotypes are, however, the product of complex multi-gene interaction, environment, and lifestyle choices.
This includes our risk of developing a host of age-related diseases.
Genes code for proteins, the body's workers, which are not made directly from DNA, because they do not speak the same language.
Ribonucleic acid (RNA) acts as an interpreter in a process called transcription (the reading of genes).
Translation from RNA creates three-dimensional proteins from combinations of 22 essential amino acids -- essential only because our bodies are not able to make them, so they must be obtained from our diet instead.
The proteins that are produced, their quantities, and their characteristics collectively form the proteome, and their activities, in combination or in response to signals from within the body or external to it, form our metabolism.
Such is the complexity of nutrigenomics that it is no longer possible for nutritional researchers to work alone.
Expertise in a wide variety of different areas -- molecular and cell biology, mathematics and statistics, nutrition and diet, food chemistry, and social science -- is fundamental to progress.
To this end, 22 leading groups have united to create The European Nutrigenomics Organization, or NuGO.
Funded by the European Commission, NuGO gives scientists from organizations that usually compete for funding and the best researchers their first real opportunity to work together.
Difficulties stemming from professional jargon, organizational structure, and distance are more than offset by the benefits of integrating nutrigenomics facilities and expertise to ensure cooperative use of knowledge and its application in nutritional research.
Nutrigenomics is not the Holy Grail of nutrition, but neither is it irrelevant to all but the worried-but-wealthy few that will be able to afford the new food products when they arrive.
Determining the structure of DNA and the sequence of the human genome has revolutionized biology and medicine.
It has created new specialties and advanced our understanding of disease.
But rarely does this knowledge allow us to control outcomes -- prevention rather than cure.
Indeed, in the twenty-first century, we still cannot describe health except in terms of the absence of disease.
Today's new technologies enable health to be identified in terms of patterns of gene expression, protein production, and metabolic response.
Applied to nutrition, nutrigenomics will allow us to understand, and perhaps more importantly, to manipulate our individual response to existing foods so as to benefit our health.
For some people, this will mean expensive genetic testing and designer diets, but for most, it will mean realistic advice based on visibly demonstrable phenotypes -- a tendency to gain weight, for example, or an intolerance or allergic response to certain food types.
Above all, nutrigenomics holds out the promise of providing the healthy independence that everyone hopes for in later years.
Barak the Healer
TEL AVIV: The landslide victory of the leader of the Labour Party, General Ehud Barak, in the May 17th elections in Israel means not only a new government and a new foreign policy.
It also signifies the beginning of a new era in Israeli political culture.
The three years (1996-9) of Benjamin Netanyahu's government were characterized by the politics of confrontation and animosity in all spheres of political life.
Former Prime Minister Netanyahu focused not only on a politics of confrontation with the Palestinian leadership under Yassir Arafat, but also cultivated a politics of internal confrontation - between religious and secular Jews, between "old timers" and newcomers from the former Soviet Union, between European and Middle Eastern Jews (Ashkenazi versus Sephardi).
This divide-to-rule policy was a way of life which characterized Mr. Netanyahu even before he became Prime Minister.
As leader of the nationalist Likud opposition to the governments of Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres, his tactics in opposing the Oslo agreements between the Labour led government of Israel and the PLO was to characterize both Mr. Rabin and Mr. Peres as traitors, the functional equivalents of such infamous collaborators as Petain and Quisling.
It was in this atmosphere of confrontation and hatred, nurtured by Mr. Netanyahu, that a right-wing nationalist religious Jewish student assassinated Prime Minister Rabin because he saw him as a traitor who, at Oslo, gave up parts of the historical homeland of the Jewish people to the "terrorist" Palestine Liberation Organization.
When he became Prime Minister in elections six months after the assassination of General Rabin, Mr. Netanyahu continued in this strategy of exclusion and confrontation.
The consequences have been a deep crisis in relations with the Palestinians, a cooling of relations between Israel and its great strategic partner, the United States, and an internal climate of deep divisions, ethnic tension and a vulgar coarsening of almost all political discourse.
Ehud Barak, the Labour leader, is made of different stuff.
Born on a kibbutz, he served most of his life in the Israeli army, became its Chief-of-Staff and also its most decorated soldier.
But like many Israeli military leaders - Rabin himself comes to mind - as a military man he is also a pragmatist, knowing the limits of power.
When he became the leader of the Labor party less than three years ago, he also developed a new style of politics: instead of confrontation, dialogue; instead of exclusion, the politics of inclusion.
General Barak won the election as head of a broad coalition led by his own Labour Party, but including also the Gesher Party, representing North African working-class Jewish immigrants as well as the Meimad movement, representing Orthodox Jews.
It was this coalition, based on the politics of inclusion, which gave Barak his impressive victory: while Netanyahu won the 1996 election by a margin of 0.5%, Barak won this time by a margin of about 10%.
Many Russian immigrants voted for the first time for a Labour candidate.
As Prime Minister, Mr Barak will have a difficult agenda before him: going back to the Oslo agreements, which signify the historical compromise between Israel and the PLO; negotiating a territorial agreement with the Palestinians which will have to balance between their legitimate rights and Israel's security concerns; not letting extremist terrorism derail a peace process which is supported by a large majority of both peoples; finding a mutually acceptable formula for the difficult problem of Jerusalem.
Negotiations with Syria have to be restarted. Internationally he will have to get the Israeli economy out of its current recession, a downturn that it was thrown into because of the deadlock of the peace process as well as the total mismanagement of the economy under Mr Netanyahu.
Prime Minister Barak will also have to be a healer: he will have to heal the wounds between Jews and Arabs, and between Jews and Jews.
It is not an easy task, and there are no quick fixes.
A lot of patience will be needed but now at least the political will to confront Israel's domestic divide, and its long divide with the Palestinians, is there.
Syrian Roulette
JERUSALEM: Parliamentary maneuvers in the Knesset and recent fighting in Lebanon put Syrian/Israeli peace talks in cold storage.
Even Israeli's unilateral pledge to pull its army out of south Lebanon this summer did not instantly rekindle them.
But these ups and downs only indicate the difficulties involved.
They also reflect the nature of the closed Syrian regime, which never underwent anything like a perestroika.
The most important new fact remains unchanged: after fifty years of enmity Syria has signaled its readiness to follow Egypt, Jordan and the PLO in seeking reconciliation with the Jewish state.
So even the Lion of Damascus ("Assad" means lion in Arabic), it appears, is no longer willing to isolate himself from changes in the region.
Three causes push President Hafez al-Assad, ever so glacially, towards accepting the necessity of peace with Israel.
First, disappearance of the Soviet bloc deprived Damascus of its Moscow-based strategic umbrella: if Syria finds itself at war with Israel and loses, as in the past, hundreds of tanks and aircraft, there will be no automatic resupply from Moscow.
In short: Syria has no military option.
Secondly, Syria does not like feeling isolated -- neither in the Arab world, nor on the international scene.
With Egypt, Jordan and the Palestinians at peace with Israel, the idea of being in the same category as Baghdad and Tripoli does not appeal to Assad.
Moreover, all Arab regimes that made peace with Israel benefit from improved relations with the United States (i.e.: economic assistance), while Syria remains on the American list of terrorist states.
Here again the disappearance of Soviet power brings our Syria's vulnerability.
When even Assad's allies in Teheran talk about a "dialogue of civilizations" with the West, the chill felt in Damascus must be great.
Last and not least: although President Assad has been ailing for years, he has outlived most of his neighbors. There is no doubt that the Assad era is coming to a close.
He is grooming his son Bishar to succeed him.
Alliance between the three pillars of the regime -- the Army, the Ba'ath Party and the Alawite clans -- seems capable of guaranteeing a smooth transition.
What better gift can Assad-pére bequeath to his son than a return of the Golan Heights.
These developments have their mirror image in Israel and suggest why the Labour-led governments of Rabin, Peres and now Barak are ready for meaningful compromise on the territorial issue of the Golan.
The strategic importance of the dramatic heights, overlooking most of the northern Israeli region of Galilee, is obvious.
Because Syria, bereft of Soviet support, is less of a threat to Israel, Jerusalem can be more flexible than before, when the Golan was a glacis defending Israel not only against Syria, but against a bloc seemingly stretching all the way to Vladivostok.
So, despite today's interruptions, a context for negotiations exists, as well as political will on both sides.
The agendas of both parties are, however, different: while Syria focuses on the symbolic meaning of the return of the Golan, Israel wants specific, entrenched guarantees regarding the security of its northeastern border, as well as an end to Syrian-supported Hizbullah incursions from Lebanon -- a country that is virtually a Syrian protectorate.
For Israel the quid pro quo for returning the Golan is not a piece of paper with the usual phrases about peace and coexistence.
It needs tangible, institutionalized arrangements that will assure a skeptical Israeli public and make a return of hostilities difficult.
This means normalization of relations: mutual recognition, full diplomatic relations, exchange of ambassadors, open frontiers, free movement of people and goods, possibilities for economic and scientific cooperation -- plus an effective early warning system.
It is these steps, which may sound reasonable to outsiders, which create problems for the closed, claustrophobic, regime in Damascus.
Syria does not enjoy open relations with any of its other neighbors: the border with Iraq has been virtually closed for decades, the border with Turkey is contested.
What for Israel appears as "normalization" is totally abnormal for Syria.
A different obstacle appears on the Israeli side, where any territorial concessions must be ratified, according to a law passed in the waning days of the Netanyahu government (and recently toughened), by a referendum.
Israel has no experience with referenda, and having a peace treaty ratified by a referendum is in any case quite unique.
It is reasonable to argue that if agreement is reached with Syria and accepted by the government as well as a majority in the Knesset, it will eventually be ratified.
This is Barak's argument, and it seems plausible.
Yet, negotiating a complicated and painful agreement with Syria, which may involve uprooting 15,000 Israeli settlers from the Golan, under a Damocles' sword of a referendum doesn't make Barak's task easier.
Recent demonstrations in Tel-Aviv against returning the Golan marked the beginning of a campaign that will shadow the negotiations with ever greater force the more the negotiations seem capable of bearing fruit.
So both sides labor under complex conditions and in political contexts which make negotiations an almost Byzantine game.
Yet the political will on both sides is there, giving hope to a process which otherwise appears like squaring a circle.
Another European Failure
JERUSALEM: The European Union has failed once again.
Its total impotence to prevent war near the heart of Europe was amply proved in Bosnia and Kosovo over the last decade.
Now the European Union has once again failed to respond to the challenge posed by the Haider phenomenon in Austria.
By lifting the half-hearted sanctions imposed by the 14 members of the EU on Austria in February, any talk about Europe standing for a community of values sounds even more hollow than ever before.
In the case of Bosnia and Kosovo, Brussels proved itself to be totally irrelevant and impotent when the use of force -- or the threat of the use of force -- was concerned.
Fine words and mellifluous phrases filled many documents -- but when Vukovar was destroyed, Dubrovnik shelled, Sarajevo besieged for years and then the horrible mass murders in Srebrenica occurred -- all that the European Union was able to muster were more words and self-righteous indignation.
But then one could argue that the European Union was not a military alliance.
In the end, it proved that -- of all people -- Machiavelli was right when he argued that even prophets need to be armed in order to be effective: the moral imperative not to allow another genocide-like development in Europe needed the NATO's armaments to be effective.
The European Union continued to produce words.
When it came to Austria, however, there was a feeling that since this was not a military, but a purely political and moral situation, Brussels -- and the Continent-wide political clout signified by it -- would be able to prove efficient.
Alas, it failed as dismally as the League of Nations failed in the l930's.
Let us revisit what the issue was and still is: in the heart of Europe -- and in a country burdened by the political ideologies which gave rise to Hitler, himself an Austrian -- Jörg Haider and his party revived the political discourse of xenophobia, racism and visceral anti-foreign sentiment.
It is true that democracies always find it difficult to balance their commitment to human rights with their commitment to free speech: it is a delicate path to tread, and there is no easy answer on a legal and constitutional level.
Yet the issue is not legal or constitutional -- it is political.
To preserve democracy and human rights, democratic parties have realized that the most effective ways to confront racist and xenophobic parties is to marginalize and exclude them -- to treat them as beyond the pale as potential partners for government.
The Austrians are right that Haider-like parties exist in many European countries -- in Britain, France, even in some Scandinavian countries.
But in all these countries, the political discourse of all democratic parties ostracized these racist groups and parties: British Conservatives have never entered into an alliance with the British National Front; the same goes for France, where French conservatives have expelled from their own party local leaders who fashioned municipal alliances with Le Pen's representatives.
This is exactly what the Austrian conservative People's Party under Wolfgang Schuessel did not do.
Confronted with an election outcome of whether to rejoin the Social Democrats or Haider's Freedom Party, they made a Faustian pact with Haider.
There may be good political reasons why another alliance with the Social Democrats was not appealing to Schuessel's party (for one, he would not be Chancellor in such a coalition).
But there are basic values which should have overruled such purely tactical considerations and have prevented Schuessel's party from joining with Haider.
It is the moral blindness of Schuessel and his party that triggered the response of the 14 members of the EU.
One could argue that the bilateral sanctions imposed by the 14 on Austria were inadequate and even ineffective.
This is besides the point: the point is, what is the European Union, committed to democracy and human rights, going to do now?
Let us put it bluntly: the continued participation of Haider's party in a governing coalition in a European country is totally unacceptable.
The language Haider and many leaders of his party have used over the years is informed by the same racist and anti-Semitic discourse that gave birth to Nazism: in the specific Austrian context, it is violently anti-Slav as well as anti-Turkish.
While Haider is careful not to say anything which can be construed as anti-Semitic, his praise for the valor and honor of Waffen-SS veterans as well as comments on Nazi concentration camps clearly suggest where his ideological home is.
Haider and his party deserve to be politically isolated and ostracized.
The EU countries have failed twice in their attempt to respond to this challenge -- once by half-hearted sanctions; now by lifting them.
What is Brussels to do?
Continue with business-as-usual, churning out document upon document of bureaucratic mumbo-jumbo, perhaps even continue to give free advice to Israelis and Palestinians about how to work out their differences?
One wonders what a good European word for chutzpa would be.
Charity begins at home.
At a time when the EU is on the verge of an ambitious project of enlargement to include many Slav and other Eastern European nations, to allow a racist and xenophobic party to be in power in Austria -- or anywhere else within the EU -- is a continued reminder of the moral bankruptcy of the idea of European unification.
After the l930's and l940's one would have hoped that European countries would take threats emanating from a kind of language and sentiment expressed by Haider and his party more seriously.
This is the challenge for European leaders now, and one would hope that under the French Presidency, and with the traditions of the Enlightenment being so central to French and European discourse, a vigorous, efficient response will be found.
No War of Civilizations
More to the point, this is not a new war.
Terrorism has existed as a political tool in the Middle East for a long time -- and it has been used not only against Israel or the United States.
It was Syrian agents who assassinated Lebanon's President-elect Beshir Gemayel in 1982.
Kurdish terrorists have been active in Turkey for decades; Islamic terrorists assassinated President Anwar Sadat in l981 and later tried to assassinate President Mubarak.
This is not a fight against Western imperialism or globalization.
Nor is it a response to the present violent deadlock in the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations: some of Osama bin Laden's terrorist acts against American targets in the mid-1990's, it should be recalled, occurred at the height of the Israeli-Palestinian honeymoon that followed the Oslo agreements of l993.
Instead, we are witnessing a much deeper phenomenon, which is as much cultural as political and economic.
Islam as a religion can be tolerant as well as triumphalist -- as its sister world religion, Christianity, can be.
But there is a strain in extremist Islam that sees modernity -- the whole Enlightenment project -- as its enemy.
For it democracy, equality, political liberalism, separation of state and church, equality between the sexes, secularism -- are all the work of the Devil.
Just like the Anabaptists of Münster, they see themselves as God's agents in a world corrupted by the sins of materialism and faithlessness.
Such a Manichaean world legitimizes terrorism as the will of God. For people like Bin Laden -- and it appears that it is his version of Islamic fundamentalism which is behind the terror acts in New York and Washington -- even the Saudi monarchy is evil, because it has facilitated American presence in the Middle East.
For years, some versions of such terrorism have received tacit support from some Arab states.
Even some European countries, for causes deeply rooted in a Machiavellian raison d'etat , have sometimes closed their eyes when confronted with terrorist behavior.
Syria -- a prime source of state-sponsored terrorism -- is now even considered a candidate for a seat in the Security Council.
But just as there could be no moral neutrality in the war against Nazism and Fascism, so the coalition the Americans are now trying to build will begin to take as a root assumption that, if the war against terrorism is to be serious, tolerance of terror-supporting regimes cannot go on.
Some terrorists are, no doubt, motivated by legitimate concerns and have legitimate grievances (the Kurds and the Palestinians come to mind).
Yet legitimate goals do not legitimize evil means.
The kind of terrorism which we saw in the l970's and l980's -- airline hijacking, the murder of Israeli athletes in the l972 Munich Olympics -- has now mutated into the Islam-inspired Palestinian suicide terrorist, and finally into the Armageddon-like landscape we now see in New York and Washington.
The war ahead will be a difficult one.
The war against Iraq of a decade ago, and the "virtual" war without casualties that NATO waged in the skies over Kosovo, offer no precedents.
Indeed, they deluded us for too long into thinking that the war against terrorism was a police matter -- that investigators and indictments were the way to fight fanatical terrorists, not a relentless, painstaking armed struggle.
Those delusions, at long last, ended brutally with the massacres in New York and Washington.
No clear strategies now exist for how the war is to be waged.
Strategies, however, will be found.
What would be a tragic is if this struggle against terror became a war of civilizations, of the West against Islam.
For the terrorist vision of Islam is a perversion of it.
But collaborators with terrorism should, and will likely be viewed with the same severity as the terrorists themselves.
Only in this way can this war against the world of the Enlightenment, which is the modern world that stretches across all the oceans and, yes, embraces all its faiths, be won.
How to Target Iraq
In the current debate about policy towards Iraq, two extreme alternatives are usually presented: either extend the military campaign against terrorism to Iraq, or maintain the current uneasy status quo with that country.
Pious talk about reworking the UN sanctions is another version of the second alternative - that is, of doing nothing.
Both alternatives are unpalatable.
Yet preparing a ground war against Iraq - finishing off the unfinished business of the 1991 Gulf War - is a high risk strategy.
Arab countries, already questionable allies in the war against fellow Muslims in Afghanistan, will be even less reliable in a war against fellow Arabs.
The Europeans, let alone the Russians, may demure.
The military odds appear daunting.
Still, letting the status quo continue is equally problematic.
It means that the Iraqi people will continue to suffer - both from Saddam's brutalities, as well as from the consequences of the sanctions caused by his continued rule.
Moreover, it would continue to send the wrong message to would-be terrorists: you can get away with murder.
The perceived weakness of the US after the embassy bombings in East Africa and the attack on the destroyer the USS Cole no doubt contributed to the audacity of the attacks of September 11
Other options, however, do exist and a combination of them could help bring down Saddam without necessarily engaging in outright military action.
First, local forces opposed to Saddam should be encouraged.
By this I do not mean the loudmouthed but totally ineffective so-called Iraqi Opposition.
The local forces to be encouraged - by special operations people and the provision of arms and training - are the leaders of the southern Shi'a and the northern Kurds.
In the latter case, the infrastructure for support already exists, though it was partially dismantled during the Clinton administration.
In the Shi'a south, still reeling from the brutal suppression of the ill-fated 1991 rebellion, contacts must be created and networks established.
Iran - a Land of Paradoxes

Iran is marking the 23
Iran does deserve to be classified as a regional and, perhaps, a global promoter of instability; its support for the fundamentalist Islamic terrorism of Hizbollah in Lebanon is, indeed, aimed at further undermining the diminishing chances for an Israeli-Palestinian reconciliation.
But internal developments in Iran are complex, and demonization of the Islamic Republic is not helpful.
Neither is a drawing a simple dichotomy between ``conservatives'' and ``reformers,'' the latter led by President Khattami, helpful.
In many respects, Iran is perhaps the most interesting country in the region, with the greatest potential for development leading to - not to a Western-style democracy - but greater opening and liberalization.
The paradox is that Iran's potential is embedded in its ideology as an Islamic state.
After the first turbulent and murderous years of the Iranian revolution, the last few years have shown some remarkable developments.
Among them:
Elections: these are confined to an Islamic discourse, and all candidates and parties must secure the imprimatur of the highest Islamic authority in the land before they can be listed on a ballot.
But despite these restrictions, there is a fierce contest between various groups and interpretations;
Women can vote and participate actively and publicly in political life.
Moreover, the general image of Iranian women suppressed behind their black chadors is more complicated than it first seems.
For example, in medicine: because male doctors are prevented by strict Islamic law from treating women, the government has encouraged the training of female doctors.
Today, there are many more women doctors in Iran than under the Shah, and the number of women dying at childbirth is among the lowest in the region.
The government has also instituted a very pro-active birth control program, and has found a way of legitimizing it within an Islamic context, saying ``we want educated Islamic families, not just large Islamic families.''
Iran, as a consequence, has one of the lowest birth rates in the region.
Because elections to the Majlis (Parliament) and the Presidency are contested, they are meaningful.
It is, for example, clear that President Khattami was elected with the support of women and younger people, and the ``establishment'' candidate was not elected.
There is nothing like this in any Arab country: In Egypt or Syria (just as in Belarus) there is virtually only one candidate, and he receives between 97-98% of the vote.
Parliamentary debates are real, and real contested voting takes place. Again, this is nothing like the rubber-stamp sham parliaments of countries like Egypt and Syria.
The shades of gray have real consequences for policy towards Iran: as an Iranian political scientist recently put it at a seminar in Germany, younger people in Iran do feel themselves to be Muslims, and Iran will never become a secular society.
But they view their Islam as part of their Iranian identity, whereas the older clerics viewed Islam as a universal revolutionary identity.
These younger people - the Iranian scholar claimed - are first of all Iranian nationalists, and would like to dissociate themselves from Middle Eastern politics, in particular the Arab-Israeli conflict.
They will continue, of course, to give verbal support for the Palestinian course, but it is not at the top of their agenda.
In sum, Iran presents a complex, sometimes confusing picture.
But anyone who knows European history can identify a parallel: the Calvinist, Puritan revolution.
The Calvinists of Geneva, or Cromwell's Puritans, were - like the mullahs of Teheran - biblio-centric, with a Holy Book as their model for the ideal society.
Their society was meant to be puritanical, frugal, non-permissive, with laws against conspicuous consumption and luxuries.
It was also anti-feminist, anchored in patriarchal family structures.
Because the Calvinists did not accept a Church hierarchy, they - like the Iranian Shi'ites who are not part of the Sunni majoritarian universalism - based their legitimacy on the community of believers and so introduced elections.
But once you hold real elections, different modes of interpretation of the Holy Book become possible and legitimate.
Suddenly, there exists a mechanism for participation, control, dissent (limited as it may be) and the introduction of innovative strategies that seek to legitimize change within a traditional context.
In Europe, after all, Calvin's Geneva - an autocratic theocracy, more similar to Khomeini's Teheran than to any other regime - eventually developed, through English Puritanism, towards modern parliamentary government.
Indeed, in Britain until the l820's only members of the Church of England could vote in Parliament or be elected to it.
Will Shi'ite Iran follow a road similar to that of the European Calvinists?
Nothing is pre-determined; but the parallel is striking.
For all of today's involvement of some Iranian leaders in terrorism, the picture is more complex, more interesting - and perhaps more promising than President Bush's speech suggests.
Srebrenica is a moral stain on the UN and UN-sponsored forces, and the lesson should be heeded for the future.
In Srebrenica, Pontius Pilate would have felt vindicated; humanity, once again, was found to be wanting.
A Saudi Protectorate for the Palestinians
From Hosni Mubarak to Ariel Sharon, Middle East leaders are trekking to Washington to discuss restarting the peace process.
President Bush talks of a Palestinian state and of reforming the Palestinian authority, but (so far) offers no road map to achieving either.
Here Shlomo Avineri, once Director-General of Israel's Foreign Ministry, proposes an innovative approach to reach both goals.
Two conflicting needs assail the Middle East.
The Palestinians must rebuild political structures almost completely destroyed by Israel's recent incursions into the West Bank.
Yet it is also clear that the Palestinians are unable to create a polity untainted by terrorism and free of an ideology that violently repudiates Israel's right to exist.
After the Oslo agreements were reached a decade ago, supporters of the peace process, in Israel and abroad, hoped that the PLO - an armed national liberation movement deeply enmeshed in terrorism - would transform itself into a responsible and viable political structure.
Only then would a sovereign Palestinian state be able to live in peace alongside Israel.
If the ANC could make such a transition in South Africa, why not the Palestinians?
The hope that Yasser Arafat might become a Palestinian Nelson Mandela inspired even Israelis skeptical about the Oslo process.
This was not to be.
Arafat missed the historic opportunity to achieve a Palestinian state in 2000 when he rejected proposals by President Clinton and then Israeli Premier Barak at Camp David and later in Egypt.
Instead, he launched an armed intifada, in which competing Palestinian militias unleashed terrorism and suicide attacks against Israeli civilian targets - not only in the occupied territories, but also in Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, Haifa, Hadera, Afula, and Netanya.
Some militias were under Arafat's direct control, while others got semi-official support from him, and still others were his antagonists.
Their common aim was to wrest from a frightened and terrorized Israel what could not be achieved by diplomacy.
Palestinian territories descended into a lawless chaos reminiscent of Lebanon in the 1970-80's.
But Ariel Sharon's government should not be allowed to use the Palestinians' utter failure at peaceful nation building as an alibi for continued occupation.
What, then, is to be done?
President Bush's support for reforming the Palestinian Authority is well intentioned.
But to imagine a democratic and transparent Palestinian Authority when neither Syria, Egypt nor Saudi Arabia (or any other Arab country) show signs of democratization, is a pipe dream.
Equally well-intentioned UN and EU ideas about introducing an international force to separate Israel and the Palestinians originate with paper-shuffling diplomats, whose previous experiences in peacekeeping (say, in Srebrenica or Rwanda) do not inspire confidence.
Will an international force hunt down suicide bombers?
Will it possess intelligence assets and the will to fight if needed?
Such a force is dangerous nonsense.
Palestinian institutions must be rebuilt, but within a legitimate Arab context.
Palestine at the Crossroads
President George W. Bush's long-awaited speech on the Middle East combined hope for both sides with extremely tough language.
The hope was clear: Israelis deserve security and a life without fear of suicide bombings and other acts of terrorism; Palestinians deserve dignity, an end to the Israeli occupation, sovereignty, and statehood.
The current leadership, he maintained, has not fought terrorism, but has instead encouraged and even "trafficked" in it.
One cannot imagine a harsher condemnation of Arafat and the entire Palestinian leadership.
Bush is now clearly suggesting that Arafat is not a partner for peace, that the Oslo agreements are, in effect, dead, and thus that the Palestinian Authority as constituted by them does not exist anymore.
By adopting this policy, Bush is walking a fine line between Arab pressure to support the emergence of a Palestinian state and his own commitment to fight terrorism and not reward suicide bombers.
The speech was a masterful blend of the carrot and the stick.
But Bush now faces two challenges--one major, the other minor--in pushing his policy forward.
The major challenge is how the demand for a change in the Palestinian leadership will be met.
A crucial hallmark of Palestinian society is the weakness of its institutions: civic organizations are woefully under-developed, and responsive party structures that can effectively representing social interests do not exist--except those of the armed militias, like Fatah or Hamas.
As a result, elections in Palestine currently mean about as much as they did in the old Soviet Union.
How will democratic change come about in such a society?
Will it follow the path of chaotic, violent regime collapse by which Nicolae Ceausescu lost power in Romania?
Or will the Palestinians change their autocratic leadership peacefully, as in Serbia when Slobodan Milosevic was ousted?
Both options cannot be ruled out.
President Bush also mentioned Arab help in bringing about a change of Palestinian leadership.
Does he have in mind something like a Saudi protectorate over the Palestinians, sanctioned by the Arab League?
It may not be a bad idea.
An Egyptian Sakharov
Saad Eddin Ibrahim is Egypt's most prominent social scientist--and the most independent-minded in a conformist society ruled by President Hosni Mubarak's authoritarian regime.
For years, Prof. Ibrahim headed the Cairo-based Ibn-Khaldun Institute, which undertook, with the European Union's encouragement, pioneering studies on women and minority rights, as well as electoral practices, in Egypt.
In a country where the President has been consistently re-elected with 97% of the vote since 1980, Ibrahim's institute is the only academic research organization that dares to ask troubling questions about the way Egypt is run.
Two years ago, Prof. Ibrahim, together with practically all of the Ibn-Khaldun Institute staff, were arrested and put on trial before a State Security Court on trumped up charges.
The allegations included financial irregularities, receiving EU funds without the proper ministerial authorization, and "tarnishing Egypt's image."
Prof. Ibrahim was sentenced to seven years imprisonment.
After diplomatic pressure was applied by the United States (through his American-born wife, Prof. Ibrahim holds US citizenship) and the EU, he was granted a re-trial.
This ended days ago with the old verdict reaffirmed: seven years in prison.
Twenty-seven of the Institute's staff members also received jail sentences, and the Institute is now practically destroyed.
Any dictator, from Saddam Hussein to Robert Mugabe, could take pride in this abuse of power.
But because Mubarak regime's is considered moderate, pro-Western, and helpful in the context of Israeli-Palestinian relations, the West's response to this and other abuses remains muted.
Indeed, the US Charge d'Affaires in Cairo expressed mere "disappointment" at the verdict--a response that gives understatement a bad name.
Since the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington last year, America and the EU recognize (or say that they do) that the lack of legitimate channels of opposition in Arab countries pushes people who might otherwise be mere critics of governments into the arms of extreme Islamic fundamentalists.
Saad Eddin Ibrahim is a liberal: he is also a staunch Egyptian and Arab nationalist.
He has vehemently condemned Israeli policies vis-à-vis the Palestinians, and is a critic of many aspects of US foreign policy.
But his has always been the voice of a responsible opposition.
Indeed, his is the type of voice that Egyptian civil society needs if there is ever to be a chance that the country's Pharaonic authoritarian regime--symbolized by President Mubarak's high-handedness--is to be reformed.
Just because Mubarak's government persecutes Islamic terrorists, and is an ally in the war against fundamentalist extremism, is no reason to give him carte blanche to repress every attempt to open up Egyptian society.
Western intellectuals, who were instrumental in pressuring the Soviet Union in support of Andrei Sakharov, have been singularly quiet when it comes to Ibrahim.
An Arab intellectual persecuted by an Arab regime, it seems, is nowhere near the top of their agenda.
But it is the EU that is proving most complicit.
After all, it was the EU's effort to stimulate Egyptian civil society with its grant of funds to the Ibn-Khaldun Institute that incited Ibrahim's persecution.
The EU's silence in the face of his arrest and imprisonment is shameful.
For not just Ibrahim, but the values that the EU professes to uphold, have been on trial in Egypt, and they have been mocked by the Mubarak's regime idea of justice.
Europe must work--promptly--to overturn Ibrahim's conviction.
The EU should consider blocking all its educational and cultural programs in Egypt if the verdict on Ibrahim and his associates is not overturned and the Ibn Khaldun Institute not re-opened and restored to full vigor.
Just as the fight for Andrei Sakharov was also a fight for an open society in Russia and thus helped dismantle Communist tyranny, so the fight for Ibrahim's freedom is a fight to put an end to Egypt's oppressive authoritarian regime.
The Middle East Dream Map
The recent push given by President George W. Bush to the so-called Middle East "road map" is welcome, and the fact that both Israel and the Palestinians have accepted it is a good omen.
Yet the chances that it will bring real, as opposed to merely rhetorical, progress toward reconciliation remain slim.
The reasons are manifold: first, what is called a "road map" is in reality little more than a wish list of what has to be done in order to achieve peace between Israel and the Palestinians.
It is a noble set of goals, but it sometimes appears to be distant from the region's political realities.
For example, the road map rightly acknowledges that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict cannot be solved in a void; regional considerations must be taken into account.
The plan calls for far-reaching Israeli concessions: withdrawal from the West Bank and Gaza, dismantling of settlements, some compromise about Jerusalem.
At the same time, the "quartet" that composed the road map--the US, the EU, Russia, and the UN--realizes that Israel cannot be convinced to make such concessions without a fundamental change in the general attitude of the Arab world to the existence of the Jewish state.
Despite peace with Egypt and Jordan, Israel remains threatened by such countries as Syria and Libya, whose extremist regimes are deeply involved in violent terrorism against civilians in Israel and either possess or try to possess weapons of mass destruction.
For this reason, the road map premises peace between Israel and the Palestinians on normalization of relations between Israel and all Arab countries.
Can this really be achieved in the foreseeable future?
Does the US--or, for that matter the Quartet--really believe they know how to move Syria or Libya from their current closed-mind position, which threatens Israel's existence?
There is no indication in the road map that the initiators have thought this out beyond wishing out loud that it would happen.
Similarly, the road map is an attempt to revive the Oslo peace process.
But this process, based in the 1993 Oslo accords between Israel and the PLO, has been in serious trouble since Yasser Arafat rejected the peace package offered to him by Prime Minister Ehud Barak, with the support of President Bill Clinton, at Camp David in December 2000.
This was a watershed in Middle East politics--a massive change for the worse.
The Palestinians' refusal to accept - or even continue to negotiate about -- the most generous and comprehensive Israeli offer since l967 in exchange for an end-of-conflict agreement signified that the Palestinians are not ready to accept Israel's legitimacy.
There is now much more bitterness, fear, and hatred on both sides than in 2000, when the Camp David negotiations failed.
The direct and indirect support given by the Palestinian Authority to suicide bombing against civilians in Israel suggested to most Israelis that the Palestinians still view attacks against civilians as a legitimate weapon.
The sometimes-brutal Israeli responses to such terrorism further embittered the Palestinians against Israel.
True, the sidelining of Arafat and the appointment of Abu Mazen as the Palestinian Prime Minister is an important step in the right direction.
But Abu Mazen's real power has yet to be tested.
Does he really control the murky financial resources of the PLO, which gave Arafat so much real power beyond the formal title of head of the Palestinian Authority?
Most importantly, does Abu Mazen have the political will and power to really suppress--harshly, if necessary--the murderous terrorist gangs that control so much of the Palestinian population?
Much depends on the answers to these questions.
Last but not least: by the admission of its drafters, the road map will take a number of years to implement--in the best case two, in the worst case three or four.
It would need constant follow-up on dozens of contentious points at the highest level, i.e., the US President.
Is President Bush--or any US President--capable of effectively exercising his enormous authority, day in and day out for two or three years, to ensure that the parties really translate what might be just a verbal acceptance of vague language into painful, and even politically dangerous, decisions?
Past experience is not encouraging.
The attention span of a US President is limited on any issue.
Yet without his constant attention, the road map will run into the Middle East sand dunes that have already buried so many well-intentioned peace plans.
What, then, can be achieved?
Perhaps, as in Bosnia and Kosovo--where nobody talks about a permanent solution, but violence has been stopped--what is needed is stabilization, an end to daily bloodshed, de-escalation of hostility, and some mutual confidence building.
Israelis and Palestinians are not yet ready for the tough political decisions envisaged by the road map.
They need a series of stopgap measures to bring stability and safety for civilians on both sides.
With such de-escalation, perhaps at some time in the future true reconciliation will be possible.
However difficult or sad to admit, the moment is not ripe for more than this.
Palestinian Refugees and German Expellees
The atmosphere could not have been more tranquil: a former royal castle in the rolling hills of the Taunus region near Frankfurt, where statesmen and politicians held an annual meeting dealing with the Middle East.
Europeans and Americans, Israelis and Iranians, Egyptians and Turks, Palestinians and Tunisians rubbed shoulders.
The novelty this year was the presence of representatives from post-Saddam Iraq, among them an official from the Kurdish Regional Government, as well as a high ranking Shi'a representative.
The new situation in Iraq, along with the Middle East road map, were at the center of attention.
On the opening night, a senior German government minister, himself deeply involved in Middle Eastern affairs, addressed both subjects, displaying great sensitivity both to Israeli and Palestinian concerns.
The evening proceeded along the expected anodyne trajectory until a Lebanese academic raised the issue of the right of Palestinian refugees to return to Israel.
The senior German minister listened attentively, and then said: ``This is an issue with which we in Germany are familiar; may I ask my German colleagues in the audience to raise their hand if they, or their families, have been refugees from Eastern Europe?''
There was a moment of silence.
The issue is embarrassing in Germany, fraught with political and moral landmines.
Slowly, hands were raised: by my count, more than half of the Germans present (government officials, journalists, businessmen) raised a hand: they, or their families, had been Vertriebene --expelled from their ancestral homes in Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and Yugoslavia after World War II.
It is estimated that up to 10 million were expelled, and with their descendants they make up today almost double that number--almost one in four Germans.
In the hushed room, the senior German minister continued: he himself was born in Eastern Europe, and his family was expelled in the post-1945 anti-German atmosphere. ``But,'' he added, ``neither I nor any of my colleagues claim the right to go back.
It is precisely because of this that I can now visit my ancestral hometown and talk to the people who now live in the house in which I was born--because they do not feel threatened, because they know I don't want to displace them or take their house.''
The minister went on to explain that peace in Europe is today embedded in this realization: if East European countries had thought that millions of ethnic Germans would like to return, ``the Iron Curtain would have never come down.''
It was a highly emotional response to the Lebanese academic's question--one that Arab representatives chose later on to ignore.
But it was just one more expression of the context in which the issue of the 1948 Palestinian refugees has to be addressed.
As the German senior minister reminded the audience, there are numerous parallels in recent history to the Palestinian refugee problem.
Anyone who now claims that the 1948 Palestinian refugees have a claim, in principle, to return to Israel, must confront the question: should the millions of Germans expelled from Eastern Europe after 1945 also have the same right of return to their lost homes?
The German minister supplied the answer.
Similarly, if Helmut Kohl's government had insisted in 1990 that all Germans expelled from Poland and Czechoslovakia have a right to return to those countries, German reunification would not have gained the broad international agreement that it did.
It would be clear that what West Germany had in mind was not reunification, but reversing the consequences of Nazi Germany's defeat in 1945.
The Palestinians' demand for the right of return has an analogous meaning.
Insistence on it in 2000 at Camp David and Taba made clear to most Israelis that what the Palestinians have in mind is not undoing the consequences of the Six Day War in 1967.
Rather, the demand for a right of return amounts to an effort to reverse the consequences of their defeat in 1948, when the Arab world went to war to prevent the state of Israel from being born.
It is worth keeping in mind what advocates of a Palestinian right of return now prefer to forget: Palestinian Arabs and four Arab members of the UN went to war in 1948 not only against Israel, but against international legitimacy and the UN plan for a two-state solution.
There is no other example of UN member countries going to war to prevent implementation of UN decisions.
This is what the Arab countries and the Palestinians did.
Clearly there is a serious humanitarian issue involved.
The fact that the refugees' plight was compounded by their use as political pawns for half a century is a measure of the cynicism and immorality of Arab political leadership.
Nonetheless, the humanitarian issue remains.
The senior German minister referred to it explicitly, both with regard to the Palestinians and the post-1945 German refugees.
But the political consequences for him were clear: the revanchist call for a return of refugees--in both the German and the Palestinian case--is a formula for instability, if not war.
Three Iraqs, Not One
America's mounting difficulties in setting up a coherent form of government in Iraq, let alone a democratic one, inspire a question that most statesmen consider unthinkable: is it possible that there is no way to re-constitute Iraq as one state, and that alternative options must be considered, unpalatable as they may appear?
Like so many problems in the re-birth of states wounded by dictatorship--Eastern Europe is a good example--Iraq's difficulties have deep historical roots.
To blame everything on the heavy-handedness of the Americans is too simplistic and shallow, even if their mistakes have, indeed, been legion.
Iraq was established in the 1920's by the British, who occupied the region after the Ottoman Empire disintegrated at the end of WWI.
Their policies were dictated by British imperial interests, and gave no consideration to the wishes, interests, or characteristics of the local population.
What British imperial planners did was to stitch together three disparate provinces of the old Ottoman Empire and put at their head a prince from Hedjaz (now a part of Saudi Arabia).
The three provinces--Mosul, Baghdad, and Basra--each had very distinct characters and very different population structures.
Mosul had a Kurdish majority, with significant Assyrian-Christian and Turkoman minorities; Baghdad was mainly Sunni; and Basra was predominantly Shi'ite.
Throwing such disparate groups into one body politic doomed the newly invented country to decades of strife and repression.
The old Ottoman Empire ruled these three provinces--as it ruled all of its imperial possessions--through its historically autocratic means.
The challenge facing the new Iraqi state was to try to create a non-despotic, relatively representative form of government in which all sectors of the population would find an expression of their political will.
This turned out to be an impossible mission.
For this reason Iraq--even before Saddam Hussein--always suffered the most repressive regime of any Arab state.
In a country where Shi'ites form the majority, the Sunnis--traditionally the hegemonic group in all Arab countries--were totally unwilling to allow any democratic process to jeopardize their rule.
A Shi'ite insurrection was brutally put down in the 1920's (with the help of the British Royal Air Force).
Similarly, Kurdish attempts at autonomy before WWII were drowned in bloody massacres of tens of thousands of innocent civilians, and even the Assyrian Christian minority--a relatively small group, with no political ambitions--was exposed to murderous assaults in the 1930's.
Under these conditions, with the Sunni ruling minority constantly feeling threatened, it was no accident that the only attempt in any Arab country to establish something like a pro-Nazi fascist regime occurred in Iraq in the early 1940's under Rashid Ali al-Khailani.
The British suppressed this misadventure, but not before hundreds of Jews in Baghdad were murdered in a wild farhood (pogrom) instigated by the short-lived pro-Nazi government.
Saddam's regime was merely the most extreme manifestation of the harsh underlying fact that Iraq's geography and demography condemned it to rule by the iron fist.
Nor has Saddam's fall changed this fact: anti-US violence is not only an expression of anger at foreign occupation; it is also a Sunni attempt to abort the establishment of a democratic order that would put them--the historical masters--in a subordinate position.
Similarly, one cannot see the Kurds in the north submitting willingly to a Baghdad-dominated Arab regime, let alone a Shi'ite one (most Kurds are Sunnis).
There is little understanding in the West of how deep the Sunni/Shi'ite divide runs.
Put yourself in pre-1648 Europe, a time when Protestants and Catholics slaughtered each other with abandon, and you'll understand the enmity immediately.
So what can be done?
Yugoslavia's example shows that in multi-ethnic and multi-religious countries deeply riven by conflict, partition and separation may be the only way to ensure stability and democratization.
There is no doubt today that Croatia and Serbia--despite their difficulties--stand a better chance of becoming more or less stable democracies than if they were still fighting for mastery among themselves within the Procrustean bed of the former Yugoslavia.
Nor is federation an alternative--as the terms of the federation itself become the bones of contention (see Bosnia or Cyprus).
Even the pacific Czechs and Slovaks found it easier to develop their respective democratic structures through a velvet divorce rather than be joined in an unworkable marriage.
The time has come to think the unthinkable, about creating a Kurdish state in the north, an Arab Sunni one in the center around Baghdad, and an Arab Shi'ite state in the south around Basra.
Repeating mantras about territorial integrity--the conventional wisdom of international relations--is productive only as long as it ensures stability and averts chaos.
Again, as Yugoslavia--and the Soviet Union--showed, once strife replaces stability, territorial integrity loses its strategic meaning and legitimacy.
This is not a universal prescription for ethnically homogenous states.
The point is simply that there are moments in history when democratization and nation building coincide, and that in deeply divided societies the minimum consensus needed for both to succeed simultaneously is difficult to achieve.
All this may run contrary to conventional wisdom, but who thought that the USSR would disintegrate?
Creative and innovative thinking is needed about Iraq; otherwise today's mayhem will continue--and worsen.
A Referendum For Kurdistan?
The assassination of the President of Iraq's Governing Council makes it crystal clear that the US is failing to create the minimal law-and-order needed for any sort of orderly transfer of power to take place by June 30th.
Barely two months ago, the signing of a constitutional document by a US-appointed group of un-elected Iraqi officials was heralded as if it were the re-enactment of America's constitutional convention in Philadelphia in 1787.
But by now it is clear that this is a worthless piece of paper.
No imposed constitution, however elegant it may be, will be very helpful to Coalition forces when confronted with the type of mayhem seen in towns like Fallujah or Najjaf.
In the Kurdish region of northern Iraq, however, the situation is completely different: in the last ten years, under the protection of the Allies' no-fly zone, and even more so since the toppling of Saddam, the Kurdish regional government has been able to establish and sustain a relatively orderly administration.
It has overcome tribal and party differences and created a de facto functioning government, with an impressive record on development issues such as education, irrigation, and construction - and, above all, with no violence.
Confronted with the debacle in the rest of (Arab) Iraq, the question has to be asked why the US-led coalition should not hold a referendum in the Kurdish region, asking the population how they would like to be ruled.
After all, the Kurds have, by any internationally accepted standards, a right to self-determination.
Historically, the Kurds - who are distinct in language, culture, and historical consciousness from Arabs - never had their day in court.
After World War I and the fall of the Ottoman Empire, the victorious Allies promised them a state of their own - a promise that was cynically betrayed when British and French imperial interests took precedence.
Since then, the Kurds have suffered under the despotic rule of rival ethnic groups.
There are obvious obstacles to holding such a referendum, primarily because the US does not have a mandate to dispose of Iraq as it pleases.
But the same goes for the rest of Iraq: the US is now lamely asking for a UN resolution mandating a transfer of power to a legitimate Iraqi government - but such an authorization is highly unlikely, nor is there anyone in Iraq to whom authority can conceivably be transferred.
Why should the one region - and people - who run an orderly government, are not involved in murder, attacks on mosques, and suicide bombing of schoolchildren, be penalized?
Another objection is the opposition of Turkey - and, to a lesser degree, Iran and Syria - to granting the Iraqi Kurds self-determination.
But if one thinks in terms of universal norms of human rights, what right has Turkey to dictate internal development in another country?
After all, nobody accepts Israel's claim to oppose as a matter of principle the establishment of a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza.
The same should apply to Turkey.
If Turkey grants its own Kurdish minority more cultural and language rights and allows legitimate Kurdish political representation in the Turkish parliament, the willingness of Turkish Kurds to oppose Ankara will be diminished.
In the nineteenth century, the joint interests of the authoritarian Russian, German, and Austrian Empires prevented the establishment of a free Poland: such unholy alliances have no place in the twenty-first century.
Recently, under the aegis of the UN, a referendum on the future of Cyprus was held within the island's Greek and Turkish communities.
The outcome was paradoxical, and not to the liking of those who initiated it: but the right of the communities to determine their future was accepted.
Why not in Iraqi Kurdistan?
Perhaps to assuage political fears - and considerations of international law - any plebiscite in the Kurdish region should, initially, have only a consultative status.
But it will give legitimate expression to the will of a people long oppressed and entitled to their place in the sun.
Such a referendum may also concentrate minds among the Arab Sunnis and Shia in Iraq, when they come to realize that it is their violence that is dismantling Iraq.
Perhaps they may decide that violence is counter-productive and carries its own penalties, and may then follow the Kurdish example of curbing violence, which would help put Iraq together again without recourse to permanent repression.
If not, at the very least, the injustice suffered by the Kurdish people for generations would, at long last, be rectified.
The Refugee Dilemma
One reason Greek Cypriots rejected last April UN Secretary General Kofi Annan's plan for the reunification of Cyprus was that an overwhelming majority of them felt it did not do justice to the claims of refugees displaced during the 1974 Turkish invasion.
This was also one of the few occasions when international public opinion became aware that there was a refugee problem on the island, because few people knew that refugees from that war still exist.
When Turkey invaded Cyprus in 1974 after an abortive attempt by the Greek military junta in Athens to carry out Enosis (unification with Greece), 250,000 or so Greek Cypriots were uprooted from their homes.
Some fled in terror from the invading army, some were expelled - the usual complex, morally problematic picture that emerges in such situations.
Although overwhelmed, the Greek Cypriot community reacted with humanity, solidarity, and prudence.
Initially, refugees camps were set up, but the Greek Cypriot government decided that while it will not surrender the refugees' claim eventually to return to their homes in the North, it would do its utmost in the interim not to leave them vegetating in squalid camps.
No UN-sponsored refugee agency was established to help the refugees.
Instead, with some international help, but mostly out of its own resources, the Republic of Cyprus - a small, then not very prosperous country that was devastated by war - launched a re-settlement and rehabilitation program as a national project.
Government loans were offered for housing construction. In many cases, refugees built their own new homes.
Businesses were encouraged with government subsidies and loans.
Schools and training centers were established.
Within a few years, the refugees were absorbed into the economy and society of the southern, Greek Cypriot sector of the island.
As in post-World War II West Germany, much of the current prosperity in Cyprus today is an outcome of the boost the economy received from the absorption of refugees.
Anyone visiting the Greek Cypriot part of the island nowadays will not find refugee camps: most of the millions of tourists are unaware of the fact that more than a third of the Greek Cypriots they encounter are refugees or descendants of refugees.
The Greek Cypriot community can justly be proud of the way they handled the humanitarian and social problems of the refugees, without at any point surrendering their claims to the lands they lost.
Equally commendable has been the Greek Cypriot strategic decision to follow a Gandhi-like policy of non-violence: while there is deep bitterness about the Turkish occupation, and the fact that Turkish settlers were implanted in the North, the Greek Cypriot community decided not to use violence against the occupation.
Not one incident of Greek Cypriot terrorism or violence against Turkish occupation has occurred in more than a quarter of a century.
This is also one of the reasons few people have ever heard about the Greek Cypriot refugees.
It could, of course, be different: had Greek Cypriots followed the Palestinian example since 1948 - that is, kept the refugees in camps, segregated them from the non-refugee society, and fed their children a daily militaristic message of hatred, revenge, and terrorism - a completely different atmosphere would permeate the island.
The Greek Cypriot example shows that it is simply not true that the occupied have no recourse other than violence and terrorism.
Recourse to violence and terror is a moral and strategic choice.
The Greek Cypriots chose the path of non-violence; the Palestinians chose the opposite route.
There is always a choice, and there are always consequences.
Consider what the Greek Cypriot community has achieved - a thriving economy, no one living under conditions of misery and humiliation in camps, membership in the European Union - compared to the catastrophe the Palestinian choice has brought to their own people.
Perhaps on the level of public relations, the Palestinian leadership - sacrificing their own people on the altar of propaganda - can bask in their achievement: yet it is their own people who suffer.
These leaders would do better to look across the Mediterranean at Cyprus and see how - without giving up claims to disputed land - refugees can live in dignity and honor.
But then again, the Republic of Cyprus is a democracy, while the Palestinians have not been able to emancipate themselves from the violent militarized option that has brought them such misery.
The Other Palestinian Revolution
The euphoria that has, for over a week, greeted Mahmoud Abbas's election as President of the Palestinian Authority was perhaps justified.
But now it is time for a clear-eyed assessment of what lies before Palestinians, Israelis, and, perhaps more importantly, for the wider Arab world.
Such an assessment requires acknowledging that the election was far from flawless: Hamas and Islamic Jihad boycotted the poll, and Marwan Barghouti, a fellow Fatah member with Abbas and the one candidate who could seriously have challenged him, was ungently persuaded by the movement's leadership to withdraw his candidacy in order to present a unified front.
Moreover, Abbas (also known as Abu Mazen) succeeded in getting the dozen or so Palestinian security services and militias under his control.
This guaranteed his victory, though the parades of armed men brandishing guns at his rallies were not exactly what democratic norms call for.
Yet the fact remains that after decades of Yasir Arafat's autocratic rule, and despite the obvious constraints of continued Israeli occupation, the Palestinians did elect a leader in a relatively free and competitive election.
For years, Arafat avoided holding elections, as required by the laws of the Palestinian Authority, under the pretense that they cannot be held under occupation: but, lo and behold, two months after his demise, an election was held - and with resounding success.
The presidential election will obviously serve as a catalyst for renewed, and possibly more successful, negotiations with Israel.
But the impact of the Palestinian vote will also be watched closely in the Arab world, because what happened in the West Bank and Gaza is unparalleled in the annals of Arab politics.
Abbas will now bask in the glow of having been elected.
Nothing like this has happened in any Arab country.
Indeed, Abbas is now the only Arab leader who came to power in a more or less free election.
Is Palestinian society so different from other Arab societies?
Not really.
But there were several unique factors in the Palestinian context.
First, there was strong external pressure: confronted and exasperated by Arafat's deviousness and autocratic style, the United States and the European Union clearly told the Palestinians that any future support for their quest for independence would depend on their going through a reasonably acceptable democratic process.
Second, most Palestinians perceived that their ability to go through such a democratic process was itself a significant step in their struggle against Israel.
Finally, Palestinians have been exposed not only to the obvious hardships of occupation while living under Israeli rule for the better part of four decades; they were also able to experience, at close range, a liberal democracy at work - a free press, an independent judiciary, and political pluralism.
The dialectic of occupation plays strange games, both with occupier and occupied.
The Palestinian elections were seen all over the Arab world on Al-Jazeera and other Arab TV channels.
They must have focused people's minds on their own stunted political conditions.
If the Palestinians, under Israeli occupation, can choose their own leaders, why can't the same happen in Cairo or Damascus, in Ryadh or Algiers?
When the jubilation and the justly earned compliments for the Palestinians subside, both Arab rulers and Arab masses (the much hyped "Arab street") may start asking some hard questions.
The Palestinians have shown that it is not true that an Arab society cannot progress towards representative institutions.
So why can't this progress be emulated in other Arab societies?
Perhaps a time bomb has been planted under the thrones of Arab potentates - kings, emirs and presidents.
While Iraq - an attempt to import democracy by force - is failing, the paradoxical conditions of an Arab democracy under Israeli occupation may be a threat that Arab rulers have not yet comprehended.
Humpty-Dumpty Iraq
The problem is not with the constitution, but with the conventional wisdom -- almost an idée fixe -- that Iraq is a viable modern nation-state, and that all it needs to make it work properly is the right political institutions.
But this is a fallacy, and responsible leaders should begin to think of alternatives.
The Iraqi state, established in the 1920's by British imperialist planners (with Winston Churchill in the lead), is a strange pastiche of three disparate provinces of the old Ottoman Empire: Mosul in the north with a Kurdish majority, Baghdad in the center with a Sunni Arab majority, and Basra in the south with a Shia Arab majority.
For their own political reasons, the British put the Sunni Arabs -- never more than 25% of the population -- in control of the whole country, and even imported a Sunni Arab Hashemite prince to rule over their creation.
Ever since, the country could be held together only by an iron fist: Iraq's history is replete with Shia, Kurdish, and even Christian Assyrian revolts, all put down in bloody fashion by the ruling Sunni minority.
Throughout its history, modern Iraq has always been the most oppressive of the Arab countries.
Saddam's rule was only the most brutal in a long line of Sunni regimes.
It was this Sunni hegemony -- and not merely that of Saddam's Ba'athist regime -- that was toppled by the United States.
But, given Iraq's history and demography, the American attempt to refashion the country as a functioning democracy has foundered on three shoals: the Shia majority's empowerment, the Kurds's refusal to give up their hard-won de facto mini-state in the north, and the Sunnis' violent campaign to undermine any system that they do not lead.
In short, the draft constitution is an attempt to square a circle.
The Sunni resistance -- a guerilla and terrorist war that was well prepared in the last years of Saddam's rule -- will continue to try to subvert any semblance of order representing the current majority Shia-Kurdish coalition.
The Sunnis will go on with their murderous attacks on Shias, Kurds, and the US-led military coalition.
They will probably boycott the constitutional referendum and all subsequent elections, just as they have boycotted the previous elections.
After all, given the brutal logic of their long hegemony in Iraq, why should the Sunnis contemplate submitting to a process that is premised on their minority status, particularly when whole areas of the country are under the effective control of the Sunni insurgency?
Similarly, why should the Shias, for their part, submit to Sunni hegemony rather than building up their own political structure in the south, modeled on what the Kurds have already achieved in the north?
Let's be frank: Iraq is going the way of Yugoslavia as it disintegrated in the early 1990's.
This should be acknowledged and ultimately welcomed, despite conventional diplomatic norms regarding the inviolability of the territorial integrity of existing states. 
Of course, such norms are helpful.
But once a state disintegrates, as happened in Yugoslavia, no constitutional formulations can save it.
Constitutions works only if all sides have an interest in operating within the proposed framework -- and this obviously is not the case in Iraq.
There is nothing sacrosanct in the continued existence of multi-ethnic and multi-religious states if their constitutive groups do not wish to live together.
On the contrary, there are lessons to be learned from the demise of the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, and even -- perhaps especially -- Czechoslovakia, which negotiated its break-up without violence.
By contrast, the current Bosnia-Herzegovina is an example of another failed attempt to keep a decrepit multi-ethnic entity alive: it doesn't work, and the country is held together only by the almost dictatorial power of the international community's High Representative and the presence of foreign troops.
It is time to face reality: the Kurdish region in the north is functioning in a reasonable way, and it has even been able to allay Turkey's fears that its existence will aggravate that country's own Kurdish problem.
With the Shias building their polity in the south, the Sunni areas too should be allowed to go their own way.
This may be more conducive to peace than trying to impose on them a hated occupation or an equally hated Shia hegemony.
The emergence of three states -- or highly autonomous regions -- instead of a unified Iraq is happening anyway, constitution or no constitution.
Nobody, it appears, can put Humpty-Dumpty Iraq together again.
But it will require courage to acknowledge what is occurring before our eyes, rather than continue to grasp at the chimera of a consolidated Iraqi state.
In fact, to acknowledge the obvious in Iraq is also to recognize that there are grounds for hope.
As in the former Yugoslavia, the separate entities now emerging may stand a better chance of developing a semblance of representative and eventually democratic governance than if Iraq's warring communities are forced to live together in the prison house that the country has always been for most of its citizens.
Hamas in Power
The Hamas victory is, first and foremost, an indication of the total failure of the traditional Palestinian leadership to create a body politic.
Palestine is not yet a state, but it is already a failed one.
Since the Oslo Accords of l993 between Israel and the PLO, the Palestinians enjoyed limited transitional autonomy.
To be sure, the new Palestinian Authority (PA) took power under difficult conditions, but which new liberation movement does not face serious challenges when it finally must govern?
The PA had an opportunity to lay the institutional foundations for a functioning state.
But, but instead of supplying the population with the necessary infrastructure -- economic development, education, welfare, medical services, housing, and refugee rehabilitation -- Yasser Arafat's Fatah-led PA spent more than 70% of its meager budget on a dozen competing security and intelligence services, neglecting all other spheres of activity.
It created what is called in Arabic a Mukhabarat (security services) state, very much like what is prevalent in almost all Arab countries -- Egypt, Syria, Saudi Arabia, republics and monarchies alike.
The vacuum that the PA left elsewhere, including the social sphere, was filled by Hamas.
Indeed, its popularity is due not only to its fundamentalist Islamic ideology and its commitment to the destruction of Israel.
The high esteem in which Palestinians hold Hamas also grew out of what Hamas actually did for them while the PA squandered its resources.
It was not only the endemic corruption of the official Palestinian leadership that turned so many Palestinians from it.
Hamas set up better schools, kindergartens, crèches for mothers, medical centers, welfare services, and programs for youth and women -- all of this in addition giving special grants to the families of suicide bombers.
In the elections, Hamas received its dividend for doing what the Fatah-led Palestinian Authority failed to do.
It is still an open question whether Hamas in government will become more pragmatic and less committed to terrorism: it certainly is a possibility, and one should not prejudge the outcome.
But nor, on the other hand, is it clear that the existing organs of the Palestinian Authority -- especially the security services at its disposal -- will allow a peaceful transfer of power.
Indeed, no such precedent exists: there has never been a peaceful transfer of power in any of the Arab League's 22 member states.
Israel's response to Hamas's victory will obviously be complicated by its own elections on March 28, and by a government headed by an interim prime minister, Ehud Olmert, owing to Sharon's incapacitation just weeks after leaving Likud and founding a new, centrist party, Kadima (Forward).
Despite Sharon's absence, Kadima maintains its lead in public opinion polls -- the most recent gave it 44 of the Knesset's 120 seats, compared to 21 for Labor and 14 for the right-wing rump-Likud, under Binyamin Netanyahu.
Kadima's success is due to Sharon's main innovation in Israeli politics: the successful unilateral disengagement from Gaza.
That withdrawal was based on the conviction that the gaps between the Israeli and Palestinian positions are too wide to enable meaningful negotiations.
Hence, Israel must start deciding the future boundaries of the country unilaterally, hoping for eventual negotiations at a later stage.
This is also the line adopted by Olmert.
But Hamas's victory suggests that the gaps between the Israeli and Palestinian sides will grow even wider, and that the chances for a negotiated settlement will recede even farther into the future.
This leaves further unilateral Israeli moves -- such as a partial set of withdrawals from selected areas in the West Bank -- as the only feasible option.
Realistic conflict management will replace utopian hopes for conflict resolution.
In a region full of paradoxes, the Hamas victory may have added another one: usually, when extremists on one side become stronger, it plays into the hands of extremists on the other side, producing a dangerous spiral effect.
In this case, however, the victory of the extremist Hamas may strengthen not the extremists of Likud, but, surprisingly, the more moderate centrists of Kadima.
One cannot be certain of such an outcome, of course, but it is now the best that one can realistically hope for.
Can Hamas Stay in Power?
The abduction of an Israeli soldier in the Gaza Strip, as well as the abduction and subsequent murder of an 18-year old Israeli civilian in the West Bank, have brought to the fore that question, which has haunted Israeli-Palestinian relations since Hamas won parliamentary elections in January.
The international community, led by the "Quartet" (the United States, the European Union, the United Nations, and Russia), has put three conditions to the Hamas government if it wishes to achieve international legitimacy and continue to be supported financially.
Hamas must recognize Israel's right to exist, stop all terrorist activities, and commit itself to carry out all previous international agreements signed by the Palestinian Authority.
These look like reasonable conditions to any outside observer.
To Hamas, however, they appear to undermine its very raison d'etre.
After all, this is an organization committed to the destruction of Israel -- its charter calls for a holy war against all Jews -- and the establishment of an Islamic state in all of historical Palestine.
Indeed, Article 22 of that charter reveals that Hamas views the Jews (together with the Freemasons and other nefarious organizations like Rotary International and the Lions Club), as responsible for the French and Bolshevik Revolutions, World War I, and World War II.
So it is no great surprise that Hamas rejected the Quartet's conditions.
At the same time, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen), who represents Fatah, which lost the January elections, has tried in vain to find common ground with Hamas through an ambiguous text known as "The Prisoners' Document."
This document was intended to serve as an implicit acceptance of Israel's right to exist.
But nothing of the sort appears in the truncated text approved by Hamas.
On the contrary, the text legitimizes continuing attacks against Israeli civilians in the West Bank, making it unacceptable to Israel -- and to the international community.
But the current crisis cannot be solved by words alone.
One of the paradoxical results of America's almost messianic belief in elections as a panacea for all the ills of the Middle East is that Hamas -- the winner of democratic elections -- has gained a degree of legitimacy that it never had before.
On the other hand, Hamas's history and current behavior clearly indicate that it regards elections as merely a political tool, and that it is devoid of any commitment to the norms and values underlying democracy.
Fascist and communist regimes of the past, which followed a similar instrumentalist approach to democracy, come to mind here.
Yet, at the same time, the US supports Abu Mazen, trying to undermine the Hamas government, thus casting a shadow on the credibility of its own commitment to democracy.
The current violence may escalate further, and could bring down the Hamas government.
On the other hand, diplomatic means may bring about the release of the Israeli soldier and put a stop to the firing of Qassam rockets from Gaza into Israel -- a daily occurrence that has challenged the credibility of the new Israeli government under Prime Minister Ehud Olmert.
But the fundamental problem is that, until now, at every historical juncture, the Palestinians refused to accept a compromise and consequently failed in nation-building.
In 1947, they refused the UN partition plan, which called for the establishments of two states in British Palestine.
In 1993, after the Oslo agreements, the Palestinian Authority established under Yasir Arafat became another militarized authoritarian regime, very much like Syria and Egypt, and did nothing to alleviate the suffering of the Palestinian refugees.
It was this failure that brought Hamas to power.
The current crisis is obviously the first serious test for Olmert and his plans for further withdrawal from Israeli-occupied territories.
But it is an even greater test for the Palestinians: will they once again be led by a radical and fanatical leadership into another national catastrophe?
Or will they finally realize that a future of independence, sovereignty, and dignity is open to them -- but only if they grant the Israelis what they rightly claim for themselves?
The international community can urge the Palestinians toward a decision.
But that decision, and its moral costs, remains in the hands of the Palestinians alone.
Putting Lebanon Together
When Israel withdrew its forces from southern Lebanon in 2000, the international understanding was that the Lebanese government would re-assert its authority in the evacuated area.
Hezbollah, which led the armed struggle against Israeli occupation, was to disarm and re-invent itself as a political force, representing the Shiite community that was historically marginalized by Lebanon's ruling Maronite, Sunni, and Druze elites.
None of this happened.
Instead of deploying its forces in southern Lebanon, the weak government in Beirut acquiesced in Hezbollah's determination to turn the area into a staging ground for attacks against Israel.
Over the last six years, Hezbollah established a virtual state-within-a-state: its militia became the only military force in southern Lebanon, setting up outposts along the frontier with Israel, sometimes only a few meters away from the border.
Occasionally, Hezbollah shelled Israel, and its leader, Hassan Nassrallah, continued his blood-curdling invective, not only against Israel and Zionism, but against all Jews.
UN Security Council resolution 1559, which explicitly called for the disarming of all militias and the reassertion of Lebanese government authority in the south, went unheeded.
After the much-heralded "Cedar Revolution" of 2005, Hezbollah even joined the Lebanese government, while at the same time maintaining its armed militia and control of the south.
Israel, for its part, still reeling from the trauma of its ill-begotten war in Lebanon in 1982, chose not to respond to Hezbollah's attacks and hoped that the attacks would not escalate.
Yet such absurd situations tend to explode, as occurred with Hezbollah's abduction of two Israeli soldiers within Israeli territory.
The continued existence of Hezbollah's illegitimate state-within-a-state can no longer be tolerated.
Yet Lebanon itself is too weak to assert its sovereignty.
On the other hand, Israel will not allow Hezbollah to re-establish itself along its border, or to maintain its missile capability.
To achieve any reassertion of effective Lebanese sovereignty in southern Lebanon, a robust international effort is needed, beyond the current hand wringing and rhetoric.
The main elements of such an international solution are the following:
To succeed, this force must act very differently from the UN's previous failed efforts in Lebanon.
The existing UN force in southern Lebanon, UNIFIL, is a sad joke.
Like the UN presence in Srebrenica during the Bosnian war, UNIFIL has given the UN a bad name: it never stopped terrorists from attacking Israel, nor did it stop the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982.
What is needed is a military delegation that has a clear mandate to use force.
It should be international, with the UN's blessing, but it should not be a UN force.
It could be based on NATO capabilities, with a strong European ingredient.
To add legitimacy for its delicate mission within an Arab country, soldiers from Morocco, Saudi Arabia, and perhaps Pakistan, should be added.
The mission of such a force should be to help deploy -- by force, if necessary -- the Lebanese Army in southern Lebanon, to participate in disarming Hezbollah, and to patrol the Israeli-Lebanese border, ensuring that no incursions take place from either side.
Last but not least: it is not widely known that one anomaly of Lebanon's status until this very day is that Syria has not fully recognized its existence as a sovereign nation (in Syrian school textbooks, Lebanon figures as part of Greater Syria).
Consequently, there are no normal diplomatic relations between the two countries -- no Syrian embassy in Beirut and no Lebanese embassy in Damascus.
This is absurd and dangerous, and the hapless Arab League has never truly addressed it.
To bolster Lebanese independence and security, and in line with UN resolution 1559, which brought about the withdrawal of Syrian forces from Lebanon, Syria should be pushed to recognize Lebanon's sovereignty and independence.
Hezbollah's existence as a mini-state in southern Lebanon is a flagrant violation of Lebanese sovereignty.
That vacuum of legitimate authority created the present crisis, and it must be extirpated.
Lebanon itself cannot establish its sovereignty in the country's south, and Israeli military force is incapable of doing it.
Empty words from St. Petersburg, Brussels, or UN headquarters will not suffice, nor will a mere ceasefire, as that would simply return the area to square one.
Instead, fundamental change is needed.
Only an effective military force, with international legitimacy, can supply it.
Otherwise, we are all condemned to the continuation of the present cycles of violence.
Will Olmert Survive?
The commission, headed by retired Supreme Court judge Eliyahu Winograd, has just published its interim report.
Its criticism of Olmert, Defense Minister Amir Peretz, and Chief-of-Staff Dan Halutz -- set forth in a detailed and meticulous 117-page assessment -- is harsh, but not surprising.
The Winograd Commission articulated what most Israelis already think: Olmert and Peretz lacked the military, security, and policy experience to confront a terrorist organization that raided Israeli territory, killed a number of soldiers and kidnapped two, and then launched thousands of rockets on civilian targets for over a month.
Indeed, the inexperience of the prime minister and the defense minister are unprecedented in Israel's history.
Olmert, who stepped into Ariel Sharon's shoes as leader of the new Kadima Party, was considered a competent but lackluster parliamentarian -- and later mayor of Jerusalem -- who was known more for his polemical style than for his political stature or gravitas.
For most Israelis, even those who voted for him as the bearer of Sharon's legacy after the Gaza disengagement, Olmert thus remained the accidental prime minister.
Likewise, Peretz, a rabble-rousing but effective trade unionist, surprised all when he won the Labor Party's leadership primary and then chose the defense portfolio over the treasury.
To many, the duo of Olmert and Peretz seemed to invite trouble.
Precisely because Israelis are aware of the constant security threat facing their country, they have always believed that their leaders should be able to lead Israel in war -- but also to ask the military tough questions when diplomacy may fail.
When such a moment arrived, totally out of the blue (or so it seemed) with Hezbollah's raid on July 12, 2006, Israel's two top politicians were completely out of their depth, stumbling into a war for which neither they nor the Israeli Army were prepared.
The military was led -- for the first time in its history -- by an Air Force general, Dan Halutz, who believed that everything could be solved by air power, creating a combustible combination of civilian ignorance and military arrogance.
In measured but devastating prose, the Winograd Commission gives failing marks to all three leaders.
Olmert decided to go into battle recklessly and unaware of the consequences.
Peretz was unable to gauge the strategic implications of his decisions.
And Halutz failed to present the civilian leadership with the full panoply of military options at the army's disposal.
Halutz already resigned a few months ago.
But both Olmert and Peretz have declared that, despite the Commission's conclusions, they would not quit: instead, they have vowed to implement the report's many far-reaching substantive recommendations about policy, strategy, and decision-making processes.
Will Olmert and Peretz be able to stay on?
Their coalition government enjoys a comfortable parliamentary majority; nor does the political arithmetic imply a viable parliamentary alternative.
But public opinion -- volatile and angry -- calls for both to resign: a public-opinion poll conducted after the Commission published its report indicated that only 14% of Israelis believe that Olmert should keep his job, while less than 11% support Peretz.
Later this week, demonstrations calling for the government's resignation are planned, and it will become obviously more difficult for the government to continue to function.
There are already rumors about a palace coup within Kadima, aimed at replacing Olmert with either the deputy prime minister, the veteran Shimon Peres, or the popular foreign minister, Tzipi Livni.
But it does not appear that Olmert will allow himself to be pushed out.
In fact, Olmert's weak and discredited government may yet survive.
If the government were to fall and new elections held, there are strong indications that the winner might be Binyamin Netanyahu, of the right-wing Likud, which was decimated in the 2006 elections, but is now patiently waiting in the wings.
Many who want Olmert to go would still not welcome a Netanyahu comeback, which may also explain what appears to be an indirect endorsement of Olmert by the United States.
Only a strong Israeli government can make the painful decisions necessary for negotiations with the Palestinians to succeed.
As a result, the prospects for meaningful continuation of Israeli-Palestinian talks look even dimmer than they did before.
Indeed, the real loser of the 2006 Lebanon war was neither Israel nor Hezbollah, but, at least for the time being, the peace process.
Palestine as a Failed State
Palestinians see their history as one of struggle against Zionism and Israel.
But the reality is more complicated, and marked by repeated failures to create a coherent body politic, even when historical opportunities beckoned.
Perhaps the first failure occurred in the 1920's, when the British Mandatory government in Palestine encouraged the two national communities -- Jewish and Arab -- to establish communal institutions of self-government to look after education, welfare, housing, and local administration.
The Jews -- then less than 20% of British Palestine's population -- set up what became known as the National Committee (Va'ad Leumi), based on an elected body, the Representative Assembly of Palestinian Jews.
Regular elections to this Assembly took place, sometimes with more than a dozen parties competing.
This autonomous institution became the forerunner of the political structure of the nascent Jewish state, and its leaders -- David Ben-Gurion among them -- emerged as Israel's future political elite.
Israel succeeded as a nation, with a vibrant and sometimes obstreperous parliamentary life, precisely because its leaders used this opportunity.
The Palestinians, however, never created similar embryonic state structures: an Arab Higher Committee was established, made up of regional and tribal notables, but no elections ever took place.
The Mufti of Jerusalem, Haj Amin al-Husseini (later an ally of Nazi Germany), became its chairman, but it never succeeded in creating a generally accepted national leadership or in providing the Arab community the panoply of educational and welfare services offered to the Jewish community by its elected institutions.
The second failure occurred during the Arab Revolt against British rule in Palestine in 1936-1939, which was accompanied by massive terror attacks against Jewish civilians.
The revolt itself was brutally suppressed by the British army, but not before a split within the Palestinian community resulted in two armed militias -- one based on the Husseini clan, the other on the more moderate Nashashibis -- that turned viciously on each other.
More Palestinians were killed by contending militias than by the British army or the Jewish self-defense forces.
The third failure -- even more tragic -- occurred in 1947-48, when Palestinian Arabs rejected the United Nations partition plan, which envisaged separate Arab and Jewish states after the departure of the British.
While Jews accepted this compromise, the Palestinian Arabs, supported by the Arab League countries, rejected it and went to war against the emerging State of Israel.
The Palestinian Arab defeat in this endeavor, and the resulting refugee problem, is a defining moment for Palestinians.
But what sometimes gets lost in this narrative is that, while practically all sectors of Palestinian Arab society rejected the UN plan, Palestinians were unable to devise coherent political institutions and a unified military command with which to confront the much smaller Jewish community.
By contrast, the besieged Jewish community, under David Ben-Gurion and the Jewish self-defense force (the Hagannah) was able to mobilize, through its democratic institutions and with only marginal dissent, the resources needed for a successful military campaign.
Indeed, many Palestinian political leaders absconded to Beirut or Cairo once violence broke out.
The Husseini clan set up its militia in the Jerusalem area.
Near Tel Aviv, in adjoining Jaffa, a competing militia under Hassan Salameh, took control.
In the north of the country, a Syrian-based militia, under Fawzi al-Kaukji, attacked Jewish villages.
The more moderate Haifa Arabs tried, not very successfully, to stay out of the fray.
Disunity made the Arab defeat almost inevitable.
Moreover, the scars of the 1930's virtual civil war have still not healed: mutual suspicion and memories of internecine massacres vitiated cooperation and trust.
The last failure occurred when the 1993 Oslo Accords between Israel and the PLO set up the autonomous Palestinian Authority under Yasser Arafat.
Instead of creating the infrastructure of the future Palestinian state, with various functions slowly transferred from the Israeli army to the Palestinian Authority, Arafat created a mukhabarat (security services) state, as in Egypt, Syria, and (until Saddam Hussein's fall) in Iraq.
Arafat and his Fatah-based supporters established almost a dozen competing security services -- sometimes indistinguishable from clan-based militias -- which consumed more than 60% the Palestinian Authority's budget, at the expense of education, housing, welfare, and refugee rehabilitation.
Into this vacuum burst Hamas, with its network of schools, welfare services, community centers, and support organizations.
The Hamas takeover of Gaza was but the latest step in this development.
It is easy to blame the current Palestinian crisis on individuals -- be it Arafat or Abbas.
It is even easier to blame the Israeli occupation or American policies.
To be sure, there is a lot of blame to go around.
But all national movements -- the Greek as well as the Polish, the Jewish as well as the Kurdish -- begin in adversity.
The Palestinians have a difficult history -- one of internal disunity and murderous internecine conflict -- to overcome.
They now stand again at a crossroads, and whether they will be able to transcend their tragic heritage depends on them.
No one can help them if they cannot come up with a coherent, consensual, and reasonably united leadership -- what Abbas himself calls "one law, one authority, one gun."
Impotent America?
There are immediate reasons why this is so: Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's government is weak and unpopular, mainly due to the botched 2006 war against Hezbollah in Lebanon.
The Palestinian Authority under Mahmoud Abbas is even weaker, having lost control of Gaza to Hamas after a violent putsch last year.
On the Palestinian side, this is part of a deeper phenomenon: a longstanding failure to create the institutional structures necessary for nation building.
For example, in 1936-1939, a Palestinian uprising against British rule deteriorated into a bloody civil war, in which more Palestinians were killed by their brethren than by the British army or the Jewish self-defense forces.
This is repeating itself now in Gaza.
Looking back at 60 years of American involvement in the region, one can discern two scenarios in which the United States can bring the local players to an agreement.
Absent these conditions, the US is ultimately powerless.
The first scenario is when a real war threatens to spill over into a wider conflict, destabilizing the region and Great Power relations.
At such times, resolute American steps can stop the fighting and impose a cease-fire, if not peace.
In 1973, at the end of the Yom Kippur War, Israel was poised to encircle the entire Egyptian Third Army in Sinai.
Its troops were on the road to Cairo, threatening to inflict a major defeat on Egypt.
A few tough messages from President Richard Nixon stopped the Israelis in their tracks and enabled the Americans to start a lengthy process of de-escalation that led to a number of interim agreements.
Likewise, in 1982, during the invasion of Lebanon, Israeli troops were about to enter Muslim West Beirut after Syrian agents assassinated the pro-Israeli Lebanese President-elect Bashir Gemayel.
This would probably have brought Syria into the war.
A few tough calls from President Ronald Reagan to Prime Minister Menachem Begin prevented this.
During the first Gulf War in 1991, when Iraq fired 39 Scud missiles at Israeli civilian targets and US forces failed to stop the Iraqi attacks, Israel was set to strike Iraqi targets, which would have split the US-Arab anti-Iraq coalition.
The US warned Israel not to get involved, and Israel was forced to comply.
In all these cases, American involvement was swift and focused on a clear aim, and compliance was verifiable within days, if not hours.
In such dramatic situations, US power is at its greatest.
The other scenario is when the two sides have already engaged in bilateral peace talks, paid the domestic political price, and reached agreement on most issues, though some matters remain unresolved and threaten to derail the process.
In such cases, America can step in and, by using both carrot and stick, make both sides go the extra mile.
After Anwar Sadat's visit to Jerusalem in 1977, Israel and Egypt negotiated for a year and reached agreement on most issues: peace, diplomatic relations, and full Israeli withdrawal from all occupied Egyptian territory in Sinai.
At this point, President Jimmy Carter -- who initially opposed the process -- invited both sides to Camp David to hammer out a peace treaty.
In 1993, in secret bilateral negotiations in Norway (unknown to the Americans), Israel and the PLO reached an agreement about mutual recognition and the creation of a provisional Palestinian Autonomous Authority.
Yet some issues remained unresolved.
President Bill Clinton stepped in, and prevailed upon the two sides to work out their remaining disagreements.
When either of these two scenarios is lacking, American initiatives are stillborn.
This happened to Clinton at Camp David in 2000, when he failed to bring Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat to an agreement, and to Bush's Road Map in 2003, when both sides agreed in principle to its general guidelines, but did little to implement them.
Absent local political will, and when confronted with a peace-making project that may take years to complete, the US is virtually powerless.
It is extremely successful as a fire brigade or as a midwife , but not as an initiator .
What applies to the US is even truer for the European Union, whose "soft power" is no match for its lack of local credibility.
The same dynamic can be seen elsewhere: for all its power, the US has failed to resolve the conflicts in Cyprus, Bosnia, or Kosovo.
The Annan Plan failed in Cyprus because of one party's opposition; progress now (the minor but symbolically important opening of the Ledra Street crossing in downtown Nicosia) reflects internal political changes on the Greek Cypriot side.
Similarly, if Belgrade will change its obstreperous position on Kosovo, this will be due not to US or EU pressure, but to internal political changes in Serbia.
Recognizing the limits of US power doesn't mean that America is irrelevant: it can stabilize a conflict, help bring about confidence-building measures, and negotiate interim agreements.
But at the end of the day, in the case of Israel-Palestine, as in any conflict between two national movements, the key is in the hands of the local players.
No national conflict has ever been solved by outside powers, however well intentioned they may be.
Building Palestine From the Bottom Up
The first obstacle -- indeed, the issue that stands front and center today -- is the ongoing Palestinian civil war, with Hamas controlling the Gaza Strip in defiance of Abu Mazen's Fatah-led Palestinian Authority.
The Palestinians' basic failure at nation-building makes any meaningful peace talks with Israel -- let alone an agreement --  almost impossible at the moment.
With Palestinians unable to agree among themselves on a minimal national consensus, how can peace be established between them and Israel?
Second, with Likud's Benjamin Netanyahu as prime minister, Israel now has a government which is far less likely to be willing -- or able -- to make major concessions and evacuate hundreds of thousands of Israeli settlers from the West Bank.
Third, and most significantly, the 1993 Israel-PLO agreement has until now failed to achieve its aim.
Attempts to revive the Oslo peace process -- the "Road Map" and the Annapolis process --  have similarly failed to achieve more than vacuous declarations and hollow photo opportunities.
The causes of these 15 years of failure should be considered, so that Mitchell's mission does not become another stillborn effort.
Both the Palestinians and Israel can easily and rightly be blamed for the failure of the Oslo process.
But there is a more fundamental cause at stake, and it should not be overlooked.
The Oslo process tried to build a Palestinian state from the top down: create a Palestinian national authority, hand over territory to it, give it increasing power, arm it and finance it, hold elections, and a Palestinian state would emerge.
Instead, the consequence was a corrupt, militarized Palestinian Authority, with competing security services proved incapable of providing security.
Nor could it conduct credible negotiations with Israel or deliver necessary services to ordinary Palestinians.
Two reasons for this failure stand out: the institutional weakness of Palestinian civil society, which lacks the infrastructure necessary for nation-building; and the impossibility of simultaneous nation-building and peace-making.
There is no precedent anywhere in the world that suggests that such a two-tier process can succeed.
A fundamental change of paradigm is needed: the effort should shift to building a Palestinian state from the bottom up, for which there are encouraging signs, even in the midst of the failure of the top-down process.
In the last two years, former British Prime Minister Tony Blair and US General Keith Dayton have succeeded in effective institution-building in three West Bank districts -- Jenin, Bethlehem, and Hebron -- turning them into the most peaceful areas in the West Bank, with a minimal Israeli military presence.
Local authorities were supplied with adequate funding and advice; independent chambers of commerce became the backbone of a local commercial middle class, which is interested in keeping the region peaceful, even absent an overall agreement; local police were trained (in Jordan), and now function effectively as police forces, not armed militias; and business relations with adjacent Israeli regions have been renewed.
This empowerment of an effective local leadership was done with much persistence -- and little fanfare. But these nuts-and-bolts projects created -- for the first time -- the building blocks necessary for effective Palestinian nation-building.
Admittedly, this process will take time and patience.
But, until now, it has been the only approach proven to succeed, while everything else has failed.
As Blair recently put it, such a bottom-up process may even go hand-in-hand with Netanyahu's goal of an "economic peace," though it would eventually have to go beyond it.
That such an approach would have to include a total halt to Israeli settlement activities goes without saying.
If carefully crafted, it may even be implicitly accepted, albeit without much enthusiasm, by the Israeli government.
The Oslo process has failed; an attempt to revive it -- say, by way of the Beirut Arab peace initiative -- will merely bring into the open all of the existing disagreements between the two sides, and will not overcome the Palestinian failure at nation-building.
After all the breakdowns in efforts to create a Palestinian state from the top down, only the old-fashioned way -- from the bottom up -- remains viable.
Let The Serbs Try Milosevic
A lot has been happening in Yugoslavia recently, much of it surprising.
After some procrastination and an initial failed attempt, Milosevic has been arrested, without bloodshed, though not without danger.
The peaceful vote in Montenegro last weekend may presage conflict and difficult decisions about independence, but chances are strong that the parties will settle these matters by talking rather than fighting.
These are great steps forward, and they show that despite brainwashing and the complicity of many Serbs in the crimes of the Milosevic regime, democracy and open society have a chance of taking root in what remains of Yugoslavia.
One key decision facing Serbia, and its new authorities, is whether Milosevic should be extradited to The Hague.
There seems to be almost universal agreement that he should, and international pressure is being applied on President Kostunica to comply.
But the decision may have life-and-death ramifications for Serbia's future.
Many who agree that Milosevic is a war criminal now think that we should listen to the voices coming from Belgrade and their cry that Milosevic should face trial before his own people.
Ultimate moral responsibility for what was done by Milosevic rests with Serbia's people.
They brought him to power, albeit not in a way that conforms precisely with democratic norms; they supported him, even when he led them into genocidal crimes and to defeat after defeat.
Finally, they brought him down, and the new democratic leadership in Belgrade has, at no little risk to its own position and standing, arrested him.
That arrest could well have ended in a bloodbath that might have destabilized a still insecure democratic government.
Yugoslavia's new leadership should now be allowed to deal with Milosevic in a way that promotes democracy within Yugoslavia.
His crimes should be judged by his own people -- not by an international tribunal.
In this way the trial will gain more legitimacy and credibility, especially among the many Serbs who still need to be educated in order to realize the true extent of Milosevic's crimes.
Most importantly, by dealing with Milosevic, the Serbs, many of whom supported his regime, will be forced to confront their own behavior and deal with their own consciences.
Only through this process will Serbia be able to rejoin the ranks of free and healthy European nations.
If the trial is held before distant judges, sitting in a far�away capital, applying a not very transparent and somehow abstract code of law, many Serbs will see this not as a trial of Milosevic, but as victors' justice meted out to the Serbian nation.
They will be wrong.
Nonetheless, political trials (and war crime trials are always political trials) must not only punish, but also teach.
The lessons from any trial of Milosevic should be taught to Serbia's citizens by Serbian judges, within a normative system that most Serbs accept as legitimate.
The international hue and cry for Milosevic to be brought to The Hague, regardless of political consequences, is understandable.
Yet this pressure is unwise, and somewhat hypocritical.
After all, the peacekeeping forces in Bosnia can, should they decide to act, arrest Radovan Karadzic and General Ratko Mladic, the leaders of the Bosnian Serbs who have been indicted by the Hague Tribunal.
They have not done so, and show no signs of doing so.
Why this inaction?
Clearly, political reasons are at the root of this: the British, US and French governments are reluctant to risk the lives of their own soldiers in order to bring these arch�criminals to justice.
Indeed, Karadzic and Mladic have evaded arrest for years; indeed, since the Dayton peace accords were signed.
Shouldn't equal consideration for the political constraints faced by President Kostunica and the sensitivities of the Serbian people be given?
Is it really worth the risk of destabilizing Yugoslavia's infant democracy to carry out trials that Yugoslavia's government shows every sign of being able to carry out?
That there will now be a Truth and Reconciliation Commission in Belgrade suggests that the current Yugoslav leadership understands that it needs to heal the wounds inflicted on its own people by the murderous Milosevic regime.
Let the international community show the same compassion and understanding to the Serbian people it applies when it has to decide whether to risk its own soldiers in an attempt to apprehend Karadzic and Mladic.
Are the Dollar's Days Numbered?
A year ago, the dollar bestrode the world like a colossus.
Now it is humbled and the euro looks triumphant.
Is the dollar on the way out as the world's unchallenged reserve and trade currency?
Or is "euro triumphalism" premature?
That question preoccupies not only speculators tracking the dollar's decline, but ordinary businessmen who wonder what currency to use when invoicing imports or exports.
Indeed, the part that currencies play in world trade through their role in invoicing receives too little attention.
Currently, the US dollar remains dominant.
Most US exports and imports are denominated in dollars, and the dollar is extensively used in trade that does not involve America.
Since 1980, however, the dollar has lost ground.
Estimates from the European Commission indicate that the dollar's share in world trade fell from 56% in 1980 to 52% in 1995 (the latest year for which statistics are available).
The Deutsche Mark's share remained relatively unchanged between 1980 and 1995.
The yen lags behind, but had the highest relative growth, with its share of world trade more than doubling from 2% in 1980 to almost 5% in 1995.
Among the reasons for the dollar's longtime dominance as the premier international currency are lower transactions costs in foreign exchange markets, the historical role of the dollar in world trade since 1945, and the sheer size of America's economy.
But the role of size is more complex than it seems.
The second biggest economy in the world is Japan's, but the fraction of its trade denominated in yen remains low, even when compared to the smallest European countries.
One factor that explains this is the large share of US firms in markets where Americans sell their goods.
To understand the reasons behind all this, consider what factors are in play when a firm chooses the currency it uses to invoice for goods.
Here an exporter faces two types of risk: price risk and competitiveness risk.
Consider a Japanese firm seeking to make the highest yen profits on goods sold in Switzerland.
If the Japanese firm sets the price in Swiss francs, it is exposed to price risk as the yen price will fluctuate with the yen-Swiss franc exchange rate.
This tends to make Japanese exporters prefer to price in yen.
But firms also care about what their competitors do.
If the Japanese firm sells its goods to a particular Swiss market dominated by Swiss firms (which invoice in Swiss francs), it would prefer to price in Swiss francs too.
If it priced in yen, it would risk losing its market share if the yen appreciated.
If Japanese firms are dominant in a particular Swiss market, they prefer to price in yen: a Japanese firm then would not have to worry about losing market share when the yen appreciated, because its competitors would face the same pressures.
These arguments explain the big role played by the dollar in trade.
The fact that the US is large makes it more likely that US firms are dominant in a particular market, either as an exporter or as import-competitors when foreign goods are sold in America.
This implies that US firms price in dollars, whether they sell at home or abroad, and foreign firms for competitive reasons will also price in dollars when they export to the US.
Because Japan has the second largest economy in the world, the yen should be a more important currency.
Competitiveness is a key reason for why it is not.
First, the US is Japan's largest trading partner: more than half of Japanese trade with industrialized countries is with the US.
Over 80% of Japanese exports to the US are priced in dollars, in markets where US firms tend to dominate.
Second, even when selling to countries other than the US, Japanese exporters often face stiff American competition.
Take Japanese exports to South East Asia, which are almost 50% denominated in dollars due to competition from US exporters.
These factors are unlikely to change soon and lead us to predict that the yen will keep a low profile in world trade.
They also explain why, over time, the euro should gain weight in international trade.
Euro-zone countries can be considered a single country when dealing with the currency denomination of trade.
This `country' has more market power than the individual countries that form the European Monetary Union.
So the euro should play a larger role in international trade in the future than the sum of the currencies it replaced.
Yet these changes will only occur gradually.
So the "euro triumphalism" that has greeted the dollar's decline is, indeed, premature.
Despite its current distress, the dollar should retain its predominance for some time to come.
European Discrimination on Trial
All European states are members of the Council of Europe, all have signed the European Convention on Human Rights, 39 of the 46 member states have adopted the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities, and 14 have ratified Protocol 12 on the prohibition against discrimination.
Nevertheless, the living conditions of many Roma remain appalling.
Although recent reports published in 2006 by the European Union's Monitoring Center on Racism and Xenophobia and the Council of Europe's Human Rights Commissioner note some improvements, they indicate Roma living conditions have stagnated, if not deteriorated.
Roma are still victims of discrimination in access to housing, employment, healthcare, and education, despite significant local efforts at the Council of Europe's instigation and with its support.
Discrimination in educational access is particularly important, given its profound effect on its victims' life prospects.
In the most extreme cases, the education system itself is segregated: isolated schools in remote camps; special classes for Roma children in mainstream schools; and an over-representation of Roma children in classes for children with learning difficulties.
The EHCR was confronted with the third issue in the case D.H. and others vs. Czech Republic .
The Court was referred to 18 cases of girls and boys who, between 1996 and 1999, were placed in special schools for children with learning difficulties, either directly or after a period of time in primary schools.
The question was whether the children were victims of discrimination owing to their national minority status.
The Czech government admitted that some of the special schools' student bodies comprised 80% to 90% Roma children.
However, if there was discrimination, it was not direct, because under Czech law, such a move could be decided only by a school headmaster based on the results of an intelligence test at an educational psychology counseling centre, and subject to the approval of the child's parents or legal guardian.
A difference in treatment is not discriminatory in itself.
According to the case law of national supreme courts and the ECHR, discrimination exists only when people in a similar situation are treated differently.
Yet national and international case law recognizes that a non-discriminatory measure in theory can be discriminatory in practice.
So, in the current case, the alleged discrimination does not stem from the law itself, but from its effects, with the plaintiffs relying mainly on statistics showing the over-representation of Roma in special schools.
Many other reports on the situation of Roma in the Czech Republic, including by the Council of Europe, are available.
But, as the Court rightly noted, it should rule only on the cases to which it is referred, and should not make known its opinion on the Czech education system's legitimacy, as choices concerning educational opportunities fall under the jurisdiction of states and therefore can vary accordingly.
Working on this assumption and given the case it had to solve, an EHCR panel of seven judges ruled against the plaintiffs in February 2006, concluding that the law on special schools is not aimed specifically at Roma and does not apply only to them.
According to the Court, the law's legitimate purpose is to adapt teaching to the difficulties of a specific category of pupils, and psychological tests seem to be objective enough not to be suspected of racial bias.
Moreover, the requirement of parents' approval for placing children in special schools remains valid, while Roma children who were initially placed in those schools could have returned to mainstream schools later, and thus reintegrated into normal schooling.
As well-founded as the Court's reasoning may be, a feeling of unease persists.
The statistics showing the enormous proportion of Roma children in those schools are hard to ignore, and the suspicion of discrimination is difficult to avoid.
While laws have changed, mentalities do not always follow at the same pace, and we intuitively know that it is easy to get psychology to mean a lot of things.
Indeed, before announcing its decision, the Court felt it necessary to state that while it did not conclude that the Convention had been violated, statistics still revealed "worrying figures, and the situation in general in the Czech Republic regarding Roma children's education needs to be improved."
The Court's president, Jean-Paul Costa, expressed a similar view, without questioning the legitimacy of the decision, although Judge Cabral Barreto wrote a dissenting opinion.
Moreover, it is significant that the Court agreed, at the request of the parties, to refer the case on appeal to its Grand Chamber.
According to Costa, rejecting the ruling in February 2006 would contradict previous case law.
Will the Court, then, decide on the workings of the Czech education system itself?
Or will it follow Judge Barreto, who calls for recognition of an obligation to adopt affirmative action policies aimed at benefiting Romanies?
Whatever formula is adopted, it is certain that Roma children should be afforded the same opportunities as other children.
It is this imperative that underlies the importance of the coming decision, for it provides an occasion for the Court to reassert the fundamental principle of non-discrimination that defines our democratic societies.
The IMF as Global Financial Anchor
The IMF can play an important role in this regard, owing to its truly global perspective -- one that encompasses both advanced economies and emerging and developing economies, which are increasingly integrating into the global financial system.
Moreover, the IMF does not focus on financial markets per se , but has unique expertise on the linkages between the real and financial economy.
Finally, the IMF's perspective is universal, looking across sectors and markets.
So far, the Fund has not fully exploited its unique position, because it has often been passive in reaching out, giving clear messages, and making recommendations to its members.
But the current financial market turmoil has shown that there are regulatory and supervisory gaps and poorly understood international linkages that call for a global response.
We believe that the IMF needs to move decisively on financial stability issues and be more proactive to help prevent and mitigate future crises.
The IMF should work closely with the Financial Stability Forum, the Bank for International Settlements and other relevant international bodies.
To strengthen the Fund's financial stability role, we propose action in three related areas.
First, the IMF should promote financial stability through multilateral surveillance.
It should be positioned at the center of international financial markets and provide an analytical platform, not only for central banks and finance ministries, but also for regulators, standard setters, and market participants.
In particular, the Fund should enhance its understanding of the links between supervisory frameworks and macroeconomic conditions, including balance-of-payments and exchange-rate developments, by leveraging the wealth of cross-country information and expertise that it acquires through missions to its 185 members.
This would enable it to identify macroeconomic threats to stability and encourage best practices for supervisors and regulators.
Building on its research, the IMF could contribute more to the debate on the macroeconomic and financial implications of private equity, hedge funds, and sovereign wealth funds, and develop practical recommendations to enhance their contribution to international financial stability.
Second, the IMF should promote financial stability through bilateral surveillance.
It needs to rethink how to address financial stability in its day-to-day work with members.
Financial sector analysis should become fully integrated into the IMF's surveillance activities.
The IMF should also be more proactive and speak with greater candor in systemically important countries, where shortcomings in financial supervision and crisis management have appeared.
It should assist emerging economies in shaping sound domestic financial markets.
These steps would require the IMF mission teams to become more diverse, bringing financial sector expertise in addition to the traditional macro and fiscal skills.
The Fund needs to hire more financial sector experts, relying less on academic professionals.
Third, the Fund should assist members who have well-defined programs for liberalizing and integrating their economy into the global financial system.
It should consider developing appropriate liquidity instruments to give confidence to emerging market economies that may be affected by a crisis beyond their control, rather than forcing them to build up ever-larger reserves or resort to regional arrangements for self-insurance.
Action in these three areas would help to create a multilateral institution with the authority and expertise to advise countries on supervisory and regulatory issues of systemic importance.
The current turmoil highlights the international financial system's need for such an institution.
The members that we represent -- advanced and emerging countries in Asia and Europe -- want to play a role in re-establishing a strengthened IMF at the heart of the international monetary system. 
The New IMF
The IMF is well-positioned to help its members overcome the financing gaps resulting from the crisis.
In the run-up to the G20 summit access to the Fund's credit facilities was increased and policy conditions were streamlined.
In a watershed with former practice, a new non-conditional credit line was introduced for well-performing countries.
Mexico and Poland will be its first users and more countries will line up.
These more flexible lending policies reflect a new image of the IMF.
The negative stigma attached to IMF financing is a thing of the past.
Its financing role in this crisis secured, the IMF now needs to strengthen its position as guardian of an open international financial system.
The IMF was created to prevent crises like the current one and in this it has failed.
Admittedly, there were warnings, but policy makers, particularly in advanced countries, did not follow suit.
The ‘new' IMF should be an institution that communicates better with its members, balances the interests of its advanced, emerging and developing members in an evenhanded manner, and aligns its policies better to the needs of the moment.
Now that the IMF has been given a second lifetime, it needs to regain its central position in the international financial system.
For this, it needs to focus on three issues: improved surveillance of financial stability, strengthened international coordination, and an updated decision-making process.
The new IMF needs to become more vocal on global financial stability issues.
The IMF should see to it that there are no gaps in the surveillance of financial institutions.
It can help shape a more robust global supervisory system which needs to be built in order to preserve the benefits of global financial markets.
And it should help develop a vision on what the future financial landscape should look like.
To this end IMF surveillance should include regular updates on supervisory regimes in systemically important countries.
Early warnings, commissioned by the G20, should be specific and the IMF should monitor whether policymakers give follow-up to the Fund's advice.
The new IMF needs to take a fresh look at international policy coordination.
The demand for a different monetary order, as advocated by China, sets the stage for a renewed effort to avoid the international imbalances which were at the root of this crisis.
First, the US saving deficit will need to be addressed in a sustainable manner.
Second, China will have to make its currency convertible.
Third, the position of the euro will strengthen over time as more countries will join the euro zone.
With more key currencies in place, the perspective of a truly multipolar currency system comes in sight, with an increased role for the SDR.
This will lessen the need felt by emerging economies for self-insurance against financial instability, by building up large reserves.
Finally, the new IMF needs governance structures that better reflect today's new global realities.
The perception that advanced countries are running business in the Fund, but do not adhere to Fund advice, has undermined the IMF's authority.
The G20 summit marked the return of the United States to multilateralism.
This acceptance of collective responsibility should come with abandoning US veto power in the IMF by lowering required voting majorities, as well as abandoning Europe's prerogative of appointing the Managing Director.
One of the strengths of the IMF's present governance structure, the constituency system, should be duplicated at the G20 as well, so as to ensure inclusiveness.
The rapid growth of China, India, and other emerging countries should come with increased influence, to be implemented through the planned quota increase in 2011.
Advanced countries, including European countries, will see a relative decrease in voting power.
An increased say for emerging economies will imply taking more international responsibility as well, also in financial terms.
Now European countries finance 42% of IMF lending and 62% of concessional World Bank lending.
This task will have to be shared by emerging countries with large reserves.
These reserves are put to better use by assisting the IMF in maintaining an open and stable financial system and prevent crises like these from recurring
Why Wait for the Euro?
Although the EU's eastward enlargement has not yet happened, the debate is already shifting to ask what will follow: when should the new, predominantly postcommunist, members adopt the euro?
At the outset, it must be stressed that, in seeking earlier entry into the EMU a country assumes a more ambitious fiscal and structural program than would be needed if EMU membership is delayed.
Early entry, otherwise, would be an empty gesture.
I believe that early adoption of the euro is not only possible, but preferable to delay.
By early adoption I mean the shortest permissible period of time - two years - following a new member subordinating its monetary policy to the fiscal and monetary constraints of the exchange rate mechanism (ERM II).
Assuming entry into both the EU and ERM II in 2004, new members should aim to enter the eurozone around 2006.
Is this realistic?
Well, most candidate countries have already achieved a high degree of structural convergence with the EU.
Exports to the Union have soared since 1991, when the collapse of the Soviet-era COMECON trading system forced a radical reorientation of trade - helped by massive foreign investment from the EU - towards Western markets.
Most accession candidates now send more exports to the EU than Greece, Portugal, and Spain did when they entered the EU and EMU.
Progress on disinflation is similarly impressive.
Annual inflation in most candidate countries has fallen to 4-5% - not much higher than in many EU countries, and lower than in The Netherlands last year.
As with structural convergence, EU candidates already outperform Spain, Portugal, and Greece at a comparable time before their EMU debut.
Nor is there much risk of large, future corrective price swings because all but a few prices are completely liberalized.
Theoretical studies suggest that inflation in the accession countries will remain stubbornly higher than the Maastricht Treaty allows.
This overall rise in real wages in the face of lower productivity growth for the service sector boosts relative prices and keeps inflation above the eurozone average.
The Balassa-Samuelson effect is still evident in Greece, Spain and Portugal.
With the Balassa-Samuelson effect so subdued and limited scope for future corrective inflation, the EMU criterion regarding price stability - of annual inflation within 1.5% of the average rate for the three best-performing economies in the EU - is within reach.
But is early admission to EMU preferable to postponing membership?
From the standpoint of current member states, would admitting Hungary, Latvia, Poland, or Slovakia, sooner rather than later, drag down the euro as many fear?
Fears that extending EMU to new states "too soon" would undermine the euro's external exchange rate are irrational.
If all candidate countries join the EU at around the same time, they will together account for a mere 6% of its total GDP.
So any negative impact on the euro from rapid accession to EMU would at worst amount to little more than a rounding error.
Delaying entry into EMU could make sense if a longer wait produced more information.
But a wait of greater length might produce nothing but added noise.
Equally, the transition period is already turbulent, with convergence-driven capital flows driving up exchange rates and complicating monetary policy in several candidate countries, including Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary.
Indeed, capital-flow volatility could make short work of the flexible exchange rate on offer under ERM II - a 15% fluctuation band either side of a central parity.
Some argue that ERM II membership should be viewed as a longer-term proposition - possibly lasting until 2010 - for the benefit of candidates themselves.
The benefit is simple: ERM II permits some exchange rate flexibility, as opposed to the fixed rates implied by adopting the euro.
This would help keep the candidates' economic output high and thus sustain real convergence with average EU income levels.
This is an exceptionally weak argument, and a politically suspect one, too.
As European Central Bank data shows, average per capita GDP in the accession candidates is 44% of the eurozone level.
The size of the income gap combines with the small growth differentials to imply that the process of real convergence will extend far beyond even the most cautious dates for EU and EMU entry, probably lasting several decades.
More important, long-lasting economic growth does not depend on the type of exchange rate - whether flexible or fixed (EMU) - while early accession will speed up crucial reforms.
A few years of limited exchange rate flexibility is a poor substitute for rapid completion of structural reforms.
In almost all candidates, further disinflation and long-term economic growth require fiscal consolidation, more flexible labor markets, and completion of privatization.
Delaying EMU entry risks weakening the incentive to complete these politically costly but necessary reforms.
Any delay in completing reforms will ultimately slow the process of real convergence that EU officials rightly hold dear.
Early adoption, by contrast, would be more conducive to these reforms, and thus to real convergence.
Success here would allow candidate countries to start reaping the benefits of greater price transparency, reduced transaction costs, and a solid macroeconomic framework.
This strategy, not one of deferred entry, promises the most for both the EU's current and its future members.
Liberty's Revolutionary Muse
For decades, Friedman remained stranded in the intellectual wilderness, spurning the postwar Keynesian consensus that governments should use fiscal policy to manage aggregate demand -- a view that sustained statist economic policies through the 1970's.
Indeed, in the context of his age, Friedman was a true intellectual revolutionary, combining rigorous academic research and gracefully written popular books and journalism to argue for free-market policies -- and to affirm the link, defended by writers from Adam Smith to Friedrich von Hayek, between economic freedom and political liberty.
In economics, Friedman revived and developed the monetarist theory that the quantity of money in circulation is the main determinant of how economies perform.
In his masterpiece A Monetary History of the United States, 1867-1960 (written with Anna Schwartz), he famously attributed recessions, including the Great Depression of the 1930's, to a decline in the money supply.
Likewise, he argued that it was an oversupply of money that caused inflation.
In the 1960's, Friedman showed that Keynesian demand management through government spending constantly increased the money supply, accelerating wage and price growth.
Together with Edmund Phelps -- this year's Nobel Prize laureate -- he proved that there is no stable tradeoff between unemployment and inflation.
Any attempt to use expansionary government policies to drive unemployment below a certain level, they demonstrated, would fuel inflationary expectations and undermine both economic growth and employment.
That analysis both anticipated and explained the combination of rising inflation and rising unemployment of the 1970's that came to be known as "stagflation."
Friedman was the catalyst for a profound shift in how governments conduct economic policy.
Rather than fiscal stimulation and control, the main tool of economic management nowadays is monetary policies conducted by independent central banks.
Keynesian demand management was thus displaced by a new understanding -- which we owe largely to Friedman -- that pursuing fiscal discipline and price stability is the best guarantee of macroeconomic sustainability.
Equally important were Friedman's contributions to influencing public opinion through works that addressed the role of the state in society.
Alongside Hayek, his colleague at the University of Chicago, Friedman launched a more general intellectual assault on Keynesianism, arguing that any government permitted to regulate the economy in the name of equality posed a threat to individual liberty.
In his Newsweek columns published between 1966 and 1983, and in his books Capitalism and Freedom , Free to Choose , and The Tyranny of the Status Quo (written with his wife, Rose), Friedman offered a vision of liberty that was both appealing and achievable.
Indeed, Free to Choose -- later the basis of a popular television series that he hosted -- was published illegally in Poland in the 1980's, helping to inspire me, and many others, to dream of a future of freedom during the darkest years of communist rule.
With remarkable clarity, his popular writings advanced a compelling political philosophy, together with concrete policy proposals.
For example, he pioneered the idea of school vouchers, arguing that private competition would ensure better educational performance than government systems.
Friedman's views made him a guiding light for economic conservatives worldwide.
His influence on Margaret Thatcher's government helped transform Britain from a post-industrial basket case dominated by class struggle into Europe's dominant economic power.
When Vietnam launched free-market reforms in the 1980's, senior government officials pored over his writings.
He also initiated the now common practice of measuring and comparing political and economic freedom across countries, helping to shape opinion in countries that are viewed as limiting freedom.
But Friedman's consistent anti-statism also led him to embrace positions that ran afoul of many conservatives' political sensibilities, underscoring the intellectual honesty that was the hallmark of his career.
For example, his opposition to governments' authority to prohibit or regulate human behavior extended to licensing requirements for doctors and car drivers, as well as to anti-drug laws, which he believed operated as a subsidy to organized crime.
Likewise, he expended considerable effort agitating against America's military draft.
Although he did not win all his intellectual battles, rarely can it be said with as much certainty that a man was great, and that the work that he has left behind will retain enduring influence.
I live in a Poland that is now free, and I consider Milton Friedman to be one of the main intellectual architects of our liberty.
How Can the New Members Catch Up?
Of the ten new EU member states, eight have undergone a transformation whose speed and scope has been unprecedented.
Wherever one looks in the postcommunist accession countries ­­- at money, markets, ownership structures, banking sectors, foreign trade, health care, environmental protection, and education - one sees institutions that have been reconstructed from the ground up.
In many of the transition countries, inflation was brought down from majestic heights - 251% in Poland in 1989 - and all now have fully convertible currencies.
Private enterprise dominates production and employment, whereas it accounted for only 23.1% of GDP in Poland in 1989 and just 4% in the Czech Republic and Slovakia.
Similarly, after the collapse of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (COMECON) in 1991, the transition countries quickly redirected their foreign trade to the West.
Educational opportunities have multiplied, air and water pollution have plummeted, and life expectancy has increased almost to West European levels across the region.
Since the early 1990's, the prospect of eventual admission to the EU has helped spur these institutional changes.
But now the task for the new member states - which account for 20% of the enlarged EU's population but only 5% of its GDP - is no less difficult: to achieve the rapid catch-up growth rates needed to close the economic gap with the EU's leaders.
Membership itself will certainly help.
Increased policy credibility will boost inflows of foreign direct investment (FDI), while EU structural funds will support further institution building, infrastructure investment, and environmental protection.
There is little empirical doubt about the positive impact of FDI inflows.
FDI promotes technology transfer and contributes relatively more to economic growth than domestic investment, because it increases total investment in the economy more than one for one, owing to complementarities with domestic firms.
Empirical research also confirms the positive impact of EU structural funds on growth.
EU structural assistance has increased annual GDP growth, on average, by 0.4-0.9% in Greece, Portugal and Ireland, and by 0.3 to 0.5% in Spain, thereby helping poorer countries catch up with richer member states.
EU membership provides the opportunity to catch up, but the actual economic outcomes will depend on the quality of domestic policies - and whether the EU policies most conducive to economic growth are strengthened, not weakened.
This implies several imperatives for the EU and the new member countries alike.
Moreover, fiscal deficits and inflation squeeze out investment and limit productivity gains.
Strengthen single-market policies.
The benefits of the single market are evident, not least by creating a much more attractive location for foreign investors.
Surveys indicate that the internal market has helped more than 60% of companies that export to more than five EU countries boost their cross-border sales, and that 80% of consumers believe that the range of goods has increased, while 67% say that their quality has improved.
Cross-border trade in goods has grown by around a third since the creation of the Internal Market in 1992 due to two principles: mutual recognition, which allows companies to apply their own national rules, and EU directives that harmonize national rules.
But mutual recognition does not work well for relatively more complex products, and EU directives affecting items like construction products, machinery, and pressure equipment have been problematic to implement.
Pre-tax prices of new cars can differ up to 70% between member states due in large part to regulations that suppress competition.
Services are even more susceptible than goods to internal market barriers.
For example, a new directive requires non-household customers to be able to choose their electricity supplier by July 2004 and their gas supplier by July 2007.
But the directive ignores household customers, who in 2001 were able to choose their electricity supplier in only five EU States and their gas supplier in only three.
As for labor mobility, practice has yet to catch up with theory.
In 1992-2002, only 4% of the total EU population moved across borders either to work or to retire.
During this period, only 8% of EU students completed part of their studies in another member state.
Integration of EU financial markets - launched in 1999 with the adoption of the Financial Services Action Plan (FSAP) - also needs to accelerate.
According to the European Commission, creating a single European capital market would reduce the cost of equity capital for EU businesses by 0.5% and lower the cost of corporate debt financing by 0.4%.
It would also boost GDP in the EU-15 over ten years by about 1.1% and raise employment by 0.5%.
But, by 2002, only 31 of the FSAP's 42 provisions had been implemented.
Target early EMU entry. Entry into the euro as soon as possible is the best strategy for the accession countries, because it will mobilize them to complete structural reforms in order to meet the Maastricht criteria for inflation, interest rates, fiscal deficits, and public debt.
This would have obvious benefits for long-term economic growth, as would elimination of exchange-rate risks, hedging costs, and transaction costs in foreign trade.
The accession countries are already highly integrated with the EU economy, with pronounced cyclical convergence between the accession countries and the EMU countries.
Continuing EU integration is likely to align the business cycles of these countries in a manner similar to the synchronization of supply and demand shocks in the EU in the 1990's.
Thus, costs associated with giving up an independent monetary policy and a flexible exchange rate would not be significant.
In each of these areas, the Union's new members still face a difficult path to full integration.
In many of them, so does the EU.
Lessons from the Kaczyński's Poland
Many governments waste good economic times by postponing the reforms needed to build a prosperous future.
The PiS-led government, elected in 2005, inherited a fast-growing economy, but did nothing to strengthen that legacy.
Instead, privatization was blocked, while fiscal reforms and deregulation remained paper proposals.
Indeed, the Kaczyński government embarked on a program of anti-reform.
The separation of powers (an independent judiciary and central bank) was undermined in favor of a "strong" state.
The PiS captured the public media, the general prosecutor's office was politicized, and, with the use of the media, was turned into a tool of party propaganda aimed at showing that Poland was ruled by malicious hidden forces, known as the układ , which cheated Poles and kept them poor.
Anyone who disagreed with this diagnosis or criticized the PiS's methods, particularly those used by its leader, Jarosław Kaczyński, was promptly classified as belonging to the układ .
No one was spared.
Indeed, Lech Wałęsa and Władysław Bartoszewski, the Polish Mandela, were ruthlessly attacked.
Contrary to popular cliché, PiS's victory in 2005 did not result from "reform fatigue," since there were not many reforms implemented in 2000-2005 (except for an ambitious but partially blocked attempt at fiscal consolidation).
This explanation seems dubious elsewhere, too.
In Slovakia, the reformist leader Mikuláš Dzurinda won the 1998 elections after having implemented a tough stabilization program, and he could have continued to govern after the 2006 elections if not for disagreements in his coalition.
In the Czech Republic, a reformist government was elected in 2006, and in Hungary, political divisions rather than reform fatigue dominates electoral campaigns.
Of course, it is not easy for reformers to win elections.
On the contrary, reforms usually are undertaken only when the signs of an impending crisis are so strong that it is increasingly difficult to ignore them, or after the crisis has already "educated" voters.
(However, if the crisis follows reforms, populist politicians may win by blaming the reforms, instead of their incomplete nature, as in Argentina.)
Reformers can win elections if they are better at public communication than the populists.
Bad policies are, more often than not, easier to sell than good ones.
In Poland in 2005, the issue was mainly corruption.
The PiS jumped on the anticorruption bandwagon and strengthened its appeal by linking the fight against corruption to the vision of hidden forces supposedly perverting Polish society and democracy.
If not for that, the results of the 2005 elections would most likely have been quite different.
To criticize anticorruption campaigns is risky, because words can be twisted to imply indifference.
Therefore, let me first present my anticorruption credentials: as Deputy Prime Minister in 1999 I was the first Polish politician to ask the World Bank to prepare a report on corruption in Poland and ways to eradicate it.
In my public life, I emphasized eliminating discretionary regulations -- the main source of both inefficiency and corruption.
But we should not be blind to what can happen when political demagogues hijack the anticorruption card.
Interestingly, all the available measures of actual corruption were already declining before the Kaczyński twins were elected.
For example, the index of the frequency of paying bribes, calculated by the World Bank and EBRD, was 2.7 in 1999 and 2.03 in 2005 (the value of 1 is the minimum).
The corruption tax (the percentage of sales paid in bribes) declined from 1.22% in 2002 to 0.7% in 2005.
Poland now has a huge gap between the levels of perceived and actual corruption.
On perception, it fares much worse than Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Greece, while it fares better -- or at least not worse -- on indicators of actual corruption.
For example, the percentage of respondents admitting to paying bribes in 2006 was 5% in Poland and 17% in the Czech Republic and Greece.
The index of the frequency of paying bribes in 2005 was 2.03 in Poland, 2.22 in Slovakia, 2.09 in the Czech Republic, and 2.37 in Greece.
The corruption tax in 2005 was 0.7% in Poland, 0.93% in Slovakia, and 0.63% in Hungary.
Of course, Poles should not settle for today's levels of corruption.
Instead, the battle with corruption should aim at removing its root causes: the scope of the discretionary public sector and the suppression of market forces.
This is the only path that promises both less corruption and more economic growth.
Combating corruption through increased punitive action, while leaving intact a bloated and discretionary public sector, will only paralyze public officials, delay important decisions, and play into the hands of cynical demagogues and political fanatics.
The Fusion Myth
In the fission reactions that nuclear power generation relies on today, heavy elements such as uranium break into smaller ones, while in nuclear fusion small elements such as hydrogen stick together and form heavier elements (helium).
Both fission and fusion produce a lot of energy.
Some political leaders explain that nuclear fusion is at work in the sun, and that, thanks to ITER, we will harness it.
They often add that, since fusion burns hydrogen, which can be found in seawater, it is an infinite source of energy.
Unfortunately, political leaders know little about the scientific issues involved.
That nuclear fusion is a source of energy has been known since the invention of the hydrogen bomb.
But its control is still a fundamental challenge for research institutes, not some minor technical difficulty that can be easily overcome.
Confining a little sun inside a box is an extremely difficult task for three main reasons.
First, the nuclear fuel is not seawater, but a mixture of the two heavy isotopes of hydrogen, deuterium and tritium, a radioactive element that has been produced in small quantities for hydrogen bombs.
Any development of fusion reactors would require producing tritium with industrial methods that have yet to be invented.
Second, the deuterium-tritium fusion reaction starts at around 100 million degrees.
To achieve this requires using a magnet to accelerate a plasma that is a big flame of deuterium and tritium nuclei.
This must be done in a ultra-high vacuum in a large chamber.
ITER is not designed to produce electricity, but to study the stability of the flame in the magnet.
Since the fusion reactions produce alpha particles, which pollute the plasma, one has to insert a "divertor" inside the flame at 100 million degrees in order to clean it.
Nobody has ever accomplished this, but ITER may be able to try around 2030 -- that is, if it solves the previous problem.
Third, fusion also emits neutrons that will produce helium gas bubbles inside the wall material, which tends to explode.
The supporters of ITER explain that if the walls are porous, the bubbles can escape.
But nothing can be both leak-proof and porous, and ITER is not designed to study this contradiction.
In the future, a "blanket" should be inserted between the plasma and the walls, with two objectives: to protect the outer walls and to produce tritium from nuclear reactions within a circulating fluid containing lithium.
This might work, but the first wall of the blanket will need to be not only leak-proof and porous, but also sufficiently permeable to neutrons, which have to hit the lithium atoms beyond it.
The problem of materials is an entire research field in itself.
In order to study it, it has been decided to build the International Fusion Materials Irradiation Facility (IFMIF) in Japan.
Some scientists have argued that the neutron irradiation in IFMIF won't be the same as in fusion reactors, but it should be noted that its cost, at one billion euros, will be one-tenth that of ITER.
So why can't we wait for IFMIF's results before building ITER?
It all depends on one's budget.
If ITER could really solve the planet's energy problem, €10 billion would be a negligible investment -- less than the net profit of the oil company TOTAL (€13 billion in 2006) and equivalent to ten days of waging the war in Iraq.
But if fusion is ever to work in industrial power stations, it will take many decades.
Even if ITER is successful, and if one solves the tritium and material problems, everything would need to be tested in real size, and only then could a first prototype of an industrial reactor be built.
A drastic reduction of CO2 emissions is an urgent priority, but fusion is unlikely to produce sufficient energy to achieve that goal before the twenty-second century.
In fact, ITER is a big instrument for fundamental research, so its €500 million Euros annual cost needs to be compared with similar scientific initiatives, such as the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN), which costs one billion Swiss francs per year.
In my opinion, searching for the fundamental structure of particles is far more important than studying the stability of a plasma.
In France, the contribution to ITER is more than all the available funding for research projects in all our physics laboratories.
So the danger is that ITER will squeeze out funding for other vital research.
We already have the bad example of the International Space Station, a waste of $100 billion that has produced no scientific results.
ITER will not solve our energy problem.
Although it has some scientific interest in plasma physics, the participating countries should clearly state that funding it won't affect the rest of their research efforts.
At the same time, the international community should support research on energy saving and storage, and accelerate the development of fourth-generation nuclear reactors, which will use fission and be both clean and durable.
Europe's Unity in European Values
Alongside the debate about the European Union constitution, a debate about European values has also developed.
This debate is important not only for implanting meaning in the constitution, but will also determine the vitality and energy of the EU itself.
The EU, being the product of several great religious and philosophical traditions, is a community of values.
The ideas of the Greeks and Romans, Christianity, Judaism, humanism, and the Enlightenment have made us who we are.
Dialogue with Islamic and Arabic cultures also helped form our identity.
The pattern of our values has been woven over hundreds of years.
Europe is the continent of Michelangelo and Montesquieu, but also of the guillotine and the gas chamber.
Indeed, the bitter experience WWII taught Europeans how fundamental is the importance of shared values.
In an impoverished, war-ravaged Europe, people yearned for peace, freedom, stability, and a new chance to prosper.
The architects of European integration - Monnet, Schuman, Adenauer, De Gasperi, and others - understood that these ideals could be achieved only by combining and interweaving the practical interests of Europe's countries.
They built their fragile house of peace on a foundation of coal and steel.
The founders passed the torch on to the generation of Jacques Delors, Helmut Kohl, François Mitterrand, Václav Havel, Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, and others.
They broadened and deepened European cooperation.
Their leadership made it possible for Europe to make great strides towards its post-war ideals - peace, stability, and prosperity.
We now stand at the threshold of a new phase of European cooperation.
In late October, the EU's Constitutional Treaty will be signed.
A new generation of politicians is ready to carry the torch onwards.
But is the torch still burning bright?
In the early 1950s, Jean Monnet wrote: "We are not forming a coalition of states.
We are uniting people."
Apparently not.
As the Union races ahead, it seems that it has lost Europe's citizens along the way.
Many are turning their backs on the whole project.
They have trouble seeing what is common to Europe.
They do not feel part of the great whole.
Even in the new member states, enthusiasm for the European family of democracies is cooling.
We have achieved a united Europe without uniting Europeans.
Today's post-war generations, lacking direct memory of WWII, view Europe's great achievements - liberty, peace, and prosperity - as a given.
The idea of Europe as a heritage and a mission does not mean much.
But, without ideals, Europe's foundations will erode.
The emphasis on pure self-interest increases this threat.
My generation grew up with the image of Europe as an economic form of cooperation.
Political motives behind European integration were overshadowed by the economic project.
The result is an impression of Europe as a marketplace.
A Europe of markets and money, not of man and morals, dominated the project.
But without a moral foundation, there can be no free-market economy.
Today, we are paying the price for not attending to Europe's shared values and common mission. Until Europeans know precisely what Europe stands for, what inspires and motivates us, the Union will not be able to take joint action in the world.
The EU Constitution will make Europe more democratic and more transparent.
It provides further guarantees that decisions will be taken by those closest to citizens, and it acknowledges the significance the values on which the Union rests: respect for human rights and dignity, liberty, democracy, equality, and the rule of law.
These shared values are the glue that binds governments together in the recognition that clinging to pure self-interest is no longer reasonable when common concerns call for a common strategy.
For what is the point of doing away with Europe's physical borders if borders between its citizens remain?
How can Europeans be happy that the Iron Curtain is gone if individuals and groups across the Union barricade themselves behind private iron curtains?
Indeed, fear, insecurity, and nationalism are again raising their heads.
It is important for Europeans to reflect on that as they prepare for further rounds of enlargement and consider starting accession negotiations with Turkey.
The preamble of the Constitution states that Europe is "united in its diversity."
This may be the most concise statement of what makes Europe Europe.
But the words "united in diversity" raise the question of where this unity lies.
The answer lies in the values on which the Union is based.
They are contained in three concepts: freedom, solidarity, and mutual respect.
These three together make it possible for Europe to open its doors to a great diversity of peoples and at the same time to speak as a community of peoples prepared to take responsibility for one another.
Making such a community a reality will not come about by believing that Europe's culture is better than others.
We will make it a reality through dialogue and deep reflection about Europe's common values.
Values must be the road that leads to what cannot be reached by markets and institutions alone - the accession of Europe's citizens to the European Union.
Only by embracing their shared values can Europeans prevent their Union from becoming a spiritless machine.
Together, Europeans must find what connects them, and derive new enthusiasm, new spirit from what they find - a spirit sorely needed to tackle the great issues of today.
No country can address these issues along.
After more than fifty years, Europe as a community of values remains as necessary as ever.
Europe's New Dawn
Today in Rome, the heads of state and government of the EU's 25 member states will sign the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe.
We have come a long way since the six founding members formed the European Economic Community back in March 1957 - also in Rome.
After the Treaty is signed, it will go before the national parliaments for approval.
So it is crucially important to understand why the Treaty deserves to be ratified.
Simply put, it places the interests of Europe's citizens more than ever at the heart of the European Union's activities.
It does so in four ways.
First, the Constitutional Treaty guarantees that the Union's institutions will respect the fundamental rights of everyone within the EU. The "catalogue of fundamental rights" included in the Constitution is extensive, centering on respect for human dignity, freedom, and equality, and also on the principles of democracy and the rule of law.
By enshrining them in the Constitution, these fundamental rights and principles become legally binding, and citizens will have greater scope for bringing appeals to the Court of Justice.
In this respect, the EU leads the world in the protection of fundamental rights.
Second, the Treaty makes the EU more democratic and brings government closer to Europe's citizens.
The Union has no business interfering in matters that can be dealt with successfully at the local, regional, or national level.
The EU's objectives are precisely those that countries are unable to achieve on their own, for example, a stronger economy and greater security.
The Constitutional Treaty includes guarantees to ensure that the EU adheres to this principle strictly.
National parliaments will be able to call a time-out if Brussels makes proposals that seem to interfere unnecessarily.
Should one-third of national parliaments so wish, the European Commission will be required to reconsider a proposal.
In addition, the Constitutional Treaty gives citizens the right to ask the European Commission to take action on a specific point.
A citizens' initiative of this kind will require one million signatures, obtained in different countries.
At the same time, the European Parliament will have far greater powers.
It will have joint decision-making authority in many more areas, including the budget.
As a result, European citizens' elected representatives will be better able to scrutinize the work of the Commission.
Third, the Treaty makes the EU more open and more transparent.
Citizens want powers to be clearly defined and decisions to be taken openly in a way that they can understand.
Many people despair of finding their way through the maze of current EU treaties and their numerous amendments.
Outside Brussels, few people can explain the "pillar" structure and the distinction between the Union and the Community.
The Constitution consigns these complexities to history.
It also gives people far greater access to official information, extending their right of access to documents from all institutions, organs, and bodies.
Finally, the Treaty will make Europe more effective.
This is essential if the issues that affect people's lives are to be tackled successfully.
Two themes that people consider crucial are a stronger European economy (more jobs and more growth) and greater security (reducing cross-border crime).
European countries are heavily reliant on each other in addressing these issues.
People are counting on Europe to take action.
But, because EU decisions often have to be taken unanimously, this can be difficult.
Moreover, the means to work together effectively are often lacking.
The Treaty introduces major improvements here, enabling us to work together more effectively to achieve our aims.
In sum, the Constitutional Treaty firmly enshrines fundamental rights in law, and also makes the EU more democratic, more transparent, and more effective.
This makes it a good deal for everyone - for people who expect more cooperation and more concrete results from the Union, but also for those concerned about excessive interference by Europe in questions that can be better dealt with by the member states themselves.
Next year, we will celebrate 60 years of peace across a large part of Europe.
Never before in our history have we enjoyed such a long period of concord, a period that has seen an enormous growth in prosperity.
Democracy has taken root in almost every corner of Europe, and Europeans now have far greater freedom to live, work, and study where and how they wish.
These achievements are largely due to European cooperation.
The Constitutional Treaty is a reflection of our wish to continue in the same vein, to carry on working together.
We want to reaffirm our commitment to a life without war and injustice, and to the freedom that we hold so dear.
The Constitutional Treaty provides solid foundations for our shared future.
Peace, security, and prosperity are as vulnerable as they are valuable.
This Treaty makes them stronger.
And that makes us stronger.
The signing ceremony is therefore a message of hope.
It is a new beginning.
Croatia after Tudjman
ZAGREB: Franjo Tudjman's death, like his life, was a bizarre parody of Marshal Tito.
Comparisons between Tudjman and Tito, however, are undermined by anachronism.
In Tito's day it was still possible to have strongmen in gleaming white uniforms command European states, albeit in the Balkans.
It was possible to establish authority through collectivist myths, to assert your separate road against global trends, to molest neighbors in the teeth of international censure.
No longer.
Retrograde regional satraps are outdated in a uniting Europe.
And, unlike in Tito's time, whenever the West played Tudjman as a proxy for its interests the results were very mixed.
Tudjman probably did not wish to be independent Croatia's Tito clone, but he could not help himself.
Tito provided the only leadership model that resonated with him.
Under the guise of democratic verbiage and a facade of democratic institutions, Tudjman promoted the monopoly of his nationalist party/movement, the HDZ.
Tudjman's excuse was that Croatia needed to concentrate power for its struggle with Serbian aggression.
The truth is that he used a negotiated hostility with Slobodan Milosevic to solidify personal rule and a Russian-style plunder of state properties by his coterie of loyalists.
In order to accomplish this with a minimum of fuss he muzzled the press and electronic media.
Despite enmity between Serbia and Croatia, dealing dictator to dictator with Milosevic was simple.
Because both Tudjman and Milosevic believed in ethnically homogeneous states, they fomented forced population transfers (ie, ethnic cleansing) and a division of territory between each other.
The chief victim of their land-grab was Bosnia, which they divided and ravaged through various proxies.
The Dayton agreement represented not so much the defeat of their plans as the international legitimation of their division of Bosnia, with Bosnian Muslim enclaves left in a nervous see-saw with Tudjman's vicious Hercegovinian minions.
The consequence of Tudjman's policies -- always projected in a harsh, bullying style -- led to Croatia's isolation from Europe and America.
It is not that Tudjman, on occasion, did not prove useful -- the Croatian army's blitzkreig in 1995 led to Dayton -- but ultimately his arrogance galled more than his cooperation helped.
The tightrope turns that characterized the last several years of his encounter with the West (threats of sanctions for non-cooperation with the Hague war crimes tribunal, holding back Western assistance -- EU aid programs, Partnership for Peace, etc.) reflect this bitter antagonism.
It would be a mistake to imagine that Tudjman's style was entirely unrepresentative.
Croatia's economy and traditional access to Europe could have placed it among the first candidates for European integrations had its political and social elite any notion that this was advantageous.
Instead, lack of opposition to Tudjman points to a broad consensus, in which a wink toward Western values disguises fundamental self-satisfaction with things as they are, or were.
This was not a case of mere nationalism but of a class monopoly fearing competition from outside.
Croatia's opposition was for a long time limited to NGO's such as the Helsinki Committee, which challenged the government on the slippery terrain of human and minority rights, an area where the parliamentary opposition kept its collective mouths shut.
In recent years, however, as the political battle shifted to the deteriorating economy, the public accepted more direct anti-Tudjman critiques, allowing parliamentary opposition to follow.
Because Tudjman created a highly-centralized political system with vast prerogatives vested in the president, the opposition's best bet was to stick together in hope of mustering the two-thirds majority needed to change the constitution.
Unfortunately, this course was abandoned in the summer of 1998 when two opposition parties -- the Social Democrats (ex-Communists, SDP) and the right-of-center Social Liberals (HSLS) -- developed a special relationship that was formalized as a coalition this summer.
In response, other opposition parties, the traditional Croat Peasant Party (HSS), the center-left Liberal Party (LS), the populist Croat National Party (HNS), and the regionalist Istrian Democratic Assembly (IDS), formed their own coalition (the Four).
Formally, the SDP-HSLS and the Four function as a broad opposition alliance (the Six).
In fact, they are bitter rivals and will divide opposition vote at the January 3 elections for the lower house of the Parliament (Sabor).
So it is risky to claim that the opposition will soon rout HDZ.
More likely, there will be ground for various coalition manoeuvres, including between parts of the opposition and HDZ.
Tudjman's death opens the additional question of presidential elections, which must be held within 60 days after his passing.
HDZ has as many candidates as it has factions, and these are numerous.
It is possible that HDZ can win should it nominate Mate Granic, the Western-backed foreign minister.
His moderate reputation is more a matter of style than substance, but it goes a long way outside Croatia.
The question is whether key HDZ leaders prefer losing the presidency (and that is where real power in Croatia lies) to Granic's ascending the throne.
As for the opposition, various presidential ambitions have been manifested, perhaps most especially those of Drazen Budisa (HSLS), a former dissident and political prisoner, and his Social Democratic partner Ivica Racan, the last head of Croatia's Communists.
It is possible that the opposition's awkward coalition will be tested by their rival presidential dreams.
Croatia's course will be tested by the consequences of Tudjman's death and the forthcoming electoral rounds.
The results might be more complicated than anyone wishes.
Unless the constitution and the political system is reformed, kleptocracy checked, and relations with the West mended, Tudjman-era themes may continue.
That is a luxury that Croatia cannot afford.
Without fundamental change now, there is a real possibility of mass popular protests, and not just against Tudjman's direct heirs.
Using and Abusing the Hague Tribunal
The International Tribunal in The Hague was intended as a Sword of Damocles for human rights violators in the Balkans.
Within the Balkans, however, it has become a political tool that both nationalists and their opponents exploit in a never-ending game of divide and (hope to) rule.
Croatia provides a textbook case of this.
Snags and fissures now bedevil Croatia's infant democratic reforms.
The reasons are connected to Premier Ivica Racan's unwillingness to tackle the centers of power left behind by the regime of the late President Franjo Tudjman, whose nationalist-minded party, the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ), was voted out of office in January 2001 following Tudjman's death in December 1999.
Tudjman forged an authoritarian regime that blurred the distinctions between HDZ and state agencies, in particular the army and police.
This muddied legacy remains at the heart of Croatia's current problems and its relations with the Hague Tribunal.
In January 2001 the then new Premier Ivica Racan faced a sharp choice: swiftly purge state bureaucracies of Tudjman's partisans or yield to the obstructive ploys of HDZ loyalists.
True to Racan's instinctive indecisiveness, the Prime Minister dallied.
He preferred to concentrate on constitutional reforms that were largely interpreted as a bid to strip the new president, Stjepan Mesic (himself a longtime opponent of Tudjman) of the robust executive powers Tudjman wrote into the constitution for himself.
Meanwhile, the new government failed to investigate numerous war crimes, miscarriages of justice, and the corruption of the Tudjman era.
This failure emboldened HDZ loyalists to test the Racan government's resolve.
One favorite trick was to create enormous obstacles to even minimal attempts at cracking down on war criminals.
In September 2000, following the assassination of a Hague Tribunal witness and the arrest of a Croatian commander accused of massacring Serbs in 1991, twelve army generals published a letter calling for the defense of Croat veterans and a halt to ``the negative and historically unfounded representation'' of Croatia's record in the Balkan wars.
In a rare show of state determination, President Mesic suspended and forced into retirement all twelve officers.
Several went on to join and lead a new party - Croatian Integrity and Prosperity (HIP), organized by Tudjman's eldest son Miroslav, the former chief of the Croatian intelligence service.
Parrying with Tudjman loyalists continued into the spring of this year, with the arrest of Mirko Norac, one of the twelve generals, who was accused of massacring Serb civilians in 1991.
Various veterans' organizations staged mass rallies against the ``treacherous'' government of Mesic and Racan.
These pressures would not have been as damaging had they not met with approval in parts of Racan's ruling coalition, especially from Drazen Budisa's Croatian Social Liberal Party (HSLS), and also among influential Catholic bishops.
Weakened, the government became psychologically prepared for still greater concessions.
In July, the Hague Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia charged two Croatian generals - Rahim Ademi and Ante Gotovina - with war crimes.
Instead of turning them over to the tribunal, Racan used the opportunity for a power play, requesting a parliamentary vote of confidence for what was intended to be a soft-pedaling of the Hague Tribunal's warrants.
This provoked the resignation of Budisa from the presidency of the Social Liberal Party, inciting a virtual split in this key coalition partner, the only party in the government coalition that wanted to resist the Hague Tribunal.
Despite this, Racan won his vote of confidence and secured a modicum of stability within his cabinet.
Still, the various factions that comprise the Tudjmanite opposition gained a chance to pull Budisa toward them, creating a new center of political gravity for the next crisis.
The Hague Tribunal is often blamed for burdening fragile reform governments in Croatia and Serbia with unreasonable requests that play into the hands of nationalist politicians.
This is true to the extent that the Tribunal is insensitive to the intricate balancing expected of officials in the countries of the former Yugoslavia.
For example, the pre-trial release of Biljana Plavsic, one of the most culpable of Bosnian Serb leaders, in exchange for her evidently ample testimony would make more sense had the Tribunal been equally accommodating on less culpable non-Serb defendants.
A reluctance to prosecute war criminals is an asset that Balkan governments use in order to pacify their nationalist audience and, indeed, to avoid the thorny problems of a thoroughgoing reform.
Racan would not have had to deal with the Hague Tribunal had he the courage to begin his own housekeeping and investigations of Tudjman's cronies and the war criminals the deceased president protected.
Now, Premier Racan is cashing in on his procrastination over Tudjman acolytes, hoping that they will be as generous with him should they return to government.
For in Croatia, every new regime issues a plenary absolution for its predecessors.
A tiny elite is thus insulated from serious challenges and, ultimately, of responsibility for anything, even the most heinous of crimes.
The Three Mis-Represents
It is two years since the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) unveiled its new ideological credo, called the "Three Represents."
What good fortune it is that China's most sacred, encompassing, and powerful doctrine built around the triumvirate of "the interests of the majority of the people" "advanced culture," and "advanced productive forces" found one political party to be its representative!
Good fortune, that is, for the CCP, not for China and its people.
The "Three Represents" has several official versions, each including the words "always," "China," and "represent."
Their meaning is clear.
On the other hand, "majority of the people," "advanced culture," and "advanced productive forces," as well as some other phrases that dominate the doctrine, are vague, perhaps deliberately so.
Common sense suggests that the "majority of the people," whom the CCP is supposed to "represent," should include workers.
But the CCP long ago abandoned the workers.
How many lost their jobs last month?
How many were forced to take early retirement?
How many mining accidents were there?
How many workers' protests?
Who jailed their organizers? The "Representative of the Three Represents" refuse to say.
Workers who protest and strike are "rioting."
Whoever reports such events is "anti-revolutionary."
The same is true of the Party's relationship with the peasants, who provided Mao Zedong with the soldiers and supplies he needed in battles that lasted decades.
Peasants followed Mao because the CCP promised them land.
But Mao decided to take back the land from the peasants even before it was given to them. "The serious problem is the education of the peasants," he said.
So he taught them that all land belongs to the state.
The "representatives" of the peasants are the new landlords.
In a China without democracy, student sentiment is a key political barometer.
Unlike workers or peasants, students include people from all levels of society, so whatever mobilizes them represents society's focus at that time.
From April 15th to June 4th, 1989, students demonstrating in Tiananmen Square, and their supporters, conducted the saddest opinion poll in Chinese history, expressing a common will to end totalitarianism, build democracy, and eliminate corruption.
Those who defend the Party's bloody crackdown of those students have no right to call themselves the representatives of the majority of the people.
Their claim to be "always representing the progressive direction of advanced culture" is yet another grand and empty declaration.
Chinese culture stretches three thousand years into the past and perhaps thousands of years into the future.
Is it to be "always represented" by a lone political party?
I do not know what "the progressive direction of advanced culture" is, but advanced culture played no part in the CCP-inspired "Wipe Out Poisonous Weeds Campaign," the "Anti-Rightist Movement," or the "Eliminate Demons and Evil Heresy Campaign."
Such obscurantism only creates a culture of stultifying uniformity.
Like a blade of grass beneath a stone, culture knows how and in which direction to seek light. It does not need to be "represented."
Of the three "represents," the clearest meaning is to be found in the CCP's vow to "always represent the demands of advanced productive forces."
This means representing the interests of the da-kuan, those who suddenly became rich, usually through government connections.
The phrase has no deeper meaning.
The union of power and money in today's China originates from the steady inflation of bureaucracy.
Before the Great Leap Forward, townships could barely afford a few full-time cadres.
Today, each township has hundreds.
Their basic salary is paid by the central government, but bonuses and extra benefits depend on contributions from the "advanced productive forces" at the county and township level.
Whatever the rich ask of the CCP - land leases, low interest loans, violation of labor laws, environmental standards, contracts, and intellectual property - can be considered "the demands of advanced productive forces."
Even under less corrupt conditions, representing "the most advanced productive forces" is a flawed idea.
Imagine that the Olympic Committee represented only the interests of gold medal winners, or that the Education Ministry represented only post-doctoral programs but ignored elementary schools.
While the high-tech sector at the top of the economic pyramid is important, the traditional sectors at the bottom still form the foundation.
What will become of several hundred million rural peasants and jobless workers in sunset industries?
Who will address inequality and divergent social interests?
An increasingly pluralistic society is being forced into a procrustean structure that allows only one voice, one need, and one kind of interest: the voice, needs, and interests of the party.
But the theory of the Three Represents is nevertheless necessary, because a new situation has emerged.
When the CCP came to power in 1948, it could claim to embody socialism, Marxism, and the proletariat's historical mission.
Fifty years later, socialism's advantages, Marxism's truth, and the proletarian character of the Party have all been unanswerably challenged.
So the Three Represents is an effort to salvage one-party rule.
You may doubt socialism, but you cannot doubt "advanced productive forces."
You may not believe in Marxism, but you must believe in "advanced culture."
The CCP no longer represents workers and peasants, but it can represent the "majority of the people," including "red" capitalists.
Indeed, whether CCP members who have become "revolutionarily" wealthy remain "red" is determined solely by their acceptance of one-party rule.
Welcoming "red capitalists" therefore does not imply democratization.
Such people are more likely to seek to strengthen their privileges than promote pluralism and the rule of law.
Totalitarianism, not political reform, is their livelihood.
It is this, above all else, that the theory of the Three Represents comprehends.
China's Democratic Sham
China is notoriously secretive; its government mechanics inscrutable.
The constitution says that power belongs to the people, but in reality the rights of the people belong to the Communist Party and its leaders, from whom workers and peasants receive scant attention.
The CCP claims to have delivered a democratic revolution, but the country remains one of the world's most undemocratic.
So irreconcilable are these paradoxes that the 16th Party Congress that will convene next week cannot hope but to show itself as a democratic sham.
The highest party posts will change hands at the Congress, including the Chairman of the Central Military Commission, the General Secretary of the Party, and several Politburo Standing Committee members.
According to the CCP Charter, all of those positions (save the leadership of the Military Commission) should be determined by the votes of members of the 16th Central Committee.
The 16th Party Congress should in turn elect the 16th Central Committee, Party Congress representatives should be elected by each provincial party congress, and so on.
In fact, these elections will be characterized by opacity and the absence of any real democratic process.
Indeed, the only elections in China in which truly independent voters choose candidates occur at the village committee level, but this democratic mummery is staged mainly for the benefit of outside observers.
All other Chinese elections share two main characteristics: candidates are selected to preserve party leaders, and the leaders decide the number of candidates.
China holds two types of election: "equal quota elections" and "differential quota elections."
In equal quota elections, the leaders present three candidates, leaving voters the task of picking one.
This is a sacred rule of Chinese politics, one that is considered entirely legitimate.
In the past 50 years, all "elected" officials, including Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping, were designated in ways that delivered the illusion of choice but without the element of uncertainty.
After the Cultural Revolution, and despite widespread protest, "differential quota elections" were introduced, albeit in a limited fashion.
The 13th Party Congress, in tune with the rising democratic sentiments of the time, was the first to use the differential system for electing members of the Central Committee.
This constituted a breakthrough in party tactics.
By presenting voters with more candidates than positions, Deng Liqun, a member of the ultra-left Old Guard, was denied a seat.
Deng Xiaoping, at that time the paramount leader, and Chen Yun, another representative of the powerful Old Guard, were furious at this result.
Of course, no one, even in China, thinks of differential quota elections as being truly democratic.
All the candidates remain handpicked by the leadership, even if the least popular figures can be removed.
In the event, the differential system was a short-lived experiment.
Since 1989 the Party has relentlessly consolidated its central leadership, internal party democracy has been suppressed and voting procedures have actually degenerated.
The Party Congress has its origins in the mass gatherings and propaganda campaigns of the Mao era, and can bring together as many as two thousand delegates.
The First and Second Party Congresses had only a few dozen representatives, who possessed the power to question the party's highest officials.
That sort of accountability is long gone.
During its half-century in power, the CCP has developed a method called da hui xiao kai (big conference held small), which breaks the Congress down into myriad small-group sessions.
The forthcoming 16th Party Congress will be comprised of these small-group sessions.
None will have a clear mandate, and any debate will be emasculated.
Delegates are confused about their roles and powers, and the conditions are perfect for creating a silent majority.
Each session is like an afternoon tea party where representatives offer random reflections, praise the correctness of the leadership's reports and attempt to show how conscientiously they have studied them and how deeply they comprehend them.
The suggestions raised by representatives at tea parties are never made a subject for debate by the Congress as a whole.
Instead they are given to the staff members of the Secretariat to "process."
Some minor revisions to the final report might be made, but the procedures of a real parliamentary democracy-proposal, debate, and resolution-remain absent.
The grave realities that confront China-for example, corruption and the ever-widening social gap-will not be raised as matters for debate.
CCP members will never get the chance to address any concerns that they may hold before a wide audience.
They will not get to discuss the protection of citizen's rights, relaxation of harsh media controls, the rights of peasants to migrate or take up jobs in the cities, or whether to tolerate workers who organize independent unions.
So how important will this 16th Party Congress be?
It certainly will not provide a forum for debating any of the long awaited, urgently needed, and unavoidable political reforms that China must launch.
By rescheduling it for November (apparently Jiang Zemin had double-booked himself by promising to travel to Texas to stay with President Bush on his Crawford ranch), the 16th Party Congress, at which the next generation of China's leaders will be anointed, may play second fiddle to a diplomatic visit.
Remembering Zhao Ziyang
The conditions under which Zhao Ziyang lived at the time of his death, in utter isolation from Chinese society due to an illegally imposed 16-year house arrest, shames both Chinese justice and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).
Zhao's persecution was the persecution of a leader who dedicated himself for over a decade to groundbreaking efforts that became the foundations of China's economic reform.
In the late 1970's, Chinese peasants had long since lost their rights to own their land, owing to collectivization and the establishment of the People's Commune.
It is a right they have never regained.
Zhao, however, was the first to advocate giving autonomy back to the peasants and so initiated the first pilot tests to abolish the People's Commune.
Chinese industry had been transformed into subsidiaries of government through nationalization and central planning.
Zhao was the first to propose "expanded autonomy for Chinese enterprises" and "restoration of a healthy relationship between government and industry."
Expanded autonomy for enterprises and the peasantry were critical first steps whose success led eventually to full-blown economic reform.
These were among the many incremental victories Zhao won to help China's people break out of the suffocating stagnation of Maoist socialism.
As China's Premier, Zhao implemented ten years of economic reforms that brought steady progress in which the people, especially the peasantry, enjoyed tangible improvements.
But Zhao was also the only CCP leader to propose a political reform package to tackle China's system of one-party rule.
The Party's unchallenged monopoly on political power systematically ensured that every mistake it made -- such as the dreadful decade of the Cultural Revolution -- turned into a prolonged nationwide crisis.
For genuine and long-term stability, Zhao proposed reforms that ultimately aimed at the legalization and systemization of democracy.
He wished to establish the kind of democratic politics that could support and nurture a healthy market economy.
Although the short-term practical objectives of Zhao's political reforms were limited by the circumstances in which they were proposed, the measures all aimed at containing Communist Party power and represented a concrete step toward returning, peacefully, power to China's people.
Zhao's package -- a sharp break with Mao's totalitarianism -- was approved by the 13th Party Congress, officially the highest authority within the CCP.
During his twenty months as CCP General Secretary, Zhao created a culture in which the Politburo refrained from interfering in the courts, and he stopped its attempts to control literature and the arts.
Zhao abolished the policy of enterprises being run by Party organizations and the system by which fa ren ("legal representatives") were the core of enterprises.
Unfortunately, Zhao's political reforms were terminated upon his fall from power.
The dreadful result was the indiscriminate denial of civil rights and the principles of democracy, and the rise of what today's leaders call "socialism with Chinese characteristics" -- a bitter euphemism for unchecked Party and government power entwined with commercial interests.
Zhao's fate is also a chilling reminder of other injustices that are on the consciences of those now in power.
The only reason for Zhao's continued ill treatment was his opposition to the violent repression of the Tiananmen Square protest in 1989.
It should have been his decision to make as General Secretary, but things were not as they should have been.
It should be remembered that former General Secretary Hu Yaobang, who had been forced to step down two years earlier by Deng Xiaoping because of his liberal stance, died in April 1989, triggering spontaneous and peaceful student demonstrations in Beijing, which spread across the country.
Half a million college students in Beijing alone were involved in this movement.
It lasted 50 days and was heartily supported by Beijing residents and people all around the country, from all walks of life.
Zhao pointed out to the Politburo that the sentiments expressed by the students and residents in their commemoration of Hu, in their protests against corruption, and their desire for democracy were really the same sentiments that they themselves held.
He believed that it should be possible to resolve the student protests and respect the principles of democracy and the rule of law.
Under Zhao's direction, the Politburo and its Standing Committee called for dialogue with the students.
This hopeful direction changed completely, however, when Deng Xiaoping revealed his desire for a violent crackdown.
In the end, it came down to a fight among five members of the Politburo Standing Committee: Li Peng and Yao Yiling sought to deploy the military.
Zhao opposed this.
Qiao Shi and Hu Qili initially sided with Zhao, but then withdrew their support and, instead, asked Deng Xiaoping to make the final decision.
With deep divisions evident, Deng chose to bypass all existing institutions, the Party's Politburo, the Central Committee, and the National People's Congress and its Standing Committee.
Without further discussion, Deng mobilized 500,000 troops to enter Beijing to crack down on the unarmed students and civilians.
The Tiananmen Square Massacre of 1989 was a tragedy for China, and another tragedy for the twentieth century.
Sixteen years have passed, but the pain remains, buried in the hearts and minds of the people.
In the years that have passed, China's leaders were responsible not only for Zhao's unlawful house arrest but also for a systematic effort to erase his name from history.
But their attempts to conceal the truth about the past only reveal their weakness and their shamelessness.
For one thing they cannot change: Zhao Ziyang remains with us, in the Chinese people's ongoing struggle for rights and democracy.
A New Start for Non-Proliferation
Obama has pledged to revitalize the 1970 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), which aims to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons.
The non-proliferation regime, of which the NPT is the cornerstone, is in disarray.
The main problems are easily identified.
First, the five main nuclear-weapon states have not taken seriously their NPT obligation to work for nuclear disarmament.
Instead, they have insisted that nuclear weapons are essential for their security and continued to modernize their nuclear arsenals.
This naturally robs them of the moral authority to persuade others not to acquire nuclear weapons, which continue to be perceived as a source of power and influence, and an insurance policy against attack.
Second, as we have seen in the case of North Korea, there is nothing to stop countries that sign the Treaty from simply walking out after declaring that "extraordinary events" have jeopardized their supreme interests.
Third, the International Atomic Energy Agency, which is supposed to police the non-proliferation system, is shamefully underfunded.
When it comes to determining whether or not a country is conducting a covert nuclear weapons program, IAEA inspectors often have their hands tied, either because they lack the legal authority to gain access to all the locations they consider necessary, or because the IAEA's analytical laboratories are outdated, or because the Agency does not have adequate access to satellite imagery.
Fourth, export controls have failed to prevent the spread of sensitive nuclear technology, not least due to the sophisticated efforts of clandestine networks like the one run by Pakistani nuclear scientist A.Q. Khan.
Nine countries already have nuclear weapons, and it would be naive to presume that others, particularly in regions of conflict, will not try to get hold of them.
In addition, a number of countries with nuclear energy programs have the capability, if they choose, to manufacture nuclear weapons within a matter of months if their security perceptions change, because they have mastered the critical technology -- uranium enrichment and plutonium reprocessing.
If more countries take this path, it could prove to be the Achilles' heel of non-proliferation.
Fifth, the international community, spearheaded by the United Nations Security Council, has more often than not been paralyzed in the face of challenges to international security and ineffectual in responding to suspected cases of nuclear proliferation.
These issues will not be resolved overnight.
But there is much that can be done relatively quickly.
The United States and Russia have started negotiations on deep cuts in their nuclear arsenals, which together account for 95% of the world's 27,000 warheads.
Other key steps include bringing into force the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty; negotiating a verifiable treaty to end production of fissile material for use in weapons; radically improving the physical security of nuclear and radioactive materials, which is vital to prevent them from falling into the hands of terrorists; and strengthening the IAEA.
Last month, I proposed a key measure to strengthen non-proliferation to the IAEA's Board of Governors -- establishing an IAEA bank of low-enriched uranium (LEU) to guarantee supplies to countries that need nuclear fuel for their power reactors.
LEU cannot be used to make weapons.
Some such mechanism will be essential in the coming decades as more and more countries introduce nuclear energy.
My proposal is to create a physical stockpile of LEU at the disposal of the IAEA as a last-resort reserve for countries with nuclear power programs that face a supply disruption for non-commercial reasons.
This would give countries confidence that they can count on reliable supplies of fuel to run their nuclear power plants, and therefore do not need to develop their own uranium-enrichment or plutonium-reprocessing capability.
This could help to avoid a repeat of Iran's experiences after its 1979 revolution, when contracts for fuel and technology for its planned nuclear power program were not honored.
Thirty years later, some of the consequences are still being felt.
The LEU would be available to countries in need on the basis of non-political and non-discriminatory criteria.
It would be accessible at market prices to all states in compliance with their nuclear safeguards obligations.
No state would be required to give up the right to develop its own fuel cycle.
The money needed to launch an LEU bank is in place, thanks primarily to a non-governmental organization -- the Nuclear Threat Initiative -- and initial funding from Warren Buffett.
But this can only be a first step.
It should be followed by an agreement that all new enrichment and reprocessing activities will be placed exclusively under multinational control, and that all existing such facilities will be converted from national to multinational control.
This is a bold idea, but bold ideas are needed now more than ever.
The opportunity to put the nuclear fuel cycle under multinational control was missed 60 years ago because of the Cold War.
The spread of nuclear technology and the growing risk of nuclear terrorism make it imperative that we get it right this time.
The Nobel Prize and Einstein's Ghost
This December 10
Alfred Nobel died on 10 December 1896.
When his will was opened it was found that he had donated his considerable wealth to creating the prizes that bear his name.
Five prizes were mentioned: physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, literature and peace; and four prize-awarding institutions named: the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences (for physics and chemistry), the Karolinska Institutet (for physiology or medicine), the Swedish Academy (for literature) and a group appointed by the Norwegian Parliament, later called ``The Norwegian Nobel Committee'' (for peace).
Sweden and Norway were then tied together in a union.
Since the creation of the Nobel prizes, more than 650 medals and diplomas have been given away in the original prize areas.
A prize in economic sciences in memory of Alfred Nobel was established by the Bank of Sweden in 1968.
Most of these prizes are connected with scientific breakthroughs, literary masterpieces and attempts to make peace in a violent century.
The thread running though all the stories of the prize winners is the concept of creativity: both individual creativity and creative environments.
One story - that of a Nobel Laureate in Physics, Albert Einstein - is particularly explicative of the process.
Perhaps the most common question about the Nobel Prize in Physics is this: ``Why didn't Einstein get the prize for his theory of relativity?''
At the age of 26, during his ``annus mirabulis'' of 1905, Einstein published three papers that were to influence the entire 20



Of the three theories, the theory of relativity became the most written about and discussed.
When the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences year after year asked scientists for their nominations, many answered that Einstein deserved the Nobel Prize in Physics for his special theory of relativity.
But the Nobel Committee for Physics didn't agree, and for years no prize was awarded to Einstein!
At first the Nobel Committee argued that the theory might be wrong and wrote that it would be best to wait for experimental evidence that confirmed Einstein's theory.
When Einstein managed to generalise his theory and introduced the curved space-time, in which light bends around heavy astronomical bodies, the number of nominations increased even more.
But the Nobel Committee for Physics had a powerful member, Allvar Gullstrand, professor at Uppsala University and Nobel Laureate in Physiology or Medicine 1911 for his work on how the light bends in the eye.
In his opinion, Einstein was wrong, and he tried to prove it by making his own calculations.
Today, we know that Gullstrand was wrong, but his opposition was enough to block the prize-awarding process.
In Uppsala, however, another professor, Carl Wilhelm Oseen, a specialist on mathematical physics, understood Einstein's theories and had also understood the power balance in the Nobel Committee for Physics.
As a newly elected member of the Academy, in 1921 he was the first to propose giving to Einstein a Nobel Prize for his work on the photoelectric effect.
This single nomination made the wheels begin to turn in Einstein's favor.
Oseen was made a member of the Nobel Committee and wrote a positive report on the theory of the photoelectric effect.
The very next year, Albert Einstein was awarded the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics ``for his services to Theoretical Physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect.''
So was the Royal Academy of Sciences mistaken in not giving its award of a Nobel Prize to Einstein for what most people would consider his most important intellectual discovery?
Many have argued that this is the case.
But one has to study a little bit more history of physics before making the final judgment.
In this history it is clear that Einstein's paper from 1905 not only explained the photoelectric effect, but also initiated something of a greater magnitude, something revolutionary: it introduced the concept of the photon, the wave-particle which not only lies at the heart of our understanding of both micro- and macrocosmos, but which led to technical applications such as medical laser scalpels and the laser diodes of the Internet.
With regard to the text of Alfred Nobel's will, which requires that a Nobel Laureate confer the greatest benefit on mankind, Einstein's introduction of the photon by far surpasses the theory of relativity!
Today the work of the five Nobel Committees goes on, mainly along the same lines as at the beginning of the 20

Europe's Corner of Despair
-- Three floors of Moldova's parliament building are a charred ruin.
So is democracy in Moldova, a former Soviet republic that is now Europe's poorest country.
Of Moldova's 3.5 million people at the time of independence, 15% have already left the country to seek better lives elsewhere.
More than 63% of Moldova's young people say they want out.
In early April, a disputed election victory by Moldova's ruling Communists triggered protests.
Political opponents and disaffected people, many of them young and with few prospects of finding jobs, took to the streets.
A violent few broke into the offices of the country's president and its parliament building, which was set on fire.
In response, the Communists blamed the violence on the opposition political parties, which it called "fascists," and on Romania and Romanian irredentists in Moldova.
The police cracked down on young people and took hundreds into custody.
Several died, apparently from beatings.
President Vladimir Voronin later granted the detainees amnesty.
Nevertheless, many remain in detention and Voronin continues to hurl accusations at the opposition and Romania of organizing a coup d'état.
Legal proceedings have been opened against opposition parties.
Restoring stability and a fair democratic system to Moldova is important, first and foremost, because Moldovans deserve a government that is accountable.
Stability is also important because the country borders on Romania, a European Union member state.
The two countries share a language and culture, and, until Stalin separated them, were even part of the same state.
A vocal minority of Moldova's people believe that merging their country with Romania would put the country into the express lane to EU membership, with its generous financial perks and, perhaps most enticing of all, passports that would enable them to escape a no-hope economy to build lives elsewhere.
Many Moldovans, indeed, already have Romanian passports so that they can travel and work in the EU.
Some Romanian officials, including President Traian Basescu, have bandied about the idea of distributing Romanian passports to as many as a million Moldovan citizens, a quarter of the entire population.
Of course, the Moldovan government balks at any attempt to lure away its citizens.
The United States should do more to help bring stability to Moldova.
Together with the EU, the US can help ensure a credible investigation of the post-election violence and complaints against the police.
Amerca should be more energetic in demanding that the Moldovan authorities respect the rule of law, issue a roster of all detained persons, provide them access to lawyers and family members, and guarantee that they are not harassed.
Opposition leaders and democracy watchdogs say Moldova's election process was fundamentally flawed.
The country's broadcast media, especially its television stations, gave a disproportionate amount of air time to the ruling Communists during the election campaign.
The Communists are alleged to have rigged the balloting by adding names to the voter rolls and reviving the dead for the day.
In the long run, the US and EU should support civil society organizations in pressing Moldova's government to guarantee more equitable distribution of television time, to stop police harassment of opposition political leaders and workers as well as journalists, to reform the police and end the ruling party's abuse of state institutions, and to allow all political parties more opportunity to inspect election rolls and monitor polling stations.
They should insist that opposition parties are included in a dialogue.
The US can put weight behind its demands by placing conditions on its financial assistance to Moldova.
The EU has even more leverage.
Moldova is more dependent on the EU than any other former Soviet republic.
More than half of the country's trade is with the Union, and Moldova receives significant EU financial assistance.
Most Moldovan emigrants work in the EU, and almost 75% of Moldova's population support EU membership.
Romania, too, should play its part and offer to sign a basic treaty and a border agreement with Moldova.
The last thing impoverished Moldovans need is an autocratic, unaccountable government that lacks sufficient imagination to find a way to revive the country.
And just about the last thing the EU needs is an influx of hundreds of thousands of migrants fleeing poverty, political repression, and despair in Moldova and other countries of the former Soviet Union.
Poor Little Rich Country
Feeling sympathy for Norway is hard.
Thanks to its massive North Sea oil reserves, the country has achieved a level of wealth unimaginable only a generation ago - and which has allowed it to cold-shoulder the European Union since 1994.
But Norway's problems, while hardly on a par with Sub-Saharan Africa or Afghanistan, are nonetheless serious enough to elicit concern, if not pity.
When a country's newly discovered natural resource abundance leads to windfall wealth, investment in the rest of its economy shifts away from the tradeables sector (mainly manufactured exports) and into the nontradeables sector (mainly consumer goods and services).
The diagnosis is a familiar one known as "the Dutch disease."
If and when the natural resource generating the windfall wealth (in this case, oil and gas) disappears, the economy is left with too few competitive industries and too many empty bookstore-cafes. Painful restructuring is sure to follow.
So far, Norway has avoided the worst pitfalls of the Dutch disease by using its massive oil revenues to establish a national savings scheme, the Petroleum Fund, which is permitted to invest only in foreign assets.
This rule serves to curb inflationary demand pressure while preventing elected officials from squandering the country's riches on politically rewarding but economically wasteful projects.
On both counts, however, Norway has recently lowered its guard and is heading for trouble.
Wages throughout the economy have soared, with the average increase likely to hit a whopping 6% this year.
To compensate, firms have been raising prices, fueling inflation.
But with the central bank committed to holding annual inflation to an average of 2.5%, Norway's interest rates are currently among the highest in Europe.
This has helped cause the exchange rate to strengthen by nearly 10% over the last year against the currencies of Norway's main trading partners, making the tradeables sector even less competitive.
Domestic industries that face foreign competition are beginning to close down or relocate abroad.
As a result, in one of the world's richest countries, unemployment is rising.
But the real problem is the public sector.
Government spending is now increasing by 4% annually because of a new "action rule," enacted in 2001, that allows revenue from the Petroleum Fund to be phased into the domestic economy.
But the additional budget revenue has merely offset lower taxes, while high wages and interest rates are jacking up public expenses.
So more government spending is needed to maintain public services at the same level - and to keep unemployment down.
The cycle thus takes another vicious turn: higher interest rates, continuing currency appreciation, further decimation of the tradeables sector, and the risk of more unemployment.
If Norway is to avoid succumbing to the Dutch disease, there can be only one solution.
With the importance of the tradeables sector dwindling away, the nontradeables sector must increase its productivity and output.
There is only one main way that the necessary productivity and outcome gains can be achieved: excess demand in the public sector must be shifted elsewhere.
After all, the demand will not disappear on its own.
Waiting lists for medical and nursing services in Norway already seem endless, and school buildings are deteriorating - some have even been closed down by the public health authorities.
A range of public services will therefore have to be privatized.
As always, this will be a politically contentious and challenging process.
But it will also provide a golden opportunity to realize the country's potential through a strategy of sensible investment - the original purpose of the Petroleum Fund.
This strategy should include significant investments in human capital: education, training, and basic scientific research.
But brilliant ideas cannot be made to order.
Any government effort to sustain dying industries or to allocate investment by picking all sorts of "innovative" projects will be a recipe for economic disaster.
As so often in the rest of the world, windfall wealth such as came to Norway because of its oil and gas, can be a curse as much as it is a blessing.
With just 10-15 years of estimated oil reserves remaining, the United Arab Emirates last year dropped visa requirements for most Westerners in an effort to accelerate the development of a viable tourist trade.
With the recent discovery of its huge Caspian Sea reserves, Kazakhstan stands at the start of this process.
These countries, like Norway, were winners in the natural resource lottery.
But that is no guarantee that they will remain rich after the payments stop.
The reliability and size of the European Union's farm output means that it can and should play the role of regulator in global markets.
If Europe cut back on its agricultural production, the increase in its own food imports would contribute significantly to a worldwide increase in food prices.
This makes it imperative that EU food production levels be held steady -- for the sake of Europeans and of people in the world's poorest countries.
But Europe cannot build up its own agriculture to the detriment of the less fortunate.
So the EU must harmonize its policies with poorer countries.
At present, export subsidies and support payments represent less than 1% of the European agricultural budget, and the EU has undertaken to eliminate them once it receives reciprocal undertakings from major food-exporting countries.
Since 2001, with the "Everything but Arms" initiative, all products from poor countries -- with the exception of weapons and munitions -- can enter the EU single market on a duty-free basis.
This has led to the EU becoming the primary market for the poorest countries' products.
The EU is also developing ways to respond to new global challenges through changes to its Common Agricultural Policy.
This was reflected in the decision to suspend the "set aside" rule that requires a proportion of agricultural land to lie fallow.
Now the EU is preparing to increase dairy quotas progressively, and evaluating the impact on world markets of its decisions regarding bio-fuels.
But Europe's focus must be on encouraging the development of local agriculture.
Doing so is the only way to achieve greater global food security and reduce poverty.
It will also make it possible to ensure that today's high prices for agricultural products are transformed into opportunity for poor farmers.
This is vital because, according to the World Bank, growth in farming eliminates poverty twice as much as growth in any other economic sector.
Indeed, agriculture remains the primary productive sector in the world's poorest countries, employing 65% of the working population and, on average, contributing more than 25% to GDP.
But over the past 20 years, support for agricultural development has been declining.
Only 4% of public development assistance is now earmarked for agriculture.
The European Commission and EU member states are therefore planning to increase their assistance, both through the European Development Fund and by developing new sources of financial support.
Further liberalization of farm trade will not ensure food security.
Faced with the erratic nature of agricultural markets, regulation is needed to soften the impact on poorer countries of volatile food prices.
This does not mean that protectionism is the way forward, only that taking account of specific issues that affect international farm trade -- weather, price volatility, or health risks -- may be necessary from time to time.
But, in a world where productivity differentials can be as great as one to 1,000, it would be unwise to rely on markets alone to enable the poorest countries to expand their economies.
Nor is it likely that much economic expansion will result from competition between multinational food distributors and producers in countries where famine still stalks the land.
Instead, bringing together outside expertise and local knowledge of the geography and environmental and economic constraints in order to spread risks and share the management of resources and projects is far more likely to help poor countries achieve food independence.
It was such an approach that, in less than 20 years, helped postwar Europe achieve food sovereignty.
Countries that have protected their agricultural development from the threats posed by international markets -- such as India or Vietnam -- have achieved substantial reductions in agricultural poverty.
The time has also come to prioritize agriculture in order to ensure growth with a more human face.
At the heart of the EU, France wants to play its part in a collective effort that is fast becoming a major issue for us all.
Trade and the Third World
Hypocrisy and trade-talk go together, as America's decision to impose tariffs on imported steel shows.
Although that action is expected to be judged illegal by the World Trade Organization (WTO), developing countries remain wary.
Historically, they (India prominent among them) argued that the WTO is a tool of rich countries and so resisted much of what it sought to do.
Indeed, before the WTO ministerial meeting in Doha earlier this year, India's line was to oppose the launch of a new trade round, resist further trade liberalization in industrial goods, and oppose the use of trade sanctions to punish countries that fail to meet minimal labor standards.
The perception that the WTO is largely an instrument of the powerful, industrialized nations is broadly correct.
To oppose it on all fronts, however, is wrong.
A more sophisticated approach towards the WTO (and the North in general) is needed.
The WTO says that it is a democratic organization run on the principle of one country, one vote.
Anybody who follows the WTO knows that rich countries get around this `nuisance' democratic formality by lobbying behind the scenes to fix the agenda in advance.
Despite this, constant opposition to the WTO is self-defeating.
As the dispute about America's new steel tariffs illustrates, in today's globalized world a centralized trade ombudsman is vital.
Eliminating the WTO would be like trying to run a modern society without a law court.
While law courts are typically more lenient towards the rich and powerful, it is still better to have them than not.
Chronic opposition also reveals a lack of self-confidence of the sort when you cannot decide what is good for yourself but, instead, demand the opposite of what your trading partners want in the belief that what is good for them must be bad for you.
This implies a zero-sum view of global economics that is false.
In economic transactions there are many instances where everyone gains or everyone loses.
So consider in this light India's three demands.
It is right for India to have opposed injecting international labor standards into the WTO agenda, but it is wrong that India strongly opposed a new trade round.
India's average tariff rate is around 30%.
While much lower than previously, it is higher than in most industrialized nations.
But India independently decided to lower tariffs over the next three years.
A global program to lower tariffs means that India would only be asked to do what it planned to do anyway.
As others would have to lower their tariffs, India's access to other markets would increase.
Nowadays, economic policy is so complex that it is not always clear what is good for a nation and what is not.
Last December, there was furor in India when a dispute settlement panel of the WTO ruled against India's practice of (1) forcing automobile manufacturers in India to buy a certain proportion of parts from Indian producers, and (2) requiring automotive manufacturers who need to import parts and kits to export goods worth the same value.
If we reflect on these conditions, it is not at all clear that these policies are good for India.
Forcibly creating a market for Indian automobile parts eases pressure on these manufacturers to improve quality.
Forcing Indian cars to use such parts handicaps Indian cars from matching international quality.
The Retreat of Global Democracy
A nasty, unintended side-effect of globalization is its corrosive effect on democracy.
Even if individual countries are becoming more democratic, it seems, the sum of global democracy is shrinking thanks in no small part to globalization.
Democracy means many things, but at its core it requires that people choose their rulers and that votes be weighted equally.
But globalization means that nations and peoples can exert an asymmetric influence.
America can cut off trade with Cuba not only by curtailing its own trade but by threatening punitive action against others who trade or invest in Cuba.
Cuba, however, can do little to hurt America's economy.
Likewise, China can injure Taiwan in ways that Taiwan cannot reciprocate.
Of course, the powerful have always encroached on the sovereignty of others.
Take the story, perhaps apocryphal, of an Indian diplomat showing a map of South Asia to Stalin.
"India is a very big country," Stalin observed, and then pointing to Sri Lanka said, "What is the name of this little Indian island?" "That is not an Indian island, sir," the diplomat replied, "it is a sovereign nation."
"Why?
"Stalin asked.
Thanks to globalization, however, dominant nations have a variety of new tools with which to influence other countries short of war.
Foremost is money.
Instantaneous electronic links and an improving system of global guarantees allow capital to flow across national boundaries as never before.
Rapid withdrawal of such capital can have devastating effects, as we saw in 1997 when Asia's super-performing economies succumbed to financial crisis.
In 1998, during the Asian crisis, the rescue package offered by several industrialized nations - prominently Japan and the US - required Korea to lift bans on imports of certain Japanese products and to open up its banking sector to foreign banks (which is what America wanted).
People in vulnerable nations have very little say in the imposition of these policies.
Trade sanctions for political/security ends also serve the same function.
Another consequence of the freer flow of capital is a greater intertwining of different markets.
A fall in the Thai housing market can cause the Thai baht to collapse in ways that could not have happened before; a fall in the Indian rupee can cause a meltdown of the Indian stock market in ways inconceivable ten years ago.
The large presence of overseas investors is the cause here.
Suppose a New Yorker buys shares in the Mumbai stock market.
For that, dollars are converted into rupees, which are used to buy shares.
The aim is not to hold rupees but to make money and eventually re-convert to dollars.
Suppose, then, that the rupee's exchange rate begins to fall.
The foreign investor will naturally want to sell off Indian stocks.
While a fall in the exchange rate with no decline in stock prices gives Indian investors no reason to flee the stock market, if sufficient numbers of foreign investors begin to sell, stock prices will decline so that Indian investors, too, sell their stocks.
What can be done about the erosion of global democracy and accountability?
Utopian schemes such as a global government or a global bank answerable to all nations are a distant dream.
What is needed is a system in which the poor have a voice alongside the rich in the organizations (the IMF, WTO, World Bank, and UN) that mediate in world economics and international relations.
Today, equity is violated in most international organizations through at least two routes.
First, there is the open channel, which gives a larger share of votes to the nations contributing more to organizations such as the IMF and the World Bank.
The second route is the lack of transparency in decision-making.
In domestic democratic politics, if the decision-making process is visible to all, it becomes difficult for any group to hijack the agenda.
Big business and the military are able to push through their interests much more in Pakistan than in India because India's government is more open to scrutiny.
The same goes for international organizations.
Powerful nations, by virtue of contributing senior personnel and money, gain greater access.
Decisions taken behind opaque walls are more likely to be diverted to their interests.
Take the WTO.
While it does subscribe to the principle of one-country one-vote, it is widely perceived as a preserve of rich nations.
This is because of what can be called the "green room" effect, that is, what goes on behind the scenes.
If the WTO is to be a democratic institution, it must not allow its green room to be hijacked by a few.
This problem is most obvious when drafting international labor standards.
Although supposedly designed in the interests of the workers in developing countries, the biggest opposition to them comes from poor countries, and rightly so.
The form that these standards take - and the increasing talk of using trade sanctions to impose them - is close to what protectionist lobbies in industrial nations seek.
This is not surprising given the greater access of rich countries.
The fact that questioning the practices of rich nations (who contribute more funds) exercising more voting power in these organizations sounds outrageous, shows how far away we remain from global democracy.
After all, it does not seem outrageous that Bill Gates does not have multiple votes in the US elections on the ground that he contributes more to government coffers.
Indeed, the suggestion that Gates should have more votes sounds outrageous.
This is because democracy within a nation is a settled idea.
Now it is time to provide more equal voting power to nations irrespective of their wealth, because one of the basic tenets of democracy is that the advantages of wealth should not be compounded by giving the rich extra voting power.
When the idea of "one-person one-vote" arose, feudal landlords predicted chaos in the decision-making process.
How wrong they were.
For the sake of global stability, economic efficiency and also the fight against terrorism we must instill greater democracy within our international organizations.
This may not be in the immediate individual interest of every state, especially big and powerful ones, but is, in the long run, in the enlightened interest of all of humanity collectively.
China's Worrisome Nationalism
Nationalist sentiment has been on the rise in China for a decade.
This may be hidden from President Bush when he visits China next month, but it is there all the same.
From 1993 to 2001 a series of abrasive encounters poisoned the atmosphere: the forced boarding of a Chinese merchant ship (wrongly suspected of carrying chemical warfare components to Iran) in the Arabian Gulf; US efforts to block China's bid to host the 2000 Olympics; escalating tensions over Taiwan; the Wen Ho Lee affair (where China was falsely implicated in the theft of American nuclear secrets); the accidental bombing of China's embassy by US warplanes during the Kosovo war; and the mid-air collision of a US spy plane and a Chinese jet fighter last year.

Cumulatively, these events evoked bitter memories of 19 guochi - ``national humiliation'' - was invoked to express China's righteous indignation at the bullying imperialists.
Nor was this a propaganda ploy, as some suggested.
Though initiated by the government, the guochi revival resonated in Chinese society.
A 1999 public opinion survey of more than 1200 university students in Beijing revealed that fully 75% of well-educated respondents agreed with the statement that, ``The [Belgrade] embassy bombing was a deliberate act of the US Government.''
By the end of the 1990s a majority of Chinese citizens regarded America as their primary adversary.
In this environment, more than a few Chinese reacted to the events of September 11 guochi , three young Chinese males engaged in the following exchange of messages on the internet: Righteous Eagle : The US uttered a few shameful words of apology and our government released 24 pigs....
On the surface it appears that the United States apologized to China, but what commitments did the US assume, really?
They didn't agree to anything....
Who can swallow this?
We need to settle a blood debt but we just let the devils go home?
Gracious : ....My web comrades, how can we face the martyrs who have fought these past several hundred years for national self-respect and the strengthening of the country?
How can we face our ancestors?
I feel so ashamed before you....
Lin Zi ... What difference is there between the China of today and the China of one hundred years ago? ...
As our tears flow down our cheeks, I do not dare believe that this is our country, the China that gave birth to me and raised me....
I would sooner die than go on living like this.
My life belongs to my country.
Do not make the people distrust you, my motherland!
Let's wake you up.
Mother!
Your sufferings are far from over....
These rants display a second major feature of the Chinese cult of guochi : the tendency to blame a weak, feckless Chinese government for not standing up to predatory foreigners.
On many such occasions in the past, from the Boxer Rebellion to the May 4
Indeed, fearful of popular backlash against its decision to release the crew of the US spyplane without securing either a meaningful American apology or adequate financial compensation, China's government quietly shut down several popular internet sites in the weeks following the spy plane incident - including the chatroom that posted the above-cited messages.
Since September 11 guochi revival has abated somewhat.
In the interest of promoting Sino-American cooperation against terrorism the Chinese government has toned down the emotional content of its anti-American rhetoric.
Last month, for example, the revelation that an American-made Boeing 737, specially outfitted for the use of President Jiang Zemin, was bugged with dozens of listening devices, elicited only a mild from the Chinese government.
No stoning of US embassies; no mass internet hysteria.
Some Chinese scholars now question the wisdom of allowing the bitter anti-foreignism of the 19
Evidently, China's top leader agrees.
Speaking last July on the occasion of the 80 guochi to rest and ``face the world like a big country.''
Good Capitalism, Bad Capitalism
We find it useful to divide the capitalist economies into four broad categories.
While many economies straddle several of these, most economies fall primarily into one of them.
The following typology helps explain why some economies grow more rapidly than others.
Oligarchic capitalism exists where power and money are highly concentrated among a few.
It is the worst form of capitalism, not only because of the extreme inequality in income and wealth that such economies tolerate, but also because the elites do not promote growth as the central goal of economic policy.
Instead, oligarchs fix the rules to maximize their own income and wealth.
Such arrangements prevail in large parts of Latin America, the Arab Middle East, and Africa.
State-guided capitalism describes economies where growth is a central economic objective (as it is in the other two forms of capitalism), but attempts to achieve it by favoring specific firms or industries.
Governments allocate credit (through direct bank ownership or by guiding credit decisions by privately owned banks), provide direct subsidies and/or tax incentives, grant trade protection, or use other regulatory devices in an attempt to "pick winners."
Southeast Asian economies have demonstrated great success with state guidance, and, until the late 1990's, there were calls in the United States to emulate their practices.
But the Achilles heel of state guidance is that once such economies near the "production-possibility frontier," policy makers run out of industries and technologies to copy.
When government officials rather than markets then try to choose the next winners, they run a great risk of choosing the wrong industries, or channeling too much investment -- and thus excess capacity -- into existing sectors.
Such a tendency contributed significantly to the Asian financial crisis of 1997-98. Big Firm or managerial
Smaller enterprises exist, but are typically retail or service establishments with one or only a few employees.
Firms get to be large by exploiting economies of scale, refining and mass-producing the radical innovations developed by entrepreneurs (discussed next).
Western European economies and Japan are leading exemplars of managerial capitalism, which, like state guidance, also has delivered strong economic performance.
But managerial capitalism, too, has its Achilles heel.
Bureaucratic enterprises are typically allergic to taking big risks -- that is, developing and commercializing the radical innovations that push out the production-possibility frontier and generate large sustained jumps in productivity and thus in economic growth.
Large firms are relatively risk-averse not only because they are bureaucracies, with layers of management required to sign off on any innovation, but also because they are reluctant to back innovations that threaten to render obsolete the products or services that currently account for their profits.
In our view, the limits of managerial capitalism explain why, after approaching US levels of per capita income in the late 1980's, both Western Europe and Japan failed to match America's information-technology-driven productivity resurgence that began in the 1990s.
This leads to the fourth type: entrepreneurial capitalism .
Economies in which dynamism comes from new firms historically have commercialized the radical innovations that keep pushing out the production-possibility frontier.
Examples from the last two centuries include such transformative products and innovations as railroads, automobiles, and airplanes; telegraph, telephones, radio, and television; air conditioning; and, as just noted, the various technologies responsible for the IT revolution, including both mainframe and personal computers, routers and other hardware devices, and much of the software that operates them.
To be sure, no economy can realize its full potential only by having entrepreneurial firms.
The optimal mix of firms contains a healthy dose of large enterprises, which have the financial and human resources to refine and mass-produce radical innovations, along with newer firms.
The reason why unborn people do not have any rights is that unborn people do not have anything.
They do not have legs, or hair, or a taste for Mozart.
They are not here; they do not exist; period.
Unborn people should not be thought of as some special class waiting in the wings for the cue to bring them onstage.
Of course, when born these future generations will have rights.
The debate over what form these rights should take has been going on for over two millennia, so it is difficult to summarise.
Nevertheless, it can be said that the debate has been almost entirely about the rights that people have to what is available at the time, and this applies equally to future generations.
If, at any point in time, people have any moral rights at all, they are rights to what is available.
To begin with they will have basic natural rights to life and as much freedom and security to pursue whatever it is that makes their lives valuable to them as is compatible with the maximum freedom and security of others.
These "rights" may also entail secondary moral rights to a certain share of the "goods" available to society at any point.
But they have no "right" to what was, or will become, available at any other time.
For example, we may regret that we can no longer see some species of wild animal that has been hunted to extinction by people who lived centuries ago.
But we would not claim that, in doing so, they violated our "rights".
If we have a moral "right" it must be possible for us, in principle, to insist on its being respected, or to complain to whoever has the counterpart obligation if it is not being respected, or to delegate somebody else -- such as our lawyer -- to claim that our rights be respected.
In practice, in many parts of the world today, these courses of action are not open to most people.
But this is because of a deficiency in their social arrangements and their political or judicial systems.
It is not a matter of logical impossibility.
Between distant generations, however, such is logically impossible.
Even in lawsuit-happy America one could not find a lawyer to represent my claim against the hunters who, three centuries ago, deprived me of the chance to see the now-extinct Dodo.
And if you have rights you must be able to waive them.
The Paracetamol Dilemma
Substitution of paracetamol for aspirin, researchers proposed, may have led to an enhanced allergic immune response, thereby increasing susceptibility to asthma and other allergic disorders.
Since then, a number of epidemiological studies have reported an association between asthma and exposure to paracetamol in the womb, in childhood, and in adulthood.
These studies led to the suggestion that the use of paracetamol may represent an important risk factor in the development of asthma.
The latest evidence to support this hypothesis comes from a large international epidemiological study of childhood asthma that was recently published in the medical journal The Lancet .
This analysis, from the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC), involved more than 200,000 six- and seven-year-old children from 73 centers in 31 countries.
The children's parents or guardians completed written questionnaires about current symptoms of asthma, rhinitis (hayfever), and eczema, and about several risk factors, including use of paracetamol for fever in the child's first year of life and frequency of paracetamol use in the past 12 months.
The study identified that the reported use of paracetamol for fever in the first year of life was associated with symptoms of asthma in the six- and seven-year-old children.
The association was present in all major regions of the world, with an estimated 46% increased risk following adjustment for other risk factors.
A dose-dependent association between asthma symptoms at 6-7 years and paracetamol use in the previous 12 months was also observed.
Similar associations were observed between the use of paracetamol and the risk of severe asthma symptoms.
The proportion of asthma cases that could be attributed to exposure to paracetamol was calculated to be between 22% and 38%.
Paracetamol use both in the first year of life and in children aged 6-7 was also associated with an increased risk of symptoms of rhinitis and eczema.
This suggests that the potential effect of paracetamol is not restricted to the airways and may affect a number of organ systems.
Identifying the potential mechanisms that might underlie the association between paracetamol and asthma (and other allergic disorders) was not a part of this study.
But other researchers have proposed a number of plausible mechanisms, primarily related to paracetamol's negative effect on the body's ability to withstand oxidant stress and its potential enhancement of the allergic immune response.
The authors emphasised that causality could not be established from a retrospective study of this design due to the numerous potential biases that may confound the association.  For example, it is known that viral respiratory tract infections in infancy such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are associated with an increased risk of asthma in later childhood and that paracetamol use for such episodes could have caused confounding in the study.
The study has contributed to the debate as to whether it is beneficial to treat fever in children, an issue comprehensively reviewed by Fiona Russell and colleagues in the Bulletin of the World Health Organization.
They propose that the available scientific evidence suggests that fever is a universal, ancient, and usually beneficial response to infection, and that its suppression under most circumstances has few if any demonstrable benefits. 
On the contrary, they suggest that suppressing fever may occasionally produce harmful effects, and conclude that widespread use of drugs to reduce fever should not be encouraged.
They recommend that in children their use should be restricted to situations of high fever, obvious discomfort, or conditions known to be painful. 
What is agreed is the need for randomized controlled trials of the long-term effects of repeated use of paracetamol in children.
Only then will it be possible to develop evidence-based guidelines for its recommended use.
Pending the results of such research, paracetamol remains the preferred drug to relieve pain and fever in childhood, to be used in accordance with WHO guidelines, which recommend that it should be reserved for children with a high fever (38.5Co or above).
The use of aspirin in young children is contraindicated, owing to the risk of Reye's syndrome, a rare but serious complication.
Paracetamol also remains the preferred drug to relieve pain or fever in children or adults with asthma, because aspirin or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may provoke attacks of asthma in susceptible people with this condition.
The False Promise of Global Governance Standards
The notion of a single set of criteria to evaluate the governance of publicly traded firms worldwide is undoubtedly appealing.
Both investors and publicly traded firms are operating in increasingly integrated global capital markets.
But the quest for a single set of global governance standards is misguided.
Yes, over the last decade, there has been growing use of global governance standards, largely developed in the United States, to assess how countries and companies around the world protect minority investors.
But these efforts have overlooked fundamental differences between controlled companies, which have a controlling shareholder, and widely held firms that lack such a controller.
While widely held firms dominate the capital markets of the US and the UK, controlled companies dominate in most other countries.
Widely held and controlled companies differ considerably in the governance problems their investors face.
In widely held firms, the concern is about opportunism by managers, who exercise de facto control; in controlled firms, the concern is about opportunism by the controlling shareholder at the expense of minority shareholders.
Because the basic governance problems in the two types of firms are considerably different, arrangements that benefit investors in widely held firms might be irrelevant or even counterproductive in controlled firms, and vice versa.
As a result, applying a single standard for assessing investor protection worldwide is bound to miss the mark with respect to widely held firms, controlled firms, or both.
Consider, for example, the Corporate Governance Quotient system, developed by the US firm RiskMetrics, the world's dominant shareholder advisory firm.
RiskMetrics' system, which is used by institutional investors around the world, attaches considerable weight to the arrangements governing contests for control.
These arrangements are, indeed, important for investors in widely held firms.
When a company has a controlling shareholder, however, control contests are not possible, and the arrangements governing such contests are thus irrelevant.
Investors and public officials in countries where controlled companies dominate should stop using global governance standards based on the designers' experience with widely held firms in the US.
Rather, they should strive to develop standards appropriate for controlled firms.
Most obviously, assessments of controlled companies should not give significant weight to arrangements governing contests for corporate control.
Similarly, arrangements that make the firm's board of directors more responsive to the wishes of a majority of shareholders, such as making it easier for shareholders to replace directors, can serve the interests of investors in widely held firms, but are counterproductive for investors in controlled firms.
In controlled firms, where the concern is diversion from minority shareholders, making directors even more responsive to the controller will likely make minority investors still more vulnerable.
Moreover, in countries that have many controlled firms, close attention should be paid to related-party transactions and to the taking of corporate opportunities -- the main ways in which value may be diverted from minority investors in such firms.
To address such problems, arrangements that enable a minority of shareholders to veto related party transactions -- arrangements which are not warranted in widely held firms -- could well be valuable.
Finally, when assessing controlled companies, the independence of directors should not be judged largely by looking at the extent to which they are independent of the company on whose board they serve.
Rather, considerable attention should be given to their independence from the controlling shareholder.
To improve corporate governance and investor protection, public officials and investors in countries whose capital markets are dominated by controlled companies should be wary of global governance standards developed for US companies.
They should focus on the special problems of controlled companies and on the rules that would work best for protecting smaller investors in such companies.
Toxic Tests
Many people have inferred from this sequence of events that US banks -- which are critical to both the American and world economies -- are now out of trouble.
But that inference is seriously mistaken.
In fact, the US stress tests didn't attempt to estimate the losses that banks have suffered on many of the "toxic assets" that have been at the heart of the financial crisis.
Nevertheless, the US model is catching on.
In a meeting this month, finance ministers of G-8 countries agreed to follow the US and perform stress tests on their banks.
But, if the results of such tests are to be reliable, they should avoid the US tests' fundamental flaw.
Until recently, much of the US government's focus has been on the toxic assets clogging banks' balance sheets.
Although accounting rules often permit banks to price these assets at face value, it is generally believed that the fundamental value of many toxic assets has fallen significantly below face value.
The Obama administration came out with a plan to spend up to $1 trillion dollars to buy banks' toxic assets, but the plan has been put on hold.
It might have been hoped that the bank supervisors who stress-tested the banks would try to estimate the size of the banks' losses on toxic assets.
Instead, supervisors estimated only losses that banks can be expected to incur on loans (and other assets) that will come to maturity by the end of 2010. They chose to ignore any losses that banks will suffer on loans that will mature after 2010.
Thus, the tests did not take into account a big part of the economic damage that the crisis imposed on banks.
Although we don't yet have an estimate of the economic losses the stress tests have chosen to ignore, they may be substantial.
According to a recent report by Deutsche Bank, for example, borrowers will have difficulty refinancing hundreds of billions of dollars of commercial real estate loans that will mature after 2010.
Rather than estimate the economic value of banks' assets -- what the assets would fetch in a well-functioning market -- and the extent to which they exceed liabilities, the stress tests merely sought to verify that the banks' accounting losses over the next two years will not exhaust their capital as recorded in their books.
As long as banks are permitted to operate this way, the banks' supervisors are betting on the banks' ability to earn their way out of their current problems -- even if the value of their assets doesn't now significantly exceed their liabilities.
But doesn't the banks' ability to raise new equity capital indicate that, regardless of whether the stress tests are reliable, investors believe that their assets' value does significantly exceed their liabilities?
Not at all.
Consider a bank with liabilities of $1 billion.
Suppose that the bank has assets with long maturity and a face value of $1.2 billion but whose current economic value is only $1 billion.
Although the value of the bank's assets doesn't exceed its liabilities, depositors won't flee as long as the government backs the bank by guaranteeing its deposits.
If in two years the bank's assets have a 50-50 chance of appreciating to $1.2 billion or declining to $0.8 billion, the bank will be able to raise new equity capital: new investors will be willing to pay for the prospect of sharing in the excess of the value of assets over obligations if things turn out well.
To get a good picture of banks' financial health, estimating the value of their toxic assets is unavoidable.
Regulators could encourage each bank to sell part of its toxic portfolio and extrapolate the portfolio's value from the price obtained in such a sale, or they could attempt to estimate the portfolio's value as well as they can on their own.
Either way, the true value of banks' toxic assets must be estimated before concluding that banks are armed with sufficient capital to carry out their critical roles.
The kind of stress tests that the US conducted, and that other countries are being urged to emulate -- and the ability of banks to raise additional equity capital -- cannot provide a basis for such a conclusion.
Let the Good Times Roll Again?
Not without reform.
Indeed, one key lesson of the financial crisis is that an overhaul of executive compensation must be high on the policy agenda.
Indeed, pay arrangements were a major contributing factor to the excessive risk-taking by financial institutions that helped bring about the financial crisis.
By rewarding executives for risky behavior, and by insulating them from some of the adverse consequences of that behavior, pay arrangements for financial-sector bosses produced perverse incentives, encouraging them to gamble.
One major factor that induced excessive risk-taking is that firms' standard pay arrangements reward executives for short-term gains, even when those gains are subsequently reversed.
Although the financial sector lost more than half of its stock-market value during the last five years, executives were still able to cash out, prior to the stock market implosion, large amounts of equity compensation and bonus compensation.
Such pay structures gave executives excessive incentives to seek short-term gains -- say, by making lending and investment decisions that would improve short-term earnings -- even when doing so would increase the risks of an implosion later on.
Following the crisis, this problem has become widely recognized, including by business leaders such as Goldman Sachs' CEO Lloyd Blankfein.
But it still needs to be effectively addressed: Goldman's recent decision to provide record bonuses as a reward for performance in the last two quarters, for example, is a step in the wrong direction.
To avoid rewards for short-term performance and focus on long-term results, pay structures need to be re-designed.
As far as equity-based compensation is concerned, executives should not be allowed to cash out options and shares given to them for a period of, say, five years after the time of "vesting" -- that is, the point at which the options and shares have been "earned" and may not be taken away from the executive.
An executive's inability to cash out shares and options for a substantial period would tie his or her payoff to long-term shareholder value.
The length of this period should be fixed, and should not depend on actions or conditions that are at least partly under executives' control.
By contrast, prohibiting executives from cashing out shares and options until they leave the firm would provide executives who have accumulated shares and options with a large monetary value with counter-productive incentives to depart.
Similarly, bonus compensation should be redesigned to reward long-term performance.
For starters, the use of bonuses based on one-year results should be discouraged.
Furthermore, bonuses should not be paid immediately, but rather placed in a company account for several years and adjusted downward if the company subsequently learns that the reason for awarding a bonus no longer holds up.
In addition to the excessive focus on short-term results, a second important source of incentives to take excessive risks has thus far received little attention.
The payoffs of financial-sector executives were tied to highly leveraged bets on the value of their firms' capital.
Why Financial Pay Shouldn't be Left to the Market
Perhaps not surprisingly, many financial bosses are up in arms over such moves.
They claim that they need the freedom to set compensation packages in order to keep their most talented people -- the ones who will revive the world's financial system.
So, should governments step back and let financial firms reform themselves?
The answer is clearly no.
In the post-crisis financial order, governments must take on the role of monitoring and regulating pay in financial firms; otherwise, the perverse incentives that contributed to the current crisis could easily recur.
It is important to distinguish between two sources of concern about pay in financial firms.
One set of concerns arises from the perspective of shareholders.
Figures recently released by New York's attorney general, Andrew Cuomo, indicate that nine large financial firms paid their employees aggregate compensation exceeding $600 billion in 2003-2008 -- a period in which their aggregate market capitalization substantially declined.
Such patterns may raise concerns among shareholders that pay structures are not well designed to serve their interests.
Even if financial firms have governance problems that produce pay decisions deviating from shareholder interests, however, such problems do not necessarily warrant government regulation of those decisions.
Such problems are best addressed by rules that focus on improving internal governance processes and strengthening investors' rights, leaving the choices that determine compensation structures to corporate boards and the shareholders who elect them.
But pay in financial firms also raises a second important source of concern: even if compensation structures are designed in the interests of shareholders, they may produce incentives for excessive risk-taking that are socially undesirable.
As a result, even if corporate governance problems in financial firms are fully addressed, a government role in regulating their compensation structures may still be warranted.
Suppose that most financial firms could be relied upon by regulators to be run in the interest of their shareholders.
Would this justify exempting these firms from existing regulations that constrain their decisions with respect to lending, investment, or capital reserves?
Clearly not, because shareholders do not bear the full costs of a firm's collapse, and, as the recent crisis demonstrates, the bill for such a downfall must be picked up, at least in part, by taxpayers and the economy.
So shareholders' interests might sometimes be served by business decisions that are too "risky," and regulating such decisions is justified -- indeed, necessary.
Regulation of pay in financial firms is called for by the same reasons that justify the traditional regulations of the firms' business decisions.
The incentives generated by compensation structures determine how firms' managers behave within the boundaries permitted by such traditional, direct regulations.
And as traditional regulation of business decisions is bound to be imperfect, regulating compensation structures can be a useful additional tool to control the risks posed by financial firms' behavior.
If choices of compensation structures can be expected to affect financial firms' stability, regulating these choices can also be useful for protecting this stability.
Financial firms opposed to pay regulation will likely warn against "micro-managing" compensation, and argue that compensation choices must take into account information about each individual manager that regulators are almost certain to lack.
But pay regulation can improve matters without micro-management by setting general standards from which firms may not deviate but that still leave them with significant freedom to account for the individual circumstances of managers.
For example, regulatory standards could require equity-based plans to preclude managers from cashing out awarded shares and options during a certain minimum period after vesting.
In such a case, firms could still remain free to choose the number of shares and options awarded to any given manager, as well as to adjust somewhat the length of the post-vesting period during which cashing out would be precluded. 
Finally, those opposing pay regulation are certain to warn us about "unintended consequences."
But this warning should not carry the day.
We have experienced over the last several years the real and costly consequences of a compensation regime that left financial firms free to set their own pay structures.
Are we to believe that those consequences are preferable to the unintended consequences of pay regulation?
The effort to avoid the harm of flawed compensation decisions in the future should not be deterred by speculative arguments about unintended consequences.
Financial firms should not retain the freedom to create perverse incentives that put all of us at risk.
Should Bondholders be Bailed Out?
It is now widely expected that, when a financial institution is deemed "too big to fail," governments will intervene if it gets into trouble.
But how far should such interventions go?
In contrast to the recent rash of bailouts, future government bailouts should protect only some creditors of a bailed-out institution.
In particular, the government's safety net should never be extended to include the bondholders of such institutions.
In the past, government bailouts have typically protected all contributors of capital of a rescued bank other than shareholders.
Shareholders were often required to suffer losses or were even wiped out, but bondholders were generally saved by the government's infusion of cash.
For example, bondholders were fully covered in the bailouts of AIG, Bank of America, Citigroup, and Fannie Mae, while these firms' shareholders had to bear large losses.
The same was true in government bailouts in the United Kingdom, Continental Europe, and elsewhere.
Bondholders were saved because governments generally chose to infuse cash in exchange for common or preferred shares -- which are subordinate to bondholders' claims -- or to improve balance sheets by buying or guaranteeing the value of assets.
A government may wish to bail out a financial institution and provide protection to its creditors for two reasons.
First, with respect to depositors or other creditors that are free to withdraw their capital on short notice, a protective government umbrella might be necessary to prevent inefficient "runs" on the institution's assets that could trigger similar runs at other institutions.
Second, most small creditors are "non-adjusting," in the sense that they are unable to monitor and study the financial institution's situation when agreeing to do business with it.
To enable small creditors to use the financial system, it might be efficient for the government to guarantee (explicitly or implicitly) their claims.
But, while these considerations provide a basis for providing full protection to depositors and other depositor-like creditors when a financial institution is bailed out, they do not justify extending such protection to bondholders.
Unlike depositors, bondholders generally are not free to withdraw their capital on short notice.
They are paid at a contractually specified time, which may be years away.
Thus, if a financial firm appears to have difficulties, its bondholders cannot stage a run on its assets and how these bondholders fare cannot be expected to trigger runs by bondholders in other companies.
Moreover, when providing their capital to a financial firm, bondholders can generally be expected to obtain contractual terms that reflect the risks they face.
Indeed, the need to compensate bondholders for risks could provide market discipline: when financial firms operate in ways that can be expected to produce increased risks down the road, they should expect to "pay" with, say, higher interest rates or tighter conditions.
But this source of market discipline would cease to work if the government's protective umbrella were perceived to extend to bondholders.
If bondholders knew that the government would protect them, they would not insist on getting stricter contractual terms when they face greater risks.
The problem of "moral hazard" -- which posits that actors will take excessive risks if they do not expect to bear fully the consequences of their actions -- is commonly cited as a reason not to protect shareholders of bailed-out firms.
But it also counsels against protecting firms' bondholders.
Thus, when a large financial firm runs into problems that require a government bailout, the government should be prepared to provide a safety net to depositors and depositor-like creditors, but not to bondholders.
In particular, if the firm's equity capital erodes, the government should not provide funds (directly or indirectly) to increase the cushion available to bondholders.
Rather, bonds should be at least partly converted into equity capital, and any infusion of new capital by the government should be in exchange for securities that are senior to those of existing bondholders.
Governments should not only avoid protecting bondholders after the fact, when the details of a bailout are worked out; but should also make their commitment to this approach clear in advance.
Some of the benefits of a government policy that induces bondholders to insist on stricter terms when financial firms take larger risks would not be fully realized if bondholders believed that the government might protect their interests in the event of a bailout.
In other words, governments should establish bailout policies before the need to intervene arises, rather than make ad hoc decisions when financial firms get into trouble.
The best policy should categorically exclude bondholders from the set of potential beneficiaries of government bailouts.
This would not only eliminate some of the unnecessary costs of government bailouts, but would also reduce their incidence.
Grow Your Own Silicon Valley
SAN FRANCISCO: The dot.com boom may have gone bust for the moment, but that is not stopping governments from wanting to encourage their own high tech industries.
Many countries, indeed, are envious of Silicon Valley outside of San Francisco, the world's center of the computer, software, and Internet industries.
Microsoft's huge investments in Cambridge, England, and the $200 million Bill Gates gave its ancient university for scholarships for technology students from around the world, helped Cambridge become a powerful center of technological innovation.
Cities and university towns everywhere now want to get into the act.
Indeed, across Europe and in Asia other nations have either started, or are considering offering state subsidies to encourage the growth of their own high tech clusters.
After observing Silicon Valley during my many years at the Hoover Institution of Stanford University, however, I am convinced that dynamic industrial clusters require a flexible economic environment, not government industrial policy.
Silicon Valley started in the 1950's with a modest plan by Frederick Terman, a farsighted dean of Stanford's Engineering School, to create an Industrial Park on unused Stanford land.
A few companies took up Stanford's offer, but the area was still sleepy and unimpressive when I first visited Stanford in the early 1960's.
The region took off in the 1970's with Apple's development of the personal computer, and it has exploded since then following the creation of the Internet and the enormous demand for software.
Silicon Valley now employs over 1 million persons, almost 40% have at least a bachelor's degree, and more than one third are foreign born.
They are attracted by the good jobs with excellent prospects, and by the early access to frontier developments in the high tech field.
Silicon Valley is loaded with startup companies, and with former startups like Intel and Cisco Systems that grew very big, very fast.
Venture capitalists invested over $6 billion in 1999 in new or young Valley companies, and 77 companies had IPOs, mainly related to the Internet.
The most prestigious individuals in this Valley are those who can claim they work in "startups".
Faculty and graduates from the strong science and engineering departments of two nearby major universities, Stanford and the University of California at Berkeley, have been leaders in forming dynamic startups.
Although good universities may be necessary to develop these industrial clusters, they are not sufficient.
Other regions with strong science and engineering universities, such as the University of Illinois at Urbana, do not have many high tech companies.
Whatever got Silicon Valley going, its advantages in attracting quality labor and venture capital multiplied as the region grew.
A large pool of engineers, scientists, and software experts are available to both new and old companies.
Talented individuals flock to the region not only because of generous options and decent pay, but also because they know they can find other good jobs if their employers fail.
So while job changes are common in the Valley, unemployment rates are extremely low.
Innovations and other new developments spread rapidly in Silicon Valley, partly carried by the employees who change jobs.
As Alfred Marshall, a great British economist of the late 19th century recognized, when companies in related industries locate near each other, Athe mysteries of the trade become no mysteries; but are as it were in the air".
This makes it difficult to keep secrets, but at the same time companies have early access to innovations by neighbors.
Silicon Valley's labor market flexibility indicates that nations that want to encourage high tech clusters should make it easy to hire and lay off workers rather than mandate substantial severance pay, or legislate limits on working hours.
Companies have stronger incentives to hire added workers when they are formed or expand if they can reduce employment when demand turns down.
The US has relatively few obstacles to starting new companies, raising private capital, or going public.
It also allows key employees to be hired with potentially valuable stock options that economize on out of pocket expenses.
Although several countries have begun to reduce the red tape that hampers the formation and financing of new companies, most have a long way to go in appreciating and encouraging entrepreneurial activities.
For example, reducing artificial obstacles to starting a company is far different from the generous subsidy programs started recently by Germany and other countries desperate for more dynamic economies.
Subsidies generate "safe" startups that appeal to bureaucrats rather than to market demand.
The tremendous spontaneity found in Silicon Valley could never be reproduced through bureaucratic greenhouse support.
Silicon Valley clearly grew over time with little help from government.
Indeed, the major attempt to help actually hurt the region.
For the U.S.-Japan Semiconductor Agreement of 1986 that imposed "antidumping" restrictions on imports of semiconductors from Japan slowed the shift of Silicon Valley toward software and other higher valued added products and services.
It is unlikely that industrial policies toward the high tech sector by other nations will be any wiser than America's failed policy of that time.
Where dynamic industrial clusters locate is partly due to luck and accident.
But Silicon Valley's history indicates that top universities, flexible labor and capital markets, and limited regulatory obstacles to entrepreneurship all help attract high tech companies.
The Third Way is A Rightwing Way
CHICAGO: "Only de Gaulle could free Algeria; only Nixon could open up China." Behind these slogans rests an notable principle: self-interest often causes political parties to radically depart from, even to abandon, their traditional ideologies.
This insight is particularly useful in Europe, and increasingly around the globe, when examining the actions of supposedly leftwing and socialist governments.
In the late 1950s France came near to civil war over Algeria.
Out of power since 1946, Charles de Gaulle was summoned back to the Elysée to lead France out of this quagmire.
Because of his patriotism, de Gaulle seemed the only man able to set Algeria free.
Starting in the late 1960's rapprochement between Mao's China and America became possible because China was involved in political and military conflicts with the Soviet Union.
America's Democrats knew this as well as the Republicans, but President Johnson was afraid to approach China because his party was supposedly soft on communism.
Only a dedicated anti-Communist like Nixon had sufficient political support from the right to visit China and urge cooperation between the US and China against their common enemy in the Kremlin.
Economics is not immune from this dynamic.
Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher successfully promoted lower income taxes, privatization of government enterprises, weaker unions, and a generally smaller role for government.
The popularity and success of their programs induced liberal, labor, and social democratic governments in many nations to also promote free market policies in direct conflict with their traditional ideologies.
Often, only these parties have sufficient political support on the left to succeed in introducing needed reforms in labor and other markets.
Market reforms initiated by the left started in 1984 with a New Zealand labor government which enacted legislation that transformed a small formerly isolated nation into one of the most "liberal" economies in the world.
New Zealand's Laborites privatized the postal system and many other public enterprises, and changed the country's employment system from highly centralized collective bargaining to one that gave employers considerable discretion to hire and fire and to pay market-determined wages.
The Democratic Party of the US has in the past strongly supported big government, but under President Bill Clinton it took heed of the popularity of the Republican Party's stance advocating less paternalism and smaller government.
It was President Clinton, not Bush or Reagan, who declared that "the era of big government was over" as his administration radically reversed traditional Democratic positions on welfare, balanced budgets, public debt reduction, and the encouragement of business.
A telling example of this trend is found in Mexico's economic policies of the 1980's and 1990's.
The Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) that governed Mexico uninterrupted for seven decades (until its recent loss of the presidency to Vincente Fox) had been a strong advocate of government ownership of heavy industry, prohibitive duties on imports to protect domestic companies, and detailed regulation of labor and financial markets.
Starting with President Miguel de la Madrid in the early 1980's, however, the PRI responded to free market critics of Mexico's weak economic performance by selling many government-owned enterprises, partially privatizing the Mexican social security system, and becoming a strong advocate of a free trade agreement with its large "enemy" to the north, the US.
So President Fox needs only to continue this revolution, not start his own.
Argentina's Senate recently reacted to very high unemployment by passing a labor market reform bill that cuts union power and gives employers flexibility in hiring and firing.
This reform is being promoted by the new center-left government of Fernando de la Rua after the failure of attempts to reform the labor market by the previous conservative government of Carlos Menem.
But it is recent policy changes in Germany and France that provide, perhaps, the most impressive examples of the "de Gaulle/Algeria" and "Nixon/China" theory of political reform.
Both nations suffered high unemployment and slow growth during the 1990's, in good measure due to heavy-handed regulation of labor and other markets.
Conservative governments in these nations accomplished little in the way of serious market reform, despite considerable rhetoric.
The Jospin and Schroeder governments were elected on manifestos that promised to cut unemployment and raise growth by expanding government regulation.
Each regime did in fact start out by introducing more government controls - including a law to implement a 35 hour week in France.
Both governments, however, soon -- and quite stealthily -- reversed course.
Gerhard Schroeder in Germany has now slashed corporate taxes, is encouraging startup companies, and promises to provide tax breaks for private pension plans.
French Premier Jospin quietly liberalized the French labor market by allowing for more part-time work, increased privatization, and promoted a more globally competitive financial system with reduced governmental control.
If Nixon could seek agreement with Communist China, and de Gaulle surrender Algeria, it is a relatively small step for Socialists to embrace the free market and support much lower taxes on business.
In politics as in life, ideology is usually overwhelmed by self-interest.
On Censorship in Hong Kong
No jackboots are to be seen marching through Hong Kong's sleek shopping malls, but a distinct whiff of totalitarianism is in the air.
The tell-tale phrases are on everyone's lips: talk of the need for anti-subversion laws, press controls, strong leadership, of adjusting to Hong Kong's new reality.
Everyone looks to the great Northern neighbor for direction and mutters about expediency.
Most of the world lost interest in Hong Kong after 1997 when the "Anschluss" with China did not instantly deliver vast changes.
Over the last year or two, however, the pace of integration into the People's Republic of China has quickened decisively.
Life at the South China Morning Post , Hong Kong's leading English language newspaper, and so a visible political gauge, offers a window into what is going on all across Hong Kong's institutions.
The atmosphere at the paper began to darken noticeably as one after another of its leading editorial lights was pushed out.
It would be an exaggeration to compare the situation to the way the Nazis took over institutions in Germany in the 1930s, and to how people back then fell in line, because no one is disappearing into concentration camps.
Hong Kong remains a rich and prosperous place.
Yet the dictatorship in Beijing has made its presence felt, if only through proxies and collaborators.
Before I chose to protest to the editor who sacked me a week ago, I was guilty of complicity too.
I stayed silent when the paper's popular cartoonist (Larry Feign) was unjustly dismissed, and remained silent even after its best satirical writer (Nury Vittachi) was sacked.
I only became uneasy when the British editor (Jonathan Fenby) was fired and replaced.
"I am still OK," I reasoned. "They still let me write what I want..."
My job as bureau chief in Beijing isolated me from the struggles in the head office in distant Hong Kong.
Besides, working in Beijing is itself a constant struggle of conscience and compromise.
Foreign reporters are under constant surveillance and risk compromising their contacts.
That means one begins to avoid tough subjects, like the repression of Falun Gong and its followers.
Gradually, you also noticed a change in the behavior of your HK colleagues.
As the government proposed to introduce an anti-subversion law and strengthened its control over the civil service, they became guarded in what they said and tightlipped about mentioning the pressures from above.
Whispered rumors of daily interference from management were only confirmed in private.
Some people responded opportunistically, seeing the way to promotion open as talented colleagues disappeared.
So the internationally recognized editor, Willy Lam, was replaced by a mainlander, Wang Xiangwei.
Those who organized this coup hoped that it would lead to greater things for themselves; those who signed a petition of protest were fired not long after.
Management then began to quietly spread word that the paper needed people able to "negotiate" with the sensibilities of the Communist Party.
Curiously, some officials in Beijing complained about the crude tactics of those sent to run Hong Kong.
It seemed the urge to collaborate actually ran ahead of the party's demands.
The paper's tone began to change, becoming increasingly deferential toward China's rulers.
Reporting became blander and blander.
Management talked of the virtues of writing to allow readers to read between the lines.
These changes speeded up over recent months.
Even the office photographer began to notice different photographic choices.
The Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office took charge of the paper's correspondents based on the mainland, demanding that they be replaced by ethnic Chinese.
Then they began to offer guidance on reporting in exchange for favors like access to officials.
Despite the obviousness as to where all this was leading, individuals responded differently.
Some continued to deny what was happening, and became indignant if the issue was raised.
Others reasoned that if they kept their head down and compromised, the crisis would pass.
A sort of listlessness now grips Hong Kong, particularly the civil service.
The business sector remains unaffected and continues to talk optimistically of the prospects opened up by closer integration with the mainland.
But Hong Kong is surrendering the uniqueness and exceptional position it once held over the Chinese world.
As other Chinese cities become more free and more confident, Hong Kong is submissively abandoning the freedoms it once held with pride.
In 1997, China promised to preserve these freedoms for 50 years under the one county, two systems mantra.
Now Hong Kong itself is undoing the system.
Many of its tycoons (one of whom, Robert Kuok, controls the South Morning China Post ) are jettisoning their autonomy for the sake of business - even when such action is not requested.
They seem blind to the value of what they are sacrificing.
The intangibles of freedom will determine the vitality and future of Hong Kong.
Tragically, such losses never appear on the profit sheets measured by accountants.
The Poverty of Thinking About Poverty
The World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg is, as expected, contemplating numerous bold promises, but the meeting itself is doomed to be an exercise in futility.
For if we mean by `development' human development in its widest sense, the only development that is sustainable is one that enables people to live together in peace and with respect for basic human rights.
There is very little scope for international action to eliminate the violation of these rights in many - if not most - countries of the world today, particularly those that are trying to turn the `Earth Summit' into a sounding board for criticism of the failure of advanced countries to do more to eradicate world poverty or to protect the environment.
At least we should welcome the fact that these two topics - poverty and the environment - are the two main themes of the Earth Summit.
This is a retreat from the usual fixations of the earlier sustainable development pressure groups, such the supposed exhaustion of raw materials for growth, or the sheer technical inability of the world to feed its expanding population, or biodiversity.
The wild exaggerations of environmental activists are at last being seen through by most informed commentators.
The laws of economics state that when the demand for a commodity begins to outstrip supply the price will rise.
Leaving aside short-term speculative markets, demand will then decrease and supply (including the supply of substitutes) will increase.
These laws have ensured that none of the doomsday scenarios of the 1960s and 1970s - remember the forecasts of the "Club of Rome"? - have come to pass.
Indeed, in the long run, prices of almost all minerals have followed a downward trend.
The world can never run out of any mineral resources.
Similarly alarmist predictions about imminent worldwide famine have also been falsified.
Famines do occur, of course, but rarely, if ever, in genuinely democratic countries.
From the days of Soviet collectivization in the 1930s down to President Mugabe's racist policies in Zimbabwe today, famines result from civil wars or ideological lunacies.
Local climate change can, of course, exacerbate the situation, but given the scope for world trade and the existence of surpluses in many food producing areas, democratic governments can deal with the consequences.
As for biodiversity, the most important species threatened with extinction today is the human race.
True, international action can help to deal with the twin problems of poverty and environmental degradation.
For example, rich countries should reduce agricultural subsidies and open up their markets more to Third World food exports.
International action can also help deal with global environmental problems.
There are many examples of such action, such as the Montreal Protocol to help reduce the threat to the ozone layer.
So it is unfortunate that America abandoned the Kyoto process for combating global warming, instead of trying to move that process toward sensible market-based solutions and away from the regulatory mechanism beloved of bureaucrats everywhere.
But a reduction in poverty and environmental degradation - such as lack of access to clean drinking water - that affect the lives of billions of people in the Third World will always depend chiefly on local policies.
These include, above all, increased respect for the rule of law, for property rights, for freedom for people to take advantage of their entrepreneurial spirit and to express their discontent with their lot, not to mention other basic freedoms set out in numerous international conventions to which almost all the countries participating in the Earth Summit are signatories and which many flagrantly ignore.
Greater respect for human rights is not, of course, merely a desirable means towards the ends of poverty reduction and environmental protection.
It also happens to be an important - often the most important - item of human welfare and development.
The events of the last twelve months have surely driven home to most people that the most dangerous conflict facing humanity in the future is not the conflict between Man and the environment, but between Man and Man.
Unfortunately, given the respect accorded to national sovereignty, the scope for international action to improve respect for basic human rights in the many countries where they are violated is limited.
For this reason, whatever fine, ringing pronouncement, do emerge from the Earth Summit, they are doomed to failure.
New Europe Catches Old Europe's Cold
Two countries -- Hungary and Ukraine -- have already asked for large packages of support.
Several more could do so over the next month if frozen credit markets do not thaw.
If the situation continues until the end of the year, which cannot be ruled out, many more countries could experience serious banking crises.
Over the last two decades, Eastern Europe has undertaken wide-ranging reforms and embraced global financial integration.
Foreign, mostly European, banks have entered these markets with unprecedented speed and force.
These banks have increasingly reached out to more risky small- and medium-sized enterprises and helped people buy their own houses and start new businesses.
But successful financial development is now coming back to haunt these countries.
Until now, the countries of emerging Europe withstood the global financial squeeze remarkably well, coping with the slowdown in important export markets and increased borrowing costs.
But no open economy can resist a complete shutdown of the lending markets.
Perhaps they became too dependent on cheap credit, but they were not alone in this respect.
Some foreign banks are now withdrawing liquid funds from subsidiaries in emerging Europe.
According to the National Bank of Russia, foreign banks withdrew more than $10 billion in that country in September alone.
Other central banks make similar claims.
To be fair, Raiffeisen International has announced that it was supporting its Ukrainian subsidiary, Bank Aval, with an additional €180 million.
Whether other parent banks active in the region stand by their subsidiaries depends on how severe the crisis in Western Europe becomes.
But the Western European bailout packages could make the situation in emerging Europe worse.
While most parent banks in the region are likely to benefit from these measures, this does not necessarily translate into support for their foreign subsidiaries.
In fact, there is a serious risk that these bailouts will come at the expense of Eastern Europe.
Several governments have declared that taxpayer money cannot go into operations abroad.
Governments in emerging Europe should, of course, play their part in stabilizing their financial systems.
But at this point there are severe limits to what they can do.
Most do not have the financial clout to counter the extraordinary pressures from financial markets.
An offer by Hungary's government to extend a general guarantee of deposits or to ensure liquidity in interbank markets has limited credibility.
To survive this crisis, emerging Europe needs support from outside.
First and foremost, West European leaders must ensure that the crisis is resolved at the core, and many observers doubt that they have done enough.
Second, they must prevent the crisis measures already taken from discriminating against subsidiaries in Central and Eastern Europe, independently of whether they are within or outside the European Union.
Third, they must combine forces, as in Hungary, with international financial institutions in supporting these economies.
Georgia's experiences following its recent war with Russia offer a possible model.
The International Monetary Fund provided an emergency credit line to support the currency, the World Bank coordinated the relief effort (much of it financed by the United States and the EU), and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development used its knowledge and resources to lead the effort to save the financial system.
The Georgia package is not a done deal, and circumstances elsewhere are different, but it shows that standard instruments can go a long way.
Yet more resources and new instruments will be needed.
The case of Hungary shows that the EU can tweak an existing instrument -- balance-of-payment support -- and use it creatively.
For non-EU countries, like Turkey and Ukraine, innovative ideas are also urgently needed.
There should be no doubt about what is at stake.
It is has been little noticed, but in the last few years, Eastern Europe, including Russia, surpassed the US and the United Kingdom as the euro zone's most important export markets.
Many of these markets now face slowdown or even negative growth.
Moreover, Western European companies have invested on a previously unimaginable scale.
There is a serious risk that, if the crisis becomes even worse, East European governments will see no alternative but to nationalize some institutions, particularly some of the foreign-controlled banks.
But, even more importantly, decades of financial development and broad economic reforms could unravel.
As in Western Europe and the US, governments will again play a larger role in the economy, but state involvement has different connotations in these former socialist economies, particularly as they now face a backlash against financial development and against reformers.
As if this was not enough, Western governments and businesses should ponder what kind of offers may come from Russian sources, private or public, for distressed banks and companies.
No doubt with strings attached.
What's Left of Confucianism?
But heroic rescue efforts will not be able to help the government forever, so it is worth asking what can provide long-term political legitimacy.
After all, communism has lost its capacity to inspire the Chinese.
So what should replace it?
Most Westerners think the answer is liberal democracy, as did many Chinese liberals in the twentieth century.
But there is another answer, which takes the form of the old and venerable tradition of Confucianism, which is being revived by government officials, critical intellectuals, and ordinary citizens.
The opening ceremony of the Olympic games will highlight this revival: it will feature not quotes from Marx, but sayings from the Analects of Confucius.
Such sayings as "The world's peoples are all brothers" and "Isn't one of life's greatest pleasures to have friends visiting from afar?" will be beamed to billions worldwide, expressing the best that Chinese culture has to offer.
Here, however, we run into trouble.
Ever since the Han dynasty (more than 2,000 years ago), Chinese governments have manipulated the most prominent political interpretations of Confucianism for their own purposes.
Confucianism has been combined with Legalism, China's other main political tradition, to justify such practices as blind obedience to the ruler, subordination of women, and the use of harsh punishments. The "official" Confucianism being revived today may be less dangerous -- it emphasizes social harmony, meaning the peaceful resolution of conflicts -- but it remains a conservative morality.
But there is another interpretation of Confucianism -- let's call it "left Confucianism" -- that stresses intellectuals' obligation to criticize bad policies, obliges governments to provide for the people's material well-being and support those without key family relations, and calls for governments to adopt a more international-minded outlook and to rely on moral power rather than military might to pursue political aims.
It leaves open basic metaphysical commitments and takes a plural and tolerant view of religious life.
It emphasizes equality of opportunity in education as well as meritocracy in government, with leadership positions being distributed to the community's most virtuous and qualified members.
Such values owe their origin to the "original Confucianism" of Confucius, Mencius, and Xunzi, which existed before Confucianism became established as state orthodoxy.
In imperial times, the critical tradition was carried forward by such scholars as Huang Zongxi.
Today, new Confucian leftists such as Gan Yang are calling for the creation of a "Confucian socialist republic."
Confucian scholars such as Jiang Qing openly acknowledge that their interpretation of Confucianism most closely parallels socialist ideals: not the "actually existing socialism" in today's China, but the socialist ideals defended by Karl Marx and others.
This Confucian tradition aims to influence contemporary politics, but it also remains separate from state power and orthodoxy, always ready to point to the gap between ideals and reality.
Indeed, left Confucianism's departure from the status quo is precisely the point: it is meant to provide a moral standard for social critics and to inspire visions of a more desirable political future.
Unlike communism, it offers a future that derives its legitimacy from tradition and building upon what the past has to offer -- including the socialist tradition -- rather than destroying it.
Thus, left Confucians favor institutional reform, arguing that the long-term stability and legitimacy of political institutions requires that they be founded on Chinese traditions.
Jiang Qing advocates a tri-cameral legislature -- a democratically elected People's House representing the common people's interests, a House of Exemplary Persons to secure the good of all those affected by government policies, including foreigners and minority groups, and a House of Cultural Continuity that would maintain China's various religions and traditions.
Such concrete proposals for political reform inspired by Confucian values can rarely be published in mainland China.
In fact, there are fewer constraints imposed on public discussion of liberal-democratic institutions precisely because few Chinese are inspired by Western-style liberal democracy.
Today, the most viable alternative to China's political status quo is left Confucianism.
Sadat's Journey, 30 Years After
From that moment, the question for the Arabs was no longer how to destroy Israel, but how to reach an accomodation with it.
In his dramatic leap into the future, Sadat taught Arab leaders the realities of a changing world.
For Sadat's peace overture was born out of a sober strategic analysis of the regional balance of power.
It was clear to him that Israel was a nuclear power that, in October 1973, had once again proven itself to be unbeatable in a conventional war -- a war Sadat himself had never expected to win when he launched it.
Understanding Clausewitz's dictum that war is a continuation of politics by other means, Sadat had sent the Egyptian Army across the Suez Canal in order to unleash a peace process.
He was defeated militarily, but his decision to go to Jerusalem meant that he would succeed politically.
During all of their abortive attempts to destroy Israel, the Arabs had relied on the military backing of the Soviet Union.
But a strategy of peace with Israel, Sadat knew, required an alliance with the United States.
This alliance was so vital an objective for Sadat that one may rightly wonder what came first in his strategy.
Perhaps Sadat might have opted to secure the American alliance without making peace with Israel if he had been able to do so.
But he could not, and he knew it.
Indeed, in 1974, when General Gamasy, the architect of the 1973 war, questioned Sadat's flexibility in the disengagement talks with Israel, Egypt's president calmed him down by saying, "Don't forget, General, we are talking here about peace with the Americans!"
Another shift implicit in Sadat's strategy was to keep Egypt at a distance from pan-Arabism.
Weary of inter-Arab politics, and tired of the high price Egypt had paid for the Palestinian cause, Sadat wanted to move away from Nasser's pan-Arab ambitions and an excessive focus on the question of Palestine toward an emphasis on Egypt's role as a power lying at the strategic crossroads between Asia and Africa.
Sadat would, of course, continue to champion the Palestinian cause as the heart of an Arab consensus and sometimes as a fig leaf for his own Egypt-focused foreign policy.
But, for all practical purposes, Sadat had embarked on a path leading to a separate peace with Israel.
One lesson of Sadat's initiative is that in protracted conflicts where deep emotions and historical hatreds are involved, when almost every conceivable diplomatic formula has been tried and failed, the shock of a visionary, generous, and imaginative step can open new paths.
The major problem in the Arab-Isreli conflict, as in many other intricate disputes, has always been the incapacity or unwillingness of leaders to conduct a peace policy that is not supported by their societies' prevailing, and frequently paralyzing, consensus.
Leaders, more often than not, are hostage to the socio-political environment that produces them, rather than its shapers.
Sadat gained a privileged place in history and achieved immortality the moment he fled from the comfortable prison of inertia, and from the pantomime solidarity and hollow rhetorical cohesion of Arab summits.
The test of statesmanship did not end there.
Sadat's spectacular leap into the future needed to be met by Israel's prime minister, Menachem Begin, at almost every juncture down a tortuous road to peace.
Arguably, only a political "hawk" like Begin, a man with a keen sense of the dramatic and a political romantic with a beady eye to the judgment of history, could have responded in such a way to Sadat's initiative.
That Begin was able to rise to the occasion had much to do with the psychological impact of Sadat's astonishing initiative.
Through his visit to Jerusalem, Sadat made more ordinary the nature of the Arab-Israeli conflict.
Sadat's initiative transformed the conflict from a fight about Israel's right to exist into a negotiation of interests between legitimate sovereign states.
Here, indeed, is the central point: the need to move away from mythological, mutually exclusive rights of existence, conflicting historical narratives, and religious claims of ownership.
Sadly, this is where the Palestinian-Israeli tragedy remains stuck to this very day, thus making the conflict practically insoluble.
Through his visit to Jerusalem, Sadat shook away Israel's siege mentality and gave psychological living space to an otherwise claustrophobic nation in the midst of a hostile Arab world.
Peace is never a zero-sum game.
In its peace with Israel, Egypt reached its strategic objective of an alliance with the US.
But Israel was wrong to believe that Egypt could be a gateway into the Arab world.
The gate to Israeli-Arab reconciliation remains where it was always been -- in the hands of the Palestinians.
Britain's New Internationalism
The United States' staunchest ally since 2001, Great Britain, has already gone down this path, divorcing itself from its servile alliance with a Bush administration that focused on war and confrontation.
Though only a miniature version of America's imperial predicament, Britain's current policy, as its new prime minister, Gordon Brown, is defining it, may anticipate the direction taken by the next American president.
Tony Blair's endorsement of Bush's Middle East designs showed that an imbalance of power in an alliance always causes the weaker partner to become subservient.
Britain joined America's Iraq adventure with the same inflated perceptions of its military capacity and diplomatic clout that trapped Bush.
But Britain's military contribution to the war effort was not indispensable, so Bush did not have to heed Blair's advice.
As a result, Britain could not serve as a bridge between a doubtful Europe and a belligerent US, as Blair believed, and Britain's capacity to be a force for good on the world stage was severely damaged.
Like America, Britain has learned the hard way the limits of what sheer military power can achieve, and also the devastating implications of its misuse for its reputation in the Muslim world and beyond.
The scope and virulence of anti-British sentiment in the Muslim world are now second only to that facing the US.
Restoring Britain's reputation in the region will take years of hard work.
Blair's legacy has thrown Brown into a confusing oscillation between Britain's transatlantic tradition and its European connections.
No longer an independent global power, yet unhappy with the London-Washington axis that Blair forged, Brown's government continues to waffle in its commitment to a united Europe.
Indeed, Brown, for whom America remains "Britain's most important bilateral relationship," recently blocked his foreign secretary, David Miliband, from delivering a speech that he considered excessively pro-Europe.
But such uncertainty, common in times of transition, should not overshadow what the end of the Blair-Bush era in Britain holds in store.
Unilateralism and pre-emptive wars are to be replaced by what Brown defines as "an agenda for a hard-headed internationalism," based on cooperation with multilateral agencies and alliances -- the United Nations, NATO, the European Union, and the British Commonwealth.
The new policy seems to shift emphasis to "soft power" strategy aimed at projecting Britain as a global economic and cultural hub.
The City of London, the British Council, Oxfam, and the BBC are now expected to restore the prominence of Britain's enduring values.
Conspicuously, it is no longer the British, but France's government under President Nicolas Sarkozy, that is carrying the torch of a possible attack on Iran's nuclear installations.
But, for Brown's policy to succeed, it must promote social change and political reform in the Arab world.
That means abandoning Blair's strategy of confronting the "arc of extremism" with putative "moderates" who, besides offering lucrative markets for arms sales, are in fact autocrats whose conduct has helped fuel the growth of radical Islam.
The "extremists" versus "moderates" language has served only to revive colonial memories in the region and divide it even more deeply.
Post-Blair Britain is becoming a country for which wars that lack international legitimacy can only presage defeat and moral decay.
Of course, international legitimacy can be a vacuous concept when not backed by the capacity to use effective force.
Now incapable of intimidating anyone, Britain has opted for developing its potential to inspire.
Unfortunately, inspiration, too, requires the threat of effective military power to be an effective force for change.
Notwithstanding its many setbacks in recent years, the US remains the only power capable of leading a global strategy that consists in balancing soft and hard power.
May the next American president pursue this course.
Arab Fathers and Sons
Years of Western-backed repressive authoritarianism nipped in the bud any potential growth of a liberal alternative to the incumbent Arab regimes, and turned any abrupt move to free elections into a dangerous exercise in Islamic democracy.
A democracy that produces governments led by Hamas, Hezbollah, or the Muslim Brotherhood is inevitably bound to be anti-Western and opposed to an American-inspired "peace process" with Israel.
Syria has already sought to assure regime continuity through quasi-monarchic hereditary succession with the move from Hafez al-Assad to his son Bashar.
There are indications that Egypt might follow suit, with Hosni Mubarak's son, Gamal, taking over.
Likewise, Libya's Muammar Khaddafi may be succeeded by his son, Seif el Islam.
As products of revolutionary military takeovers, these secular nationalist regimes failed to produce genuine popular legitimacy and have had to fall back on the dynastic succession practiced by the regimes they toppled.
The centrality of hereditary succession in the quest for peace and stability was shown by Hafez al-Assad when he agreed to unprecedented good will gestures aimed at drawing Ehud Barak's Israeli government into a peace deal.
An old and sick man who was to die a few months later, he acted with a sense of urgency to reach a deal that would relieve his inexperienced son of the burden of struggling for the recovery of the Golan Heights.
Bashar Assad remains essentially loyal to his father's legacy.
Not unlike North Korea's and Iran's defiant nuclear policies, Bashar's membership in the region's "axis of evil" is a call for dialogue with America, not an invitation to an invasion, and for a settlement with Israel, not a drive to wage war on it.  
In Egypt, Mubarak turned his back on the lofty rhetoric of Gamal Abdel-Nasser's revolution and its grand strategic designs.
Stability is at the heart of his thinking.
Hence, he could not accept America's awkward pro-democracy agenda.
But he was more than willing to occupy center stage in Arab diplomacy's support of the Annapolis peace conference.
After all, the passion that the Palestinians' plight evokes among ordinary Egyptians is a dangerous source of instability.
Mubarak's succession is being conducted in an especially sophisticated manner.
His son's ascension, unlike that of Bashar on the eve of his father's death, is anything but settled.
But, by being allowed to acquire popular legitimacy and a high degree of acceptance within the political establishment as the driving force behind the ruling party's preparations for the post-Mubarak era, Gamal is being positioned strategically to compete effectively for the presidency.
He is widely credited for setting the country's agenda, and for being the motor behind the liberal economic reforms that since 2004 have meant a qualitative leap in the Egyptian economy.
It may be, as President Mubarak's critics argue, that the faltering progress of democratization reflects the attempt to block all potential challengers to Gamal.
But, with the decline of secular nationalism and Islamism's rise, the hidden electoral power of the Muslim Brotherhood poses a mortal threat to the regime and its strategic alliance with the West.
As a result, the regime refuses to take any chances.
Nor was Muammar Khaddafi's decision to stop being an international pariah entirely unrelated to his concern to bequeath to his son a state that lives in peace with the world.
His abysmal human rights record remains, but the flamboyant "Guide of the Revolution" ceased flirting with weapons of mass destruction and global terrorism in exchange for the end of sanctions and international rehabilitation.
A sick man whose rule at home is being challenged by Islamist opponents, he decided that international ostracism and domestic troubles is too explosive a combination for his son, a spoiled playboy, to handle.
Algeria is an especially difficult case.
The last of the revolutionary generation, President Abdulaziz Buteflika must still conceive a succession that ends his country's civil war.
Fully-fledged democracy might lead to victory for Islamists, as it did in 1991.
A transition to democracy in the old revolutionary Arab regimes will not correspond to a Western model, nor can it be imposed by American F-16's.
But, as countries like Egypt, Syria, and Lybia might be indicating, hereditary succession is not an inherently reactionary move.
Rather, it means opting for a controlled transition to a post-revolutionary phase in which economic modernization and international integration might usher in greater political change in the future.
An Alliance of Civilizations?
Co-sponsored by Spain and Turkey, the Alliance of Civilizations initiative is not devoid of political calculation.
To the Spaniards, it helps to justify their abrupt withdrawal from Iraq in 2004; for the Turks, it is yet another vehicle in their struggle, as the vital bridge between Islam and the West, for admission into the European Union.
A loose and somewhat confused project, the Alliance of Civilizations aims to heal the wounds of conflict between Islam and the West through education, viable integration policies, and a better-informed dialogue with the media.
But it suffers from the major global players' profound skepticism, with the US, Russia, and, for that matter, the EU shown no real enthusiasm for it.
However vague, the alliance of civilizations idea certainly cannot do more harm than war against Islamic extremism.
After all, none of the Muslim world's problems and conflicts with the West are susceptible to a military solution.
Moreover, the Alliance is not an entirely incoherent proposal if the objective is that the West disengage from the politics of hubris and establish a genuine sphere of cooperation with the Muslim world in economics, culture, and science.
Of course, the idea is held back by the inner workings of both parts of the proposed alliance.
Many in the West question whether Islam is compatible with human rights and Western concepts of liberty.
Many Muslims who have been fighting for years for  their countries' modernization have so far failed to find a lucid response to the progressive wave of radical Islam.
To claim that Islam is incompatible with human rights is to consider it a civilization too hidebound to change.
This is a historic fallacy.
Nor is the claim that Islam is intrinsically inimical to innovation viable, because Muslim civilization has contributed mightily to science and art throughout history.
Today, Western universities are replete with distinguished Arab scholars in almost every field -- the result of a brain drain that itself reflects the Islamic world's centuries of decline.
In 2005, the 17 countries of the Arab world together produced 13,444 scientific publications, fewer than the 15,455 achieved by Harvard University alone.
Enemies of reason, however, are also to be found in the West.
We live in an age in which many people are disillusioned with secular politics, and are turning to religion instead, not only throughout the Muslim world, but in the core of Western civilization, Christian Europe and Evangelist America.
Nor is the Jewish state of Israel, where Messianic fanatics and religious nationalists have embraced a political theology that questions the very legitimacy of the democratic institutions, immune from this phenomenon.
The current crisis of Islam might not be congenital, but Islam's predicament is acute.
The question is this: are Muslims ready to accept that Khomeini's dictum that "Islam is politics or it is nothing" is wrong, that Islam is a religion and not a form of government, and that, as in the Christian world, there is a sphere for Caesar and a sphere for God?
Those in the Muslim world who want to embrace reform must be driven by the conviction that theocracy has never served as a vehicle for human progress.
Of course, the Alliance of Civilizations should not attempt to bridge differences by defending moral relativism.
If it is driven by a Western guilt complex that assumes that the solution simply lies in greater empathy for the Muslim predicament, then the skeptics are bound to be vindicated.
For the Alliance of Civilizations to have any chance of success, the emphasis must be on reciprocity.
Tolerance and religious freedom must be mutual.
Islam's part in the deal must include a guarantee of human rights and civil liberties, improvement in women's status, and realistic policies to stem the Islamic world's demographic explosion.
Some, as usual, will claim that the Arab-Israeli conflict lies at the root of the problems that exist between Islam and the West, and that resolving the Palestinians' plight will contribute immensely to smoother relations.
But Arabs and Muslims must stop deluding themselves that the Israel-Palestine dispute is what is holding them back.
Ending the American occupation in Iraq and imposing an Arab-Israeli peace would help, but they are no panacea.
The fight to eradicate misery, illiteracy, and corruption, and Islam's embrace of science, do not depend on the results of the Middle East peace process.
Rescuing Annapolis
But the deeper problem lies elsewhere, in the poverty of the leadership, and in the fragmentation of Palestinian politics.
Indeed, the only man who could have made a peace agreement based on a two-state solution legitimate in Palestinians' eyes, Yasser Arafat, took this legitimacy with him to the grave.
President Mahmoud Abbas was never an inspiring figure for Palestinians.
With the loss of Gaza to Hamas, his political clout has been diminished even further.
In fact, Abbas does not even control the militias of his own party, Fatah, which have been even more active than Hamas in staging terrorist attacks against Israel.
The Palestinian Authority's rule over the West Bank would have collapsed long ago if it were not for the Israelis' daily incursions against Hamas and Fatah in areas under Abbas' control.
Throughout history, nationalist movements, almost invariably consisting of radical and pragmatic wings, had to split in order to reach the Promised Land.
Consensus is the negation of leadership and frequently a recipe for political paralysis.
Zionism is a case in point.
If Menachem Begin's ultra-nationalist Irgun had joined a coalition with Ben-Gurion's pragmatic Mapai in 1947, Zionists would have rejected the partition of Palestine, and Ben-Gurion would not have been allowed to declare the Jewish state in May 1948.
Of course, this lesson should not be elevated to a dogma.
In the Palestinian case, with the lack of the kind of leadership that Arafat provided, the radical wing, Hamas, cannot be discarded from the process leading to Palestinian statehood.
Moreover, unlike in the case of Israel, the radical wing in Palestine represents the democratic majority, as it emerged victorious from the elections two years ago.
As a result, the question that dominates Israeli discourse nowadays is whether or not to invade Hamas-controlled Gaza.
Locked in a self-imposed conceptual paralysis that does not allow for a non-military solution, Israel refuses to see that Hamas's rocket attacks on Israeli territory are not intended to draw Israel into an invasion.
Instead, they are an attempt to establish a new deterrent against Israel that would force it to agree to a cease-fire ( Tahdiye) .
It is self-deceiving to assume that those on the Palestinian side involved throughout the discredited Oslo process can still muster the necessary popular legitimacy to win support for a compromise with Israel that would require painful concessions on issues central to the Palestinian national ethos.
Nor is it at all clear that a major invasion of Gaza could bring end the attacks on Israel.
Hamas, with the help of Iran, has been undergoing a process of Hezbollahization.
Its units are no longer simple terrorist cells; they are highly trained and well-equipped combat units, and its rockets, like those in southern Lebanon, are launched with timers from crude underground silos.
The traumatic experience of the Lebanon war in 2006 has made Israel's leadership wary of yet another asymmetric war where a clear-cut victory can never be claimed, and where the arithmetic of blood is always bound to turn the casualties of the superior force, Israel, into a domestic crisis.
Israel must change its strategic objective in Gaza from toppling Hamas to rescuing the Annapolis process, and with it the last chance for a two-state solution.
This requires not only a cease-fire with Hamas, but also a return to a Palestinian national unity government that alone can offer the peace process the vital legitimacy that it lacks today.
Without the resurrection of the Mecca agreement, which put Hamas and the PLO in a coalition government, Hamas cannot expect to secure its control of Gaza and the PLO cannot deliver a peace settlement with Israel.
The notion, dear to the architects of the Annapolis process, that peace can be achieved only when a wedge is driven between Palestinian "moderates" and "extremists" is a misconception.
A Palestinian national unity government would not impede a settlement for the simple reason that the moderates now negotiating with Israel must in any case strive for an agreement that the extremists could not label as a treacherous sell-out.
Hence, the difference between the Palestinian positions in the current negotiations and those they may hold when a unity government is restored would only be very minor.
Bush's New Middle East
The war has pulverized Iraqi society, dissolving it into an ethno-sectarian patchwork. The "surge" will end sooner or later, and the Iraqis, crippled by violence and corruption, will still be incapable of uniting their polity, and, with their military still unable to take over from the Americans, jihadi and inter-ethnic violence is bound to erupt again.
As Iraqi Colonel Omar Ali, the Iraqi battalion commander in Mosul, the main focus of the insurgency today, recently put it, "Without the Americans, it would be impossible for us to control Iraq."
Wars, as Winston Churchill defined them, are always "a catalogue of blunders."
History's judgment of the Iraq war will therefore certainly dwell more on whether it has accomplished its strategic objectives of "reconstructing" a highly dysfunctional Middle East in America's democratic image and consolidating America's hegemonic position in the region than on its price in blood and money.
Strategically, the war was an utter failure.
A clear case of imperial overstretch, the war strained America's military, undermined the America's moral standing worldwide and its reputation in the Middle East, severely threatened its economy, and showed to both friends and foes the limits of American power.
The most serious unintended consequence of the war is the emergence of a powerful Shia challenge to the West's Sunni allies in the Middle East.
America's destruction of Iraq as a regional power handed hegemony in the Persian Gulf -- whose centrality to Western interests cannot be overstated -- to Iran's Shia Islamist regime on a silver platter.
On the rubble of Saddam Hussein's dictatorship, the Americans helped create in Iraq the first Shia-dominated Arab state, which may well become subservient to Iran's regional ambitions -- a calamity of historic dimensions for America's Sunni allies.
President Mahmoud Ahmedinejad's recent state visit to Iraq conveyed to the Americans an unequivocal message: the prospects of the United States ever reaching a modicum of stability in Iraq have become dependent on Iran-aligned forces.
America's difficulties in Iraq and beyond contributed decisively to Iran's nuclear ambitions.
The Iranians now see themselves as immune from an American attack on their nuclear installations, for America's troubles in Iraq and the growing opposition to the war in the US are a signal to them that America's strategy of pre-emptive wars has failed.
But, however radical the Iranian regime might be, it is not suicidal.
Hence, the threat of a nuclear Iran might consist less in its propensity to start a nuclear war with Israel than in its capacity to project its regional power effectively.
A nuclear Iran might even threaten America's capacity to project conventional military force in the Gulf in times of crisis.
Nor should the possibility be ruled out that Iran might be tempted to back its regional ambitions by supplying nuclear material to proxy terrorist groups.
If anything, America's debacle in Iraq has only emboldened the challengers of the status quo in the region.
That has also been the result of Bush's ill-conceived democracy crusade in the Arab world.
Bush discovered to his dismay that any exercise in Arab democracy is bound to usher in anti-Western Islamists, be it the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, Shia parties in Iraq, or Hamas in Palestine.
The US eventually had to abandon its fantasies about Western-style Arab democracy, but it ironically left the Iranians carrying the torch of democracy in the region.
After all, Iran was quick to recognize that free elections are the safest way to undermine the Middle East's pro-American regimes.
The Iraq war also meant that America ignored the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.
The chances that the Bush administration might be able to rally America's Sunni "moderate" allies in the region to help salvage an Israeli-Palestinian peace are now hostage to an Iranian-led regional axis that includes Hamas, Hezbollah, and Syria.
All are united in their rejection of a Pax Americana in the Middle East, and all have so far shown remarkable resilience in ignoring America's pre-conditions for a dialogue.
America's inability to inspire the peoples of the Middle East, all ruled by US-backed autocracies, is not exactly stunning news.
What is news is that American power might also be losing its ability to intimidate them.
Israel's Mission
And yet, at its 60th anniversary, Israel stands at a crossroads.
Indeed, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert has warned of "the end of the Jewish state" if the country remains bogged down in the occupied territories and a Palestinian state is not established.
Israel's internal challenges are no less demanding.
The relatively homogeneous society envisaged by its founders has fragmented into a tense multi-ethnic tapestry comprising secular Jews, an alienated Arab minority, a prolific ultra-orthodox community living on state allowances, religious nationalists bent on a Messianic brand of Zionism, immigrants from the former Soviet Union, marginalized Ethiopians, and Oriental Jews still struggling to join the middle class.
Moreover, Israel has failed to redress a dangerous imbalance: however creative its economy may be, the burden of military expenditure is undermining its investment in education and scientific research.
Metaphorically, Israel's national psyche oscillates between "Tel Aviv" and "Jerusalem." "Tel Aviv" embraces secularism, hedonism, and economic growth, and views the State of Israel as a legal entity, in contrast to the dangerous, faith-driven "Jerusalemite" concept of "Eretz Israel."
It has replaced Israel's early pioneering ethos with the temptations of modernity, liberalism, and "normalcy."
It aspires to be part of the "global village," not an isolated, parochial Jewish outpost.
By contrast, "Jerusalem" regards "Tel Aviv's" drive for "normalcy" as a shallow affair, one that is almost criminally indifferent to Jewish memory and the lessons of Jewish history. The Israel of "Jerusalem" is one of yearning for Jewish roots, a deep-seated fear of "the Arabs," and an unyielding distrust of "Gentiles" and their "international community."
Israel was born in war and has lived by the sword ever since.
Rarely in history has a national movement marched to its Promised Land with such a brilliant display of diplomatic savoir-faire and military skill as the Zionists did on their way to statehood.
But Israel's breathtaking victory against three Arab armies in 1967 brought it not only grandeur, but also moral and political decay.
Forty-one years later, Israel is still incapable of extricating itself from the corrupting occupation of Palestinian lands, and from the folly of settlements.
This is the paradox of Israel's existence: a sense of power combined with an ever-present apocalyptic fear of annihilation, reflected in its hostile reaction to any initiative that touches its physical security.
Of course, Jews' historical experience is not conducive to easy conciliation.
The crisis of the Jewish conscience in the traumatic transition from Holocaust to statehood has not yet been fully overcome.
Israel always, it seems, opts for a fatalistic interpretation of regional challenges, and its agonizing task today is to adopt a radical change of strategy by overcoming its leaders' traditional tendency to make decisions only on the basis of worst-case scenarios.
It has been a sadly recurrent condition of the Arab-Israeli conflict that no war lost by a humiliated Arab side has ever ushered in a peace settlement, just as no war overwhelmingly won by Israel has ever led its leaders to be magnanimous in victory.
Peace efforts began almost invariably thanks to Arab, not Israeli, moves.
Such was the case of the 1973 war, which was started by President Anwar Sadat with the aim of forcing the United States to broker an Egyptian-Israeli peace.
Likewise, the Palestinian Intifada of 1987 forced Israel to abandon the politics of inertia and engage in a process that culminated in the Oslo accords.
Zionism's unique combination of democracy and utopianism enabled the Jews to recover their birthright and gave them a key to the future.
The same tools must be used to end the conflict with the Arab world, in particular with the Palestinians.
The Jews did not survive extermination only to entrench themselves behind walls of their own making.
They survived in order to resolve what for too long has looked like an insoluble conundrum: legitimizing Jewish statehood in the eyes of those who consider themselves its victims.
Are Israel and Syria Ready for Peace?
The two major formative experiences of Syria's Ba'ath regime have been Hafez al-Assad's loss of the Golan Heights in the 1967 war with Israel, and the loss of Lebanon by his son, Bashar, who was forced to withdraw his army under irresistible American-led international pressure.
Recovering the Golan Heights and protecting Syria's vital interests in Lebanon are not only major strategic concerns for Syria's president; they are also crucial to the regime's drive for national legitimacy, and to Bashar's assertion of his own leadership. 
Peace with Israel is not Assad's priority.
Rather, it is the prerequisite without which superior goals -- rapprochement with the United States, legitimization of Syria's special status in Lebanon, and avoidance of a potentially devastating war with Israel if the Golan Heights are not recovered by peaceful means -- cannot be attained.
Indeed, the regime has hinted that it may be willing to compromise on the issue -- the delineation of the 1967 border along a tiny piece of land on the Eastern shore of the Sea of Galilee -- that wrecked the negotiations eight years ago.
An Israeli-Syrian peace is a weighty strategic necessity for Israel, too.
The complexities of the threats to Israel are such that a possible confrontation with Hamas in Gaza might trigger a flare-up with Hezbollah in Lebanon.
Such a war could be won only by the total destruction of Lebanon by Israel's air force.
In that case, Syria would likely seize the opportunity to break the deadlock over the Golan Heights through a military move that could develop into a massive war of missiles targeting Israel's vulnerable home front.
And Iran, in its drive to protect its nuclear program from an Israeli-American attack, might be very active in supporting this ominous scenario.
Admittedly, the strategic conditions in the region are far more complex today than they were eight years ago, when Israel's requirements for a deal with Syria focused mainly on security arrangements on the Golan Heights, and on Syria using its leverage in Lebanon to permit an Israeli settlement with that country.
Syria's alliance with Iran was not a major issue.
Syria's subsequent forced withdrawal from Lebanon was not good news for Israel.
In the last round of Israeli-Palestinian peace talks eight years ago, it was clear that a deal with Syria would automatically pave the way to a settlement with Lebanon, and an end to Hezbollah's threat to Israel's northern border.
Today, peace with Syria might facilitate an Israeli peace with Lebanon down the road, but that will not be an automatic outcome.
Indeed, while Hezbollah prospered under Syrian occupation, it never reached the extraordinary political power that it has today.
Nevertheless, peace with Syria could be a major building block in a wider Israeli-Arab settlement, and consequently of a more stable Middle East, though it is unrealistic to expect that Syria would automatically sever its special relationship with Iran in exchange for the Golan Heights.
These are peace talks, not a defense treaty, and Syria would not abruptly disengage from its Iranian friends.
But good relations between an Arab state at peace with Israel and Iran are not necessarily a bad thing.
Syria's stance might limit, rather than extend, the reach of Iran's strategy of regional destabilization.
As always, much will depend on America's readiness to move away from military solutions and rigid ideological imperatives and instead embrace the pragmatic culture of conflict resolution.
A US-backed Israeli-Syrian peace could transform the strategic environment, potentially drawing other Middle East spoilers into a system of regional cooperation and security.
Peace On All Fronts?
So is the Middle East at the gates of a lasting, comprehensive peace?
Not quite.
Aside from the Annapolis talks, which seem to be going nowhere because of the parties' irreconcilable differences over the core issues, all the other peace efforts are more tactical than strategic.
In none of them do the conditions yet exist for an immediate leap from war to peace, nor do the parties themselves expect that to happen.
It would require bold statesmanship to turn the cease-fire with Hamas into a prelude to political talks.
Indeed, both Israel and the United States are adamant about excluding Hamas from the Annapolis process unless and until it recognizes Israel's right to exist, while Hamas will not abandon its identity as a resistance movement merely to join negotiations that seem unlikely to satisfy the Palestinian people's minimal requirements.
For Israel, the cease-fire with Hamas reflects its reluctance to become mired in another asymmetric war like the one it fought in Lebanon two summers ago, this time in the alleys of Gaza's refugee camps.
Ehud Olmert, an especially unpopular prime minister whose days leading the government are probably numbered, lacks the legitimacy to throw the country into another bloody war, which given conditions in Gaza would be both costly and inconclusive.
Israel's leaders believe that the day of reckoning with Hamas will come only when the conditions for a major military showdown are riper.
The Syrian track -- requiring Israel's withdrawal from the strategically vital Golan Heights and the evacuation of tens of thousand of settlers -- is hampered not only by the Israeli leadership's legitimacy deficit, but also by US opposition to the talks.
For the Syrians, the major objective in concluding peace with Israel is rapprochement with the US, but they will balk at the Americans' demand that they stop flirting with terrorism as a precondition for talks.
In fact, it is doubtful that they will ever agree to this.
As Buthaina Shaaban, a Syrian minister, put it, "To demand that Syria forsake Hamas and Hezbollah is like demanding that the United States forsake Israel."
The US has been absent from Middle East peacemaking for too long.
Indeed, for the first time in the history of its special relationship with Israel, America is not speaking to Israel's enemies, be they Syria, Iran, Hamas, or Hezbollah.
As a result, Israel, embattled and facing a gathering storm of regional threats, had to find its own way to talk, without the diplomatic assistance of its big brother.
The demarche with Lebanon, to which US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice devoted most of her recent surprise visit to Beirut, has much to do with America's desperate attempt to revive its role as the main regional peace broker.
After all, it was tiny Qatar that brokered Lebanon's domestic settlement, Egypt that mediated the Gaza cease-fire, and Turkey that is facilitating the Israeli-Syrian talks.
Israel's shift in policy towards Syria, and that of French President Nicolas Sarkozy, was a powerful message to the Americans that they should not miss the Lebanese train as well.
But America's dwindling leverage cannot match the influence of the region's "axis of evil."
Lebanon is too vulnerable to pressure from Syria and Iran, neither of which wants to see their local clients relieve the Israelis of the burden of a "Lebanese front" before their own grievances are addressed.
Nor is Hezbollah keen to see the end of Israel's occupation of the Sheba Farms on the Lebanon border undermine its claim to the formidable independent military force that it has built with Iranian and Syrian help.
Tactical moves, however, can always develop into strategic shifts.
The Gaza cease-fire should be allowed to facilitate reconciliation between Fatah and Hamas, which would make the Annapolis process more legitimate and inclusive.
It was none other than the Hamas spokesman in Gaza, Salah al-Bardawil, who defined the cease-fire as "a historic opportunity for all the sides involved to live in peace, and to build a future for the next generations."
Nor are the other peace tracks -- Lebanon, Syria, and maybe also Iran -- doomed to permanent failure.
But their success, so urgently needed to save the region from the politics of Doomsday, will have to wait for a new US administration to inject into them the necessary balance of realism and idealism, military power tempered by a genuine commitment to diplomacy.
This Gordian knot needs to be cut, not untied.
The concept of interim agreements has now become utterly obsolete, if only because the parties are incapable of paying the political price inherent in an open-ended, piecemeal process.
Instead, what is called for is a sweeping solution to all the core issues.
We now stand at the end of the peace process as we have known it.
From now on, our options will be a violent and unilateral disengagement, such as the one that ushered in the current war in Gaza, and a comprehensive peace plan that will have to be annexed to the road map and validated by an international peace conference.
As the launch of the peace process at the 1991 Madrid International Peace Conference demonstrated, the prospects for peace in the Middle East always needed a concerted international push to exploit windows of opportunity.
Wars in the Middle East, especially those , such as Israel's recent war against Hezbollah, that ended inconclusively, have almost invariably created the conditions for major political breakthroughs, because they taught the warring parties the limits of power.
Trapped in a momentous struggle between the forces of peaceful change and those committed to Doomsday, the Middle East is once again calling for a major international effort at peacemaking.
The initiators of the 2002 Arab peace initiative likewise understood that a strictly bilateral approach might be inadequate, and instead called to regionalize the solution to the conflict.
Loss of mutual trust between the parties, and their total incapacity to take even the smallest step towards each other, let alone to observe their commitments without prodding by third parties, made (and still makes) an international framework for peace the only way out of the dangerous impasse.
The end of bilateralism stems also from the dysfunctional political systems of both Palestine and Israel.
Today, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas is gasping for political air under the smothering control of Hamas.
On her recent trip to Israel, Rice had to listen to four different peace plans from the prime minister, the foreign minister, the minister for strategic threats, and the defense minister.
For both Israelis and Palestinians, achieving internal peace might prove as formidable a challenge as establishing peace with each other.
Any reformed peace process is doomed if it is guided by a road map within which, on the core issues, the parties have diametrically opposed views.
But there is no need to reinvent the wheel, because the solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict is embodied in the main peace plans that are already on the table: the Clinton peace parameters, and the all-Arab peace initiative.
Fifteen years after the Madrid Conference began a formal peace process between Israelis and Palestinians, the parties are wiser as to what is inevitable if this tortuous process is to lead to a permanent settlement.
In 1991, they convened on a platform of "land for peace."
But the Israelis never believed they would have to give back all the land, while the Arabs did not think they might have to offer "all the peace."
Today, at long last, everyone knows what is meant by "land," and everyone knows what is meant by "peace."
The Extremists Unbound
Israel and the United States failed resoundingly in their attempt to dislodge Hamas from Gaza, or in forcing it to accept conditions for an end to the international boycott.
Fearing the costs of an invasion of Gaza's urban alleys, Israel handed a strategic victory to Hamas.
It accepted a truce, brokered by an Egyptian government fearful of Iran's influence in neighboring Gaza, that not only gave Hamas political legitimacy and undermined the international community's policy of not negotiating with this fundamentalist group, but that also allowed it to continue rearming.
Indeed, Hamas now poses a strategic threat to Israel's urban centers and military facilities.
Israel's war in 2006 in Lebanon against Hezbollah, supported by the US and the entire Arab "moderate" camp, was no more successful.
In fact, Hezbollah is now not only militarily stronger than ever -- Security Council Resolution 1701, which called for its disarmament, has proven to be an utter failure -- but also more politically robust than before the war.
Admirably adept at weaving together all of Lebanon's political, religious, and nationalists threads, Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nazrallah, is today the undisputed master of Lebanon.
The Syrian patron of Hezbollah, President Bashar al-Assad, another member of the "axis of evil," is also doing well, thank you.
Not only Israel and the US, but also Egypt and Saudi Arabia have hoped for the political demise of this friend of every radical regional cause -- from Hamas and Iran to the anti-Western forces in Lebanon -- that they oppose.
But Assad managed to emerge from Syria's forced withdrawal from Lebanon in 2005 to become the broker without whom a Lebanese government could not be created and a president could not be elected.
This, and the indirect negotiations with Israel that are now underway in Turkey -- which Assad knows cannot produce major results, given Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's political weakness and Bush's lame-duck status -- have helped to open for Syria the gates of Europe, where he had also once been a pariah.
Moreover, desperate to recover its relevance in Middle East politics, the US has now radically changed its attitude and agreed to a meeting between US Undersecretary of State for Near East Affairs David Welch and Riad Daoudi, Syria's chief negotiator with Israel.
America's drive to force Iran to stop its nuclear program through an ineffective sanctions regime has been no more successful than any of its other schemes to isolate the region's extremists.
Indeed, the US has now completely reversed its position of not negotiating with Iran until it stops uranium enrichment.
The participation of Under Secretary of State William Burns in the European dialogue with Iran, together with plans to station American diplomats in Teheran for the first time since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, represents a momentous shift in America's policy, and also an indication to Israel to refrain from a military strike.
Bogged down in Iraq and Afghanistan, America is in no mood to open a third front against the Islamic world.
The consequences of an Israeli attack on Iran "would be extremely stressful for us," warned Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Michael Mullen.
With the defeat of his ideologically inspired foreign policy, Bush has finally decided not to remain blind to the benefits of engaging Syria and Iran.
However isolated within the Arab family the Syrians may be, and however embattled their Iranian allies are, the two countries hold the keys to Middle East stability.
They are crucial players in Lebanon, they have a role to play in pacifying Iraq, they can influence a change of attitude of powerful and extremely destabilizing non-state actors like Hamas and Hezbollah, and their leverage on Hamas is vital for the stability of the Palestinian front.
Engaging Iran is also the only way to stave off a nuclear apocalypse in the region.
Of course, the overall cooling of political tensions reflects the collapse of another misconception of the Bush administration -- that the "axis of evil" is an irrational coalition interested only in spreading evil.
Pursuing radical goals does not necessarily mean that a country will act irrationally.
Neither Syria nor Iran -- in fact, not even North Korea -- has an interest in being the pariahs of the world community, and they fully understand the economic consequences of isolation.
Their policies are about more than spreading terror and revolution; they are about promoting negotiable interests.
They are both mindful of the limits of the politics of destabilization, and they are clearly looking forward to a more dialogue-oriented American administration willing to address their political and strategic concerns.
Who Wants Cold War II?
Russia's military is certainly not fit for a global confrontation with the West.
Not only did Russian intelligence fail to catch the coming Georgian attack on South Ossetia, but Russia's electronic warfare system and ill-equipped ground troops looked like outdated Soviet-era relics.
Then again, a war does not have to display state-of-the-art weaponry to convey a powerful political message.
After all, America's global leverage is dwindling even as its army remains the most sophisticated military machine in history.
By showing that the United States has lost its monopoly on the unilateral use of force, and by invading an American ally -- which even the Soviet Union never dared -- Russia blatantly challenged the Pax Americana that emerged from the US victory in the Cold War.
The war in Georgia could not have happened if America had not mishandled its global hegemony so disastrously.
The US entered a calamitous war in Iraq, missed more than one opportunity to engage Iran's revolutionary regime, pushed for unending expansion of NATO onto the doorstep of Russia, and haughtily ignored Russia's protests against the deployment of missile defenses in Eastern Europe.
Under the cover of the "war on terror," the US played into Russia's fear of encirclement through its military penetration into Central Asian countries such as Afghanistan, Pakistan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, and Tajikistan.
In its quest to counter what it sees as a hostile US strategy of creating American "Cubas" on its doorstep, the Kremlin is promoting alliances with Raúl Castro's Cuba and Hugo Chávez's Venezuela.
In the Middle East, Russia is doing everything to regain some of the footholds it had in the past with the aim of sidelining America as the sole global actor in the region.
Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's recent visit to Moscow is a transparent manifestation of the potential for a renewed alliance.
Russia continues to place hurdles before American proposals for sanctions on Iran, has signed with it lavish energy contracts, and is about to sell it advanced aerial systems aimed at thwarting a possible Israeli or American attack.
Likewise, the Russians have just erased much of Iraq's debt and agreed lucrative oil drilling deals.
One victim of American post-Cold War unilateralism has been the transatlantic alliance.
The US drive to expand NATO is not shared by all its allies, and Europe is in no mood to follow in the footsteps of Georgia's impulsive president and be dragged by the ex-Soviet Baltic states and Poland into a confrontation with Russia.
Europe, dependent as it is on Russian energy supplies, is not prepared for a new Cold War, and its alternative to Russian oil -- Iran -- is not palatable to the Americans.
A return to a Cold War strategy is clearly not in the West's interest.
Threats to expel Russia from the G-8 or keep it out of the World Trade Organization will only increase its sense of isolation, strengthen its authoritarianism, and push it into the role of a revolutionary anti-status quo power in the Soviet Union's old sphere of influence and beyond.
Russian minorities still waiting to be "redeemed" in Ukraine, the Baltic states, and Moldova are potential triggers for Russia's neo-imperialism. 
But, as a power burdened with too many domestic ills and a chronic sense of insecurity along its vast and dangerously depopulated borders, Russia cannot be interested in a Cold War II, either.
Its recent agreement with China on border demarcation notwithstanding, Russia can never be assured of China's ultimate intentions as a colossal power hungry for raw materials for its booming economy and living space for its massive population.
As the war in the Caucasus has shown, the global economy does not offer a foolproof guarantee against war.
But it is one thing to take a calculated risk, as the Russians did in rightly assuming that the West would not go to war over Georgia; it is another thing for Russia to jeopardize its colossal economic gains of recent years in an all-out confrontation with the West.
Indeed, the war in Georgia already has thrown Russia into the most severe financial crisis since its virtual bankruptcy in 1998; $17 billion were lost in capital flight in just one week.
The Moscow stock exchange lost 15% of its value in August, and Russia's central bank forecasts a 25% decline in foreign investment this year.
Ignored and humiliated by the US since the Cold War ended, Russia needs integration into a new global order that respects its interests as a resurgent power, not an anti-Western strategy of confrontation.
A Middle Eastern Union?
The idea is compelling.
Attending to such basic needs in a way that manages scarcities and surpluses regionally has a powerful logic.
Indeed, the parallels with the role of coal and steel in forging the European Union are clear enough that, over the past month, Joschka Fischer, Germany's former foreign minister, has called for such a union.
So, too, have former Czech president Václav Havel and a group of global luminaries who support the idea of regional integration through water.
Having convened the meeting in Spain, we are very much in favor of the pursuit of such a worthy goal.
But the European "coal and steel union" became possible only after Europe's major political conflicts were resolved.
A successful process of regional integration in the Middle East will also require a political framework that ensures the stability needed to make regional cooperation work.
All sides need to know where their borders begin and end.
And past injustices will need to be put aside, so that the cycle of revenge and the automatic reflex in favor of immediate gain do not scuttle regional solutions to problems.
Here, the experience of a previous regional exercise is worth acknowledging.
During the 1990's, the multilateral track of the Middle East Peace Process pursued regional coordination concerning economic development, the environment, refugees, arms control, and water.
It failed, because when the bilateral talks collapsed, readiness to engage in regional cooperation withered under the despair of failed politics and the bloody reality of the Second Intifada.
Despite today's chronic pessimism, the pursuit of a Middle East Water and Energy Union, coupled with adoption of the Arab Peace Initiative, would change mindsets.
Together, they would form a mutually reinforcing process: a political agreement would provide the framework in which the region's water and energy needs can be met; and meeting these basic needs in an effective and innovative way would make the Arab Peace Initiative more than a paper deal.
Moreover, the arid triangle formed by Israel, Palestine, and Jordan cannot meet its water needs unless yet another dimension is incorporated into the solution.
A World Bank report has already stated that, with 19 million people living between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean by 2020, water needs would not be met without making existing technologies of desalinization more economically viable.
Coincidentally, over the past month, there have been early signals of greater interest in a regional political approach.
The Bahraini foreign minister recently called for a regional forum that includes Israel to resolve the problems ahead; a former senior Saudi official met with Israelis in the United Kingdom to reiterate the need for a comprehensive peace agreement; and Israeli Labor Party leader Ehud Barak has said that it may be time to pursue an overall peace deal for the region, accompanied by an economic package, since separate negotiations with Syria and the Palestinians may prove fruitless.
Despite decades of effort, the process of trial and error through bilateral and conflict-management approaches has always ended in frustration.
Whatever economic projects have been launched has crumbled in the face of the persistence of the occupation.
The problems are too complex, and the dangers of radicalism too advanced, to permit success through haphazard means.
The Middle East can end its state of permanent crisis only if it builds a comprehensive foundation for peace.
The Arab Peace Initiative, combined with the long-term development of a Water and Energy Union, offers the necessary basis to meet the needs of the region's peoples and mitigate future conflict.
The Middle East must no longer be a hallmark of intractable violence.
It can be a herald of innovation on issues of common human concern -- water, energy, and politics.
Obama's Middle East
Obama's agenda is breathtaking.
It includes extrication from the Iraqi morass and lifting its burden from America's foreign policy, resolving the festering Israeli-Palestinian conflict while confronting the "hawkish" Israel lobby, using dialogue to curb Iran's nuclear ambitions and wean Syria from its radical agenda -- thereby dissolving the region's "axis of evil" (Iran-Syria-Hezbollah-Hamas) -- freeing Lebanon from Syria's grip, and pushing for an Israel-Syria peace.
And you can add to this a reorientation of America's military effort to the war in Afghanistan.
The magnitude of this agenda must be seen against the region's depressing legacy.
The entire region is going through a dangerous process of "Somaliazation," with an expanding chain of non-state agents, mostly radical Islamist groups, challenging the idea of the state almost everywhere.
This is the case in Lebanon with Hezbollah, in Palestine with Hamas, in Iraq with Moqtada al-Sadr's Mahdi Army and scores of other groups, with the Taliban and tribal warlords in Afghanistan, and with breakaway movements in Pakistan that have been emboldened by Pervez Musharaf's resignation.
The looming end of President Hosni Mubarak's long rule in Egypt might lead to the emergence of a formidable bid by the Muslim Brotherhood for power in Cairo, possibly forcing Mubarak's successor either to reach a modus vivendi or to wage a fight to the death.
Obama may soon learn that his timetable for withdrawal from Iraq is unrealistic.
A rapid American disengagement might ultimately cause the country's disintegration into fragmented political entities, one of which would likely be an Iran-controlled Islamic republic.
The resurgence of the Taliban in Afghanistan requires a more robust military response, but with the American army bogged down in Iraq and the Western allies reluctant to send additional troops, the country's dismemberment by local warlords is not a far-fetched scenario.
And, with the allies' military operations eroding President Hamid Karzai's domestic legitimacy, Obama might consider the advice of French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner, who warns that the answer in Afghanistan will have to be more political than military.
As for Iran, Obama might have to fall back on a strategy of military pressure sooner than he would like.
As the protracted dialogue conducted by the European Union's special representative, Javier Solana, on behalf of the Security Council's permanent members and Germany has proved, Iran has no intention of deviating from its drive to nuclear status.
Unless Obama reaches an uneasy understanding with Russia -- which would require revising post-Cold War strategic agreements -- the chances of imposing a tight sanctions regime on Iran are slim.
The specter of a Middle East nuclear arms race, with Iran's Sunni rivals in the region -- Saudi Arabia, Egypt and others -- redoubling their efforts to attain nuclear status, cannot be ruled out.
In the Middle East, Obama faces an almost impossible task of redressing historical and political ills.
Meanwhile, he inherits an America that is no longer an undisputed hegemony, and that, together with its allies, is immersed in the most severe economic crisis since 1929.
Struggling with a crisis that is shaking the foundations of capitalism and the American way of life, and laden with a $10 trillion national debt and a $1 trillion budget deficit, the United States is bound to opt for a realistic foreign policy, one that departs from the haughty disregard for history, tradition, and religion that characterized the Bush administration.
Obama's ascension to the US presidency represents a revolutionary landmark in America's history that should not be allowed to fall victim to inflated expectations.
His idealism needs to be tempered by the limits of American power.
The challenge of his foreign policy is not to change the Middle East -- this is the long-term task of the region's peoples -- but to redress America's damaged reputation in the Muslim world.
To achieve this objective requires resolution of the Arab-Israeli conflict, particularly the Palestinian question.
This is the real wound that infects America's entire foreign policy, particularly its standing in the Arab and Muslim world.
During his visit to the region last July, Obama vowed to address the Israeli-Palestinian conflict "starting from the minute I'm sworn into office."
He cannot lose any time in fulfilling that pledge.
Unlike the insoluble mess that he inherits in the broader Middle East, the road to a comprehensive solution of the Arab-Israeli dispute has already been paved, and no wheels would have to be reinvented.
Leadership and commitment are what is required, and Obama's "Yes, we can" campaign has already shown that he has both.
Slouching Toward Gaza
As a government, Hamas is to be judged by its capacity to provide security and decent governance to Gaza's population, but as a movement it is incapable of betraying its unyielding commitment to fight the Israeli occupier to the death.
After all, Hamas was not elected to make peace with Israel or to improve relations with the United States.
However encouraging some sporadic signs of a shift toward political realism might be, it is not on Hamas's immediate agenda to betray its very raison d'être by endorsing the US-led Annapolis peace process.
Hamas's offensive is not an attempt to draw Israel into a costly invasion that might shake its regime.
Rather, it is a move aimed at establishing a balance of threat based on sustaining a low-intensity conflict even if a new lull is agreed upon.
A now increasingly arrogant and extremely well armed Hamas expects such a lull to be agreed upon only in exchange for new concessions from both Israel and Egypt.
These include the opening of Gaza's borders, including the Egyptian-controlled Rafah crossing, the release of Hamas detainees in Egypt, the suspension of Israeli operations against Hamas activists in the West Bank, and the right to respond to any perceived Israeli violation of the ceasefire.
But Hamas's brinkmanship is a dangerous exercise, for a low-intensity conflict can easily degenerate into an all-out flare-up if its rockets cause a politically unbearable number of casualties on the Israeli side.
In fact, Israel's top leaders have already approved the army's plans for an invasion of Gaza, with the timing and the nature of the casus belli left open.
Hamas is playing with fire on the Egyptian front, too, having haughtily interrupted the Egyptian-led reconciliation process with Mahmoud Abbas's PLO and pledging to derail the Egyptian and Saudi initiative to extend Abbas's presidential term until 2010.
Hamas has made clear its intention to appoint as president the Palestinian parliament speaker -- a Hamas member now in an Israeli prison -- once Abbas's presidency officially ends on January 9.
Hamas radicalism is not devoid of a political purpose -- to bury whatever remains of the two-state solution.
The meager results of the Oslo peace process are regarded by Hamas as vindication of its consistent view that the Oslo accords were doomed to failure, and that Israel and America never intended to respect the minimal requirements of Palestinian nationalism.
But, while Hamas has never been indifferent to daily political calculations, nor is it confined to them.
A fundamentally religious movement for whom the future belongs to Islam, Hamas sees itself as being engaged in a long-term armed struggle for the liberation of all of Palestine.
Nor is the movement's brinkmanship entirely irrational, for the legacy of Israel's 2006 abortive attempt to destroy Hezbollah is that, for the first time in the country's history, the military establishment is advocating restraint and actively curbing the more hawkish measures being proposed in cabinet meetings.
Israel's reluctance to invade Gaza stems from a sober analysis of the meaning of such a move.
Indeed, Defense Minister Ehud Barak, the Labor Party leader, might be ready to pay a high political price during an electoral season by accepting even a new lull that is intermittently violated by Hamas.
The invasion of such a small and densely populated strip of land where civilians have been systematically used by Hamas as human shields is bound to expose Israel's military to accusations of war crimes.
However justified Israel's action might be, and however critical of Hamas's repressive regime the international community might be, it will not take long before the wide media coverage of civilian casualties will put Israel, not Hamas, in the dock of world opinion.
Moreover, reoccupation of Gaza would force Israel to reassume full and exclusive responsibility for the 1.5 million Palestinians now under Hamas control.
But, even if Israel is ready to pay the price of harsh international condemnation, it is not clear success in such a war really means.
Is toppling the Hamas regime a realistic option?
Ismail Haniyeh's government might collapse, but Hamas would remain a powerful indigenous Palestinian organization around which the population would certainly rally.
And, even under renewed occupation, with Israeli armored divisions are deployed throughout the strip, Kassam missiles might still be launched -- the ultimate humiliation for the occupier.
And, finally, after a mortal blow had been dealt to whatever remains of the peace process, and cemeteries in Israel and in devastated Gaza are again filled with new casualties, Israel would want to withdraw, and negotiate yet another ceasefire with…the same Hamas.
Europe's Dangerous Banalities
Europe's inability to help resolve the Arab-Israeli conflict does not stem from its positions on the core issues, which are only microscopically different from those held by the United States.
Its impotence stems, instead, from its attitude toward the Jewish state.
In essence, dialectic of attraction and rejection is embedded in our collective conscience as Jews and Europeans.
Europe, as Denis de Rougemont put it in 1946, is "la patrie de la memoire," a tormenting and tormented memory, one must admit.
The old continent suffers from two guilt complexes that have much to do with Israel: the colonial and the Jewish complex.
The Palestinian tragedy is directly affected by this European affliction.
Israel was born as a state out of the gravest crisis of the European conscience.
For Europeans, Israel's creation was to compensate for the sins committed against the Jewish people.
But the price that was supposedly paid by the Palestinians touched another neuralgic lobe in the European mind.
genocide to resolve its endemic disputes over borders and nationalism.
Its record in colonialism wrote monstrous pages in human history.
Now Europe is making Israelis feel not only that it is indifferent to their existential predicament, but that, rather than fighting for life against tremendous odds, Israel is committing European-style crimes.
take decisions only on the basis of worst-case scenarios.
Indeed, Israel's critics in Europe are indulging in a frivolous banalization when they compare the recent Gaza conflict or the battle of Jenin in 2002 -- with its 58 casualties among Palestinian combatants (Israel lost 25 soldiers) -- to Auschwitz, a death factory where 30,000 Jews were slaughtered daily.
Israel should not, however, rejoice at being so far away from Europe, because Europe's way is not far-fetched; the world cannot be allowed to operate for long outside a reasonable international system of rules and laws.
Turkey's New Mission
Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's missionary zeal to replace Egypt as the essential regional mediator, and his violent tirades against Israel's behavior in Gaza, looks to many people like an attempt to recover Turkey's Ottoman-era role as the guarantor of regional peace and security.
Its credentials for this role in the Middle East are by no means negligible.
Turkey is a true regional superpower, with one of the largest armies in the world.
At the same time, it is the only Muslim country that, while no less worried than Israel about Iran's nuclear ambitions, can maintain excellent economic and political relations with Iran, regardless of American displeasure.
Of course, Syria is Iran's ally, too, but no country in the region has the leverage with it that Turkey possesses.
And Turkey's diplomatic reach in the region is also reflected in its recent signing of a friendship treaty with Saudi Arabia, while maintaining excellent relations with Pakistan and Iraq.
Europe's persistence in snubbing Turkey's attempts to join the European Union, the rise of violent anti-Western popular sentiment in the wake of the Iraq war, and strained relations with the US -- owing in part to the forthcoming Armenian Genocide Act -- are major factors in Turkey's change of direction.
The civilizing efforts that Ataturk's revolution directed inward and in favor of disengagement from the Arab and Muslim worlds are now being revisited.
The Turkey of Erdogan's dominant Justice and Development Party (AKP) appears to be seeking a new mission civilisatrice , with the Middle East and the former Soviet republics as its alternative horizons.
The uneasy challenge for Turkey is to secure its newfound regional role without betraying Ataturk's democratic legacy.
Turkish democracy and secular values have been greatly enhanced by the country's dialogue with Europe and its American ties. Turkey can be a model for Middle Eastern countries if, while promoting its regional strategic and economic interests, it resists the authoritarian temptation and continues to show that Islam and democracy are fully compatible.
For Israel, the long overdue message is that its future in the Middle East does not lie in strategic alliances with the region's non-Arab powers, but in reconciling itself with the Arab world.
In the 1960's, David Ben-Gurion's fatalistic pessimism about the possibility of ever reaching a peace settlement with the Arab countries led him to forge an "Alliance of the Periphery" with the non-Arab countries in the outer circle of the Middle East -- Iran, Ethiopia, and Turkey (he also dreamed of having Lebanon's Maronite community as part of that alliance).
All of these countries did not have any particular dispute with Israel, and all, to varying degrees, had tense relations with their Arab neighbors.
The myth of Israel's military power, resourcefulness in economic and agricultural matters, and an exaggerated perception of its unique capacity to lobby and influence American policy combined to make the Israeli connection especially attractive to these countries.
The "Alliance of the Periphery" was a creative attempt to escape the consequences of the Arab-Israeli conflict.
It reflected the yearning of the Jewish state to unleash its creative energies in economic and social matters, as it created space for an independent, imaginative foreign policy that was not linked to, or conditioned by, the paralyzing constraints of the Arab-Israeli conflict.
But the security that this scheme was supposed to produce could never really be achieved; the centrality of the Arab-Israeli conflict could not be attenuated.
The Arabs' capacity to maintain their pressure on Israel and to keep world opinion focused on the Palestinians' plight made Israel's quest for evading the consequences of the conflict, either through periodic wars or by forging alternative regional alliances, a futile exercise.
The Islamic revolution in Iran, the changes in Ethiopia following the end of Haile Selassie's rule, the collapse of Maronite Lebanon, and Hezbollah's takeover of that country
left Turkey as the last remaining member of Israel's Alliance of the Periphery.
Turkey's powerful military establishment may want to maintain close relations with Israel, but the widely popular change in Turkey's foreign policy priorities, and the serious identity dilemmas facing the nation, send an unequivocal message that the alliance can no longer serve as an alternative to peace with the Arab world.
From now on, it can only be complementary to such a peace.
The Bigger Issue in Sudan
The CPA ended Africa's longest civil war, which had left behind over two million dead.
That agreement not only contains benchmarks that should lead to self-determination for Sudan's South; it also spells out a democratization process in Sudan itself.
After all, the oppressive nature of the regime in Khartoum is at the root of the many conflicts that have torn the country apart.
If the government in Khartoum persists in undermining the reform process and derailing the referendum on self-determination promised for the South in January 2011, a return to full-scale civil war, with calamitous consequences for the peoples of Sudan and the entire region, is a real possibility.
The commitment of Sudan's government to the CPA has always been equivocal.
Indeed, since the civil war's end in 2005, the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) in the South has frequently had to confront militias that operate as government proxies.
Moreover, Sudanese security forces continue to arm Arab tribes straddling the North-South border with the aim of destabilizing the mostly Christian South.
The arrest warrant for al-Bashir should not be allowed to spur further attempts by his government to sabotage the CPA and the fragile process leading to the 2011 referendum.
Nor should the international neglect that has for too long allowed the Darfur genocide to go unpunished recur when it comes to sustaining the quest for peace in Sudan.
The South's drive for independence has gained momentum because of the North's failure to make unity attractive through reform and elections, as stipulated by the CPA.
A second factor pushing secession forward is the SPLA's lack of commitment to the New Sudan ideology of its founder, John Garang, who had negotiated the CPA and died in a plane crash in 2005.
Garang fought for a united, secular, and democratic Sudan, a lofty dream that the Islamist regime in Khartoum admittedly has had no intention of implementing.
Self-determination for the South has thus become the only practical way out of the country's dilemma, and one fully consistent with the 2005 peace agreement.
Because the North possesses the capacity, but not the political will, to implement the CPA, and the South has the will but not the capacity, continued disengagement by the international community might doom the prospects for peace.
The Government of Southern Sudan suffers from serious financial constraints, owing to unrealistic assumptions about its oil revenues.
As a result, its ability to maintain services -- and the military capacity to respond to any maneuver by the Khartoum government aimed against the peace agreement -- is seriously compromised.
Only the United States appears to be committed to creating the conditions needed to implement the CPA.
President George W. Bush, who twice received Southern Sudanese president Salva Kiir at the White House, approved a program in 2006 to transform the SPLA into a professional army.
More recently, leading American congressmen have been impressing on President Barack Obama the need for a muscular effort to implement the CPA.
Recommendations presented recently to the Senate's Foreign Relations Committee, suggested that security guarantees for Southern Sudan be given in order to deter a renewal of the civil war.
Financial assistance is of course vital, but the political commitment of the international community is just as important.
For example, although the United Nations Mission in Sudan is supposed to monitor implementation of the CPA, Darfur has practically monopolized its attention.
Moreover, whatever monitoring is taking place is rarely followed by action.
The secession of a Southern Sudanese Christian state from a Muslim country, a major member of the Arab League, would have far-reaching strategic implications.
China, a close ally of the government in Khartoum, is now carefully weighing its oil interests and its strategic concerns in the South.
A high-powered Russian delegation recently arrived in Juba, the South Sudanese capital, with the proclaimed aim of "playing a more active role on the African continent."
And Japan, a major consumer of Middle East oil, has recently invited President Kiir to Tokyo.
Sadly missing in this diplomatic action is the European Union.
International law and the indictment of war criminals are important for a civilized world order, but they are no substitute for active financial and political engagement to support an internationally legitimate, and urgently needed, peace accord such as the CPA in Sudan.
Obama's Hardest Choices Lie Ahead
It is perhaps especially in Obama's domestic policy -- the shift to a more social-democratic tax system and universal health care -- that one can best see the new president's ideological drive.
But emphasizing the reduction of social inequalities does not sit easily with America's profoundly individualistic ethos, and the attempt to "Europeanize" the nature of the social contract between the state and its citizens might yet crash against the constitutive principles of the American system.
When it comes to salvaging America's collapsing financial system, Obama has been far more interventionist than any European government.
For once, the faltering Czech presidency of the EU reflected a European consensus when it defined Obama's astronomic financial stimulus as a "road to hell."
The unprecedented explosion of America's fiscal deficit raises the risk of high inflation in the future -- exactly the kind of scenario that Europeans want to prevent at all cost.
Obama's foreign policy agenda has been no less audacious than his domestic undertakings.
After eight years of American unilateralism that left behind a broken transatlantic alliance, resuscitated the specter of a cold war with Russia, and saw the Middle East decline into a doomsday politics, Obama's injection of new thinking to endemic problems is extremely welcome.
The organizing principle in the new president's foreign policy is one of not having principled, ideological guidelines.
Essentially, his approach to international issues is pragmatic, and, in departing from his predecessor's penchant for machtpolitik , Obama has pledged always to exhaust diplomacy first.
But Obama might soon realize that most of his predecessors started as believers in international cooperation, until events forced them to fall back on a strategy of confrontation.
Not even George W. Bush seemed to be committed to any particular doctrine in foreign affairs before the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, drove him to unleash his ill-conceived "global war on terror."
The real test of Obama's strategy of dialogue and cooperation will come only when it fails, and tough choices will have to be made.
Repairing old alliances is vital not only for the exercise of American power, but also for Europe's empowerment as a global player.
Yet America's European allies administered Obama's first setback.
They applauded him everywhere on his recent trip to Europe, but sent him home almost empty-handed, resisting the idea of a coordinated fiscal stimulus and, after years of preaching multilateralism, turning down his call for more European troops for Afghanistan.
For many in Europe, it was easier to live against Bush than to make sacrifices with Obama.
Obama also pushed the "reset button" with Russia, and suggested that he might freeze Bush's plan to deploy a missile defense system in the Czech Republic and Poland.
The expectation was that Russia would join the United States in putting pressure on Iran to abandon its nuclear ambitions.
But this has not yet happened.
Nor was North Korea impressed by Obama's warnings that America might shoot down its rocket if they went ahead with their launch in defiance of the United Nations.
Shielded behind a protective China, Kim Jong-il launched his rocket anyway, and the US refrained from action.
Iran is another front where Obama might be forced to recognize the limits of his conciliatory approach.
He has waived America's long-standing demand that Iran stop uranium enrichment as a precondition for negotiations, and he has sworn off any idea of regime change.
But the Iranians are the subtlest negotiators to be found anywhere, and will make certain that their nuclear program outpaces the negotiations.
If that happens, then what?
Nor is it clear what Obama really means by saying that he recognizes Iran's "rightful place in the community of nations."
If this means a special status at the expense of other Middle East powers such as Egypt or the Gulf states, Obama might run into strong opposition from America's traditional allies in the region.
It is right and refreshing that Obama has made clear that America's aspiration is to lead, not dominate.
But even an exercise in modesty and realism requires strong alliances, with partners ready for sacrifices.
Nor would old enemies and competitors like Russia and China readily abandon the benefits of spoiling American plans.
It is when this becomes crystal clear, and also when some worn-out foreign-policy paradigms, such as the fetish of a two-state solution for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict fail once again, that real choices will have to be made.
A Farewell to (Glorious) War
Donald Rumsfeld's dogma of military "transformation" -- the technological upgrading of an army's capacity to enable decisive victory with fewer troops -- failed resoundingly in Iraq.
Nor could Israel, with its overwhelming technological advantage, defeat Hezbollah in Lebanon.
More rockets and missiles fell on northern Israel in 33 days than hit Britain during all of World War II.
So the Israelis now must reckon with an entirely new phenomenon: an asymmetric entity, Hezbollah, with nation-state firepower.
So the fierce debate over whether to increase the size of American ground forces in Iraq is beside the point.
Neither the Soviet experience in Afghanistan in the 1980's nor NATO's today vindicates the claim that troop numbers are what matter most on the modern battlefield.
When geo-strategic military front lines are non-existent, as in Kosovo, Afghanistan, and Iraq, mass no longer equals victory.
The great military thinker Carl von Clausewitz's notion of "decisive battles" as the "center of gravity" of war is simply irrelevant to conflicts that have no visible "center of gravity."
Indeed, while wars from the time of Hannibal's defeat of the Romans in 216 B.C. to the Gulf War of 1991 had this center of gravity, with a massive concentration of force capable of bringing an enemy to its knees, such industrial inter-state wars have now become an historical anachronism.
Most states nowadays lie within borders that are widely accepted as legitimate, and they increasingly abide by international norms of behavior in times of war.
In fact, the obligation of states to abide by humanitarian rules of conduct while their enemies are free to barbarize warfare is what makes asymmetric wars especially insoluble.
Moreover, in an era of global media and international war crimes courts, the criteria for states' use of military force have become more complex than ever.
Inter-state combat may still occur where strategic front lines can be found, such as Israel's border with Syria, India's border with Pakistan, and the border dividing the two Koreas.
In such cases, war, as the Egyptians showed in 1973, might still serve as an avenue to resolving a conflict.
The Syrians might be tempted to launch an offensive against Israel with the objective of breaking the deadlock over the future of the Golan Heights.
However, in the case of Kashmir, the asymmetric conflict currently fought by proxies and terrorist groups might not degenerate into all-out war precisely because India and Pakistan have mutual nuclear deterrence.
This changing nature of the battlefield essentially means that war as a conclusive event in an international conflict has become obsolete.
Thus, for example, the conventional war in Kosovo lasted for two months, only to usher in a six-year asymmetric conflict.
Likewise, America's three-week "shock and awe" campaign in Iraq in 2003 ended in "victory," but opened the gates of hell for occupiers and ordinary Iraqis alike.
And six months after the merciless pounding of southern Lebanon, Hezbollah is as strong as it was before.
Nor does the return of the Taliban in Afghanistan six years after their overthrow now seen too far-fetched.
It is during the war after the war that the occupier's inferiority is revealed, with constant reinforcements increasing the number of targets for the insurgents far more quickly than the occupier can adapt to the changing battlefield.
The insurgents in Iraq, as the British admit, were able in just three years to cope with their enemies' technological superiority in a way that the IRA in Northern Ireland was unable to do in 30 years.
The Iraq war and Israel's wars with Hamas and Hezbollah show the limits of what military power can achieve, as well as vindicate diplomacy and conflict resolution.
When it comes to tackling complex political and cultural conflicts, forging international and regional alliances around a legitimate objective is more important than sheer military capacity.
That said, it would be dangerously naïve to believe that the exercise of power and the capacity to intimidate are unnecessary.
But the objectives of the use of force need to be linked to the recognition that in today's asymmetric conflicts, victory is no longer achieved on the battlefield.
Only better-informed foreign policies that can address the genuine anxieties of civilizations in crisis will yield more sustainable results.
The Obama Doctrine and Africa
Instead, Obama's administration is guided by a relativist political realism that assumes respect for cultural and religious distinctions.
His secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, underscored this tendency during her first visit to China, where her unmistakeable message was that order and stability take priority over liberty and human rights.
But what about Africa, the forgotten continent that has been conspicuously absent from Obama's hectic agenda?
There, both the resilience of the local political culture and strategic imperatives are converging to define the limits of the West's capacity to impose its values.
A fortnight before Obama's Cairo speech, a delegation of the United Nations Security Council visited four African countries to express concern about the resurgence of unconstitutional change on the continent.
Africa does indeed present a gloomy picture, with countries virtually crumbling to dust as a result of autocracy and stagnation.
But the emerging Obama doctrine suggests that "elections alone do not make true democracy," and that, as has been the case in the Arab world, any abrupt move to democracy is bound to produce chaos.
Moreover, in Africa post-authoritarian rulers are not necessarily respectful of human rights and decent governance.
The West's attitude toward democracy in the Third World has always been erratic.
It applauded the military takeover in Algeria in the early 1990's aimed at curtailing the democratic emergence of an Islamist regime, and is happy to conduct business with authoritarian regimes throughout the Arab world.
Yet, public infatuation with the external trappings of democracy is usually the norm.   
Take Guinea Conakry.
After years of turmoil, lower-ranking officers headed by Captain Moussa Dadis Camara took power in December 2008 in what was a widely supported and peaceful takeover.
Both the European Union and the United States immediately reacted by threatening the ruling junta with a total cut-off of aid unless constitutional rule and elections were restored.
Though President Camara eventually succumbed to pressure and declared elections for the coming fall, he has a valid point in insisting that he first must secure stability so that elections do not become a mere prelude to civil strife.
The case of neighbouring Guinea-Bissau, where a blood-bath has just taken place ahead of general elections, should serve as a warning.
Why should the West insist on elections in a country that since 1984 was ruled by a Western-backed dictator, Lansana Conté, who himself came to power in a military coup?
He maintained a constitution, and held elections, but this did not make him a democratic ruler, nor was he able to extricate his country from appalling backwardness despite its tremendous potential for economic development.
The problem in Africa is one of effective government, not of elections and high-minded constitutions.
Rulers should be encouraged instead to engage in bottom-up democracy building, create an honest police force and judicial system, and allow civic organizations to flourish.
Training police forces to secure law and order without resorting to bloodshed is no less important than elections.
Elections and constitutions in Africa -- Zimbabwe and Gabon's dictatorship have both -- have never been a safeguard against tyranny and human rights violations.
Camara's test -- indeed, the test for most African rulers -- consists in protecting civilians and their property, in establishing law and order without oppressive measures, and in fighting corruption.
Highly responsive to international pressure, he was recently praised by Human Rights Watch for his "very important effort" in recognizing the destructive role of corruption and drug trafficking, and for launching an official crackdown on both.
Order and stability, even in the absence of constitutional rights, is what makes countries like Libya and Tunisia legitimate in the eyes of the international community.
To recover the confidence of the international business community and the world's mining giants, who were enraged in recent years by forced renegotiations of existing deals by governments in Congo, Mongolia and Guinea, Camara was also wise to retreat from his threat to renegotiate existing mining concessions.
The West is right to insist on norms of decent government, but it risks losing its capacity to influence events in Africa when it automatically links aid to elections.
For as it does, China is using its colossal financial firepower to expand its strategic position on the continent, without linking aid and investment to pesky demands for good governance.
China's drive to retain a significant say in the pricing of iron and bauxite, of which Guinea is the world's major producer, means that it can always receive a warm welcome from officials tired of being lectured to by Westerners.
It is not good news for Western human rights champions if China ends up training policemen in countries like Guinea.
Not much imagination is required to discern what norms the Chinese might inculcate into the 1,000 Central Asian policemen and judicial officials they are currently training.
As Obama understands, such authoritarian aid is a serious challenge to the West's geo-strategic interests, including the fight against drug traffic (Guinea has become a transit point on the route from South America to Europe).
It is also undermining the opportunity to lay the basis for true democratic reform throughout the continent.
Owning Up to Israel's Bomb
US Assistant Secretary of State Rose Gottemoeller's recent call for Israel to join the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), which would require it to declare and relinquish its nuclear arsenal, has incited fears that America's diplomatic umbrella for Israel's nuclear status is ending.
From now on, it appeared to Israelis, the US will treat all states the same when it comes to nuclear weapons.
Israel is especially concerned that Obama might be willing to address Iran's nuclear ambition by equating it with Israel's nuclear status.
The intellectual foundations of the new American attitude were laid down in a famous article by Henry Kissinger, Sam Nunn, George Schultz, and William Perry entitled "Toward a Nuclear-Free World."
In calling upon the world's nuclear powers to preach by example and dramatically reduce their nuclear arsenals, the article was also a call for equality among nations in the nuclear domain.
Bruce Riedel, who until recently headed the Obama administration's strategy review  for Afghanistan and Pakistan, and who is by no means hostile to America's unique relations with Israel, has been explicit about this.
"If you are really serious about a deal with Iran, Israel has to come out of the closet.
What is remarkable is that it has lasted so long."
But it was a recent statement to Congress by Secretary of Defense Robert Gates that was especially shocking to Israelis.
He expressed understanding for Iran's desire to acquire nuclear weapons because, as he said, the Iranians are surrounded by nuclear powers such as Pakistan, India, Russia, and Israel.
Israel is bound to fight against this emerging new American doctrine that equates it with Iran, or even with India and Pakistan for that matter.
Political contexts matter, the Israelis will argue.
Not only has Iran developed its nuclear capabilities while a party to the NPT, the Israelis will say, but it also has put Israel's destruction high on its agenda.
Israel's nuclear deterrence is its ultimate defense against an existential threat.
Across-the-board nuclear equality can, in the end, only boost to Iran's nuclear claims.
Israel expects the Obama administration not only to appreciate the unique context of its ambiguous nuclear status, but also to recognize that it cannot be forthcoming in assuring its neighbors or the rest of the world regarding its nuclear program unless the Middle East political environment changes in a radically positive way.
Here, a change in Iran's pattern of behavior toward Israel is an absolute prerequisite.
The potential for export of nuclear material and know-how by countries such as Pakistan -- and perhaps one day Iran -- is also a matter of concern for Israel.
Indeed, Israel insists that it is, after all, Iran, not Israel's supposed nuclear capabilities, that triggered the current Middle East nuclear arms race.
But, as with the issue of the West Bank settlements, the Obama administration seems to be moving definitively away from an automatic endorsement of Israel's understandings with previous US administrations.
A revision of US policy towards Israel's nuclear status can by no means be ruled out.
Gottemoeller's declaration, as well as Gates' explicit recognition of Israel's nuclear status should be interpreted within the context of the Obama administration's broader disarmament agenda.
Israel's policy of nuclear ambiguity has remained practically unchallenged for almost 50 years, not least within Israel itself, where the issue has been a sacred taboo.
But the changing international environment, the threat of uncontrolled nuclear proliferation in the Middle East, and the new policies being worked out in the US might all be good reasons for Israel to consider revising its nuclear doctrine.
After all, the current strategy has not really worked either as a deterrent against conventional attacks (which persisted throughout the years that Israel supposedly developed its nuclear arsenal) or as a warning to rivals (such as Iran) against developing a nuclear weapon.
Israel's official policy is that of a Middle East Free of Weapons of Mass Destruction.
The Return of 1948
Oddly, it was Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu who, by requesting that the Palestinians recognize Israel as a Jewish state, reopened the 1948 file.
That demand brought the quest for peace back to its fundamentals, where the question of the refugees is bound to play a central role.
Netanyahu's intention was essentially to force the Palestinians into admitting that the right of return of refugees applies only to the Palestinian state, not Israel.
But the true significance of his demand lies in that it's being pronounced at a time when Prime Minister Salam Fayaad's policies are posing a genuine challenge to the Palestinian national movement to choose between an ethos of vindication and one of state building.
Under Fayaad, the Palestinian Authority seems to be superseding the Palestinian national movement's diaspora-based emphasis in favor of state-building within the territorial confines of the occupied territories.
It is as if the voice of the diaspora were being silenced in Palestine.
Conspicuously, the recently elected PLO Executive Committee -- which in the past consisted exclusively of representatives of the Palestinian Diaspora -- now has only one member from the diaspora, a delegate from Lebanon.
This could mark a sea change in the evolution of Palestinian nationalism.
In Zionism, the Jewish community in Palestine was the focus of decision making, with the Jewish Diaspora a strategic back-up.
But the situation was reversed in the case of the Palestinians: the ethos of the diaspora, with the plight of the refugees at its center, has been the beating heart of the Palestinian cause and the focus of decision making for the national movement.
As a result, the Palestinian community in the occupied territories was always subservient to the primacy of the Palestinian Diaspora.
When it sought to assume a leading role -- during the first Intifada in 1987, for example, its effort was suppressed by the diaspora-based PLO.
Fayaadism, by contrast, seeks the "Zionization" of the Palestinian national movement.
It imbues the Palestinian cause with a positive ethos of nation- and state-building by superseding Palestinian nationalism's diaspora-centered preoccupations -- and thereby transcending the paralyzing obsession with a never-fulfilled vindication of rights and justice.
In the peace process as it has been conducted up to now, the Israelis always wanted to concentrate on the issues of 1967 -- that is, land and security.
The Palestinians, however, always wanted to return to the issues of 1948: refugees, dispersion, and what Akram Hanya, a close Arafat confidant, defined as the need "to make the Israelis face the tribunal of history."
It looks as if now the roles have been inversed.
Precisely when Israel managed to domesticate the Palestinian national movement by forcing it to abandon its revolutionary path in favor of state-building and economic development -- a reorientation undertaken by Zionism as well -- the Israelis decided to draw the Palestinians back to the fundamentals of the conflict.
Indeed, despite of the rise of Fayaadism, the Palestinian national movement will be careful not to betray its real sources of legitimacy: the ethos of dispossession and the refugee.
The decisions taken at the last Fatah Convention were explicit in calling for the refugees to "return to their homes and cities."
The Palestinians are attempting to hold the stick at both ends, claiming before the world their endorsement of the two-state solution while calling for the right of return at the same time.
Any sober Palestinian leadership must know by now that the rhetorical promise of a return to an abandoned house and to the olive tree is an irresponsible mirage that fundamentally contradicts the rationale for a separate Palestinian state.
Peace is frequently not about justice but about stability.
The Palestinians must align their national conversation with what is realizable, while Israel must resolve its own contradictions and address the refugee problem in a way that secures the legitimacy and durability of a future peace agreement with the Palestinians.
Because Israel will have to implement practical measures of resettlement and compensation that will not be based on an automatic right of physical return, a symbol of genuine moral compensation is also called for.
Instead of suppressing the memory of the refugees, Israel needs to recognize that in 1948 the land was bisected by the sword, and that the Jewish state came into being partly because of the massive uprooting and dispossession of Palestinian communities.
Israel should develop enough self-confidence in its solidity as a nation to integrate into its schools' curriculum the tragedy of the Palestinian Naqbah.
The resolution of conflicts of this nature requires the recovery of historical memory and a proper hearing of the two parties' historical narratives, perhaps through the creation of Truth and Reconciliation Committees.
Israel's consolation would be that the Palestinians, too, will have to come to terms with their share of responsibility for the calamities that have befallen them.
Only an acceptable deal on the refugees can definitely close the 1948 file -- and only then can the conflict in Palestine end.
Regime Change in the Arab World
The paradox is that America might be winning the war for Arab democracy, even if by default, but cannot reap the benefits, simply because the emerging pattern of Islamic pluralistic politics does not coincide with the West's brand of secular liberal democracy.
The shift of the Arab world's mainstream fundamentalist movements to democratic politics is tantamount to a repudiation of the jihadist project and of al-Qaeda's apocalyptic strategies.
The failure of jihadism is paving the way for a potentially promising restructuring of Islamic politics, but the West either doesn't recognize the changes or is hostile to them.
The rise of Islamists throughout the region as the sole power capable of exploiting the opportunities of free elections -- Hamas' victory in Palestine and the Muslim Brotherhood's spectacular gains in the 2005 Egyptian elections are but the most noteworthy -- the ascendancy to regional hegemony of Shiite Iran, and the sense among Arab rulers that the embattled Bush administration is running out of steam have all combined to stall the promising drive to political reform in the region.
The US retreated from its democratic designs once it realized that Arab democracy is not being identified with the liberal secular opposition, a political force that practically does not exist in the Arab world, but with Islamic radicals that are seek to repudiate America's policies and the cause of reconciliation with Israel.
That this should be so has of course much to do with America's traditional policy of sustaining the Arab world's pro-Western dictators.
But the notion that the genii of democratization can now be squeezed back into the bottle is a self-serving fantasy.
The move of mainstream Islamists, like the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, the Islamic Action Front in Jordan, Hamas in Palestine, the Renaissance Party in Tunisia, or the Party of Justice and Development in Morocco, away from jihadism to political participation started well before America's democracy promotion campaign, and is not an attempt to please the West.
It is a genuine response to the needs and demands of their supporters.
Extinguishing Arab democracy, as President Mubarak of Egypt is now trying to do through his recent ban on political parties that are based on religion, will bring neither stability nor peace to the Middle East.
It will only exacerbate the rage of the masses at the West's hypocrisy, now expressed in a form of democratic charlatanry.
The stability of those Arab regimes that are not sustained by a democratic consensus is bound to be fragile and misleading.
Just as Islamic democracy is the natural reaction to Arab secular autocracy and to the West's collaboration with it, so will the destruction of political Islam usher in even more extreme options with movements like Hamas going back to social work and terror, and with al-Qaeda making inroads into Islamic societies.
Both the West and the Arab rulers need to realize that the tense equation between the incumbent regimes and political Islam is not necessarily a zero-sum game.
This has been learned the hard way by Algerian President Bouteflika who, through his Charter for Peace and National Reconciliation of February 2006, brought an end to a long and bloody civil war, the origins of which lay in the violent cancellation by the military of the Islamist Front's (FIS) electoral victory in 1991.
It is in this context that the historic compromise between the religious (Hamas) and the secular (Fatah) to form a national unity government for Palestine might have established a new paradigm for the future of regime change in the Arab world.
The concept of national unity governments might, indeed, be the formula that makes it possible to hold together the political families in the Arab world.
King Muhammad VI of Morocco has already indicated that the Crown would consider a "historic compromise" with the Islamists should they, as predicted, win the elections in June 2007.
Such compromises may be the only way to stem the slide to civil war, and possibly also co-opt the Islamists into a settlement with Israel and a rapprochement to the West.
Engaging political Islam will need to be the central part of any successful strategy for the Middle East.
Instead of sticking to doomsday prophecies or to categorical perspectives that prevent an understanding of the complex fabric of Islamic movements, the West needs to keep the pressure on the incumbent regimes to stop circumventing political reform.
As Algeria in the 1990's showed, exclusion of the Islamists is a recipe for disaster, while inclusion can breed moderation.
The practical necessities of politics are bound to dilute ideological purity.
The Mecca agreement that brought forth the unity government in Palestine will inevitably temper Hamas' radicalism, just as the regime's avoidance in Jordan of an "Egyptian solution" to the Islamist challenge allowed the Islamic Action Front to contain within the movement many who would have been otherwise drawn into the jihadist orbit.
The challenge is not how to destroy Islamic movements, but how to turn them away from revolutionary to reformist politics by granting them legitimate political space.
America's Suicidal Statecraft
Even so, America remains by far the world's most powerful country; its decline has more to do with its incompetent use of power than with the emergence of competitors.
It is American leaders' "suicidal statecraft," to use Arnold Toynbee's pithy phrase for what he considered the ultimate cause of imperial collapse, that is to blame for America's plight.
Consider the Middle East.
Nothing reveals the decline of the United States in the region better than the contrast between America's sober use of power in the first Gulf War in 1991 and the hubris and deceit of today's Iraq war.
In 1991, America forged the most formidable international coalition since World War II, and led it in a fully legitimate war aimed at restoring regional balance after Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait.
In 2003, America went to war without its trans-Atlantic allies after manipulating false assertions.
In doing so, the US embarked on a preposterous grand strategy that aimed no less at simultaneously dismantling Iraq's tyrannical regime, restructuring the entire Middle East, destroying al-Qaeda, and helping democracy to take root throughout the Arab world.
The result has been utter failure: military defeat and a severe degradation of America's moral standing.
Rather than undermining radical Islam, the US has legitimized it, in Iraq and beyond.
Indeed, what will now shape the future of the region is not democracy, but the violent divide between Shiites and Sunnis that the Iraq war precipitated.
It is this Muslim civil war that is allowing al-Qaeda to gain a larger pool of recruits.
With Iraq probably becoming the first Arab country to be ruled by Shiites, and hence integrated into an expanding Shiite Iranian empire, America's Sunni allies in the region now view the US as unreliable.
Indeed, the US is seen as practically complicit in inciting a monumental reversal of Islam's fortunes, the Shia revival.
Nor is the gospel of democracy especially dear to America's Arab allies, for the call to democratize has only emboldened the Islamists to challenge the incumbent elites for power.
Admittedly, violent Islamic fundamentalism has deeper roots in the fading promise of Arab nationalism.
But America's misbegotten democratic message has ended up alienating both its conservative regional allies, as it gave a new lease on life to political Islam, which can use the ballot box as a route to power, and the Islamists, whose electoral gains are then rejected by the US.
America's biggest strategic blunder in the Middle East arguably concerns the emergence of Iranian power.
By destroying Iraq as a counterbalancing regional force, the US dealt a major blow to its traditional Gulf allies, for whom Iraq served as a barrier against Iran's ambitions.
America offered Iran on a silver platter strategic assets that Khomeini's revolution failed to acquire either in eight years of war against Saddam or in its abortive attempts to export the Islamic revolution throughout the region.
Likewise, Iran's nuclear program gained momentum thanks to its sense of impunity following the colossal failure in Iraq of America's concept of "preventive war."
The calamitous US military experience in Iraq has left it strategically diminished.
Iraq has now become God's playground, and America can hope to achieve a modicum of stability there only with the help of other regional powers.
Nevertheless, the US will remain the most influential external actor in the Middle East, for its failure is one of leadership, not of actual power.
Humbled by military defeat, America can recover its regional relevance only by avoiding the sin of hubris, and learning to lead without attempting to dominate.
This requires engaging revolutionary forces like Iran and Syria; respecting, rather than ostracizing, those Islamist movements that have opted out from jihadism in favor of political participation; and leading an international alliance for an Arab-Israeli peace based on the Arab League initiative.
Indeed, the paradox of America's pernicious policies in Iraq is that they have created favorable conditions for an Arab-Israeli peace, as the emergence of Iran and the threat of a fundamentalist tsunami have focused Arab minds on the urgency of a settlement with Israel.
The Palestinian issue is not the source of all the Middle East's ills, but its resolution would dramatically improve America's standing among Arabs.
More importantly, it would deny Iran the ability to link popular Islamic and Arab causes with its own hegemonic ambitions.
Sharm el-Sheikh Redux
In the spring of 1996, the so-called "moderates" -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Jordan's King Hussein, Yasser Arafat, and even some representatives of the Gulf dynasties -- convened in Sharm el-Shekh with President Bill Clinton and United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan in a desperate bid to block radical Islam's emergence.
They were also expected to give an electoral boost to Prime Minister Shimon Peres of Israel who, severely undermined by Hamas's devastating campaign of suicide terrorism, was on the verge of electoral defeat at the hands of Benjamin Netanyahu.
But Islamic fundamentalism remained unimpressed.
Both its jihadist and political identity have, indeed, only gained momentum ever since.
In October 2000, Sharm el-Sheikh was the scene of another summit, with most of the same actors.
This time, the call went out for an end to the Palestinian Intifada and for Israelis and Palestinians to reach a final peace agreement.
Both objectives were endorsed by all the participants; neither was implemented.
As one of the players at that summit, I understand the reason for the gap between what was agreed by the "moderates" and the harsh realities that have driven the "extremists" forward.
The only way Arafat could stop the Intifada and stem the advance of Hamas was through an especially generous peace deal from Israel.
But such a deal became impossible precisely because the Intifada had raised Palestinian expectations to such heights that it became impossible for Israel to meet them.
Notwithstanding Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's commendable gestures at Sharm el-Sheikh in 2007, the summit's achievements are bound to be short-lived.
It is unrealistic to believe that transferring to the Palestinians tax revenues that are owed to them, removing a limited number of checkpoints in the occupied West Bank, and even releasing 250 Fatah prisoners "with no blood on their hands" will calm the Palestinian volcano, and thus enhance Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas's leadership and Fatah's edge over Hamas.
Indeed, all indications are that Hamas might soon boost its popularity by exchanging Israeli corporal Gilad Shalit for even more prisoners, including some "with blood on their hands."
This alliance of Middle East moderates comes with a price that neither Israel nor the Bush administration seems ready to pay.
The Israeli-American strategy of driving a wedge between Gaza and the West Bank while shunning negotiations on a peace settlement that could give Abbas the ultimate tool to undermine Hamas is a policy at war with itself.
Moreover, no matter how critical the moderate Arabs may be of the Hamas coup in Gaza, the Arab leaders cannot afford the domestic fallout of shunning Hamas.
Indeed, Mubarak has already called for a resumption of inter-Palestinian dialogue, which might lead to yet another attempt at a national unity government, the same kind of government with which both Israel and the US refused to do business.
Abbas is being asked to play for high stakes -- defeating Hamas and with it the cause of Islamic fundamentalism in the region -- with inadequate resources.
And, by mortgaging his entire Middle East policy to the concept of an "ideological confrontation" against the forces of evil, Bush is putting his entire strategy on the weary shoulders of a defeated Palestinian president without really providing him with the necessary tools.
Worse still, by ladling money and arms to Abbas without offering him a political horizon that would deepen his support among ordinary Palestinians, while at the same time imprisoning all Hamas leaders in the West Bank, Israel and the United States are condemning Abbas to seeming a collaborator in the eyes of his people.
Of course the Arabs are not free of blame either.
No Israeli government will risk making a far-reaching peace offer to a Palestinian Authority whose rule is characterized by abdication and anarchy.
Hamas's emergence as a formidable military force also reflects the Egyptians' inept performance in preventing the smuggling of weapons into Gaza.
Taming Hamas is in Egypt's interest, but it refuses to pay the price of a direct confrontation because that might lead Egyptian forces to be perceived as Israel's protectors.
Indeed, Mubarak's strategic vision is desperately narrow.
His role as a broker of sorts is mostly aimed at endearing himself to the US, where Congress is highly critical of his human rights record.
On his home front, he needs to cultivate, at the lowest possible price, an image as a champion of the Palestinian cause.
The latest Sharm el-Sheikh summit is also a message to the Saudis: Cairo, not Mecca, is the center of Middle East politics.
Calling for Israeli concessions is perfectly legitimate, even necessary.
But the credibility of such demands is undermined by the Arabs' inability to alleviate Palestinian misery and, no less importantly, by their failure to help the Palestinians face the hard choices they will need to make if an orderly Palestinian state is ever to emerge.
Islam as a Tool of Modernization
In the early 1970's, when it was still an overwhelmingly agrarian country and Islamization was just gaining momentum, Malaysia embarked on its so-called "New Economic Policy" (NEP), designed to help the majority Malays gain a bigger share of the country's wealth.
After three decades of spectacular economic growth, many Malays have become prosperous and content not only through secular capitalism, but through the country's renewed sense of Islamic identity, one which -- for the most part -- embraced modernization.
(Of course, paradoxes appear every now and then, such as when globalization is advocated alongside demands for stronger censorship.)
Islamic-minded politicians such as Anwar Ibrahim gained prominence when Islamization took off in the 1970's.
But the Islam they promoted was not backward looking; instead, it sought to shape a modernizing economic policy that took note of Muslim sensibilities.
Faced with the grassroots popularity of this movement, by 1982 the government of then Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed decided to co-opt Anwar Ibrahim into his United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), the dominant party within the country's ruling coalition.
The strategy worked well, and helped defuse Islamic opposition to the wrenching changes that accompanied the country's rapid economic modernization.
During the 1990's, however, Anwar increased his influence within the party, unsettling many of the old guard.
Matters came to a head after the 1997 financial crisis, when Anwar, the deputy prime minister, adopted an even more economically liberal approach than Mahathir.
Partly in response to this challenge, Anwar was sacked. 
Anwar's bizarre trial and sentencing on charges of sodomy and abuse of power invigorated the reformasi movement, as growing anti-UMNO and anti-Mahathir sentiments took hold among Islamic-minded Malays.
This culminated in poor electoral results for the ruling coalition in November 1999.
The Islamist party, Parti Islam SeMalaysia (PAS), took power in the states of Kelantan and Trengganu and strongly threatened UMNO in other northern states.
The personal conflict between Mahathir and Anwar thus led to an apparent rupture between Malaysia's Islamist political forces and the modernizers of UMNO.
So, once again, Mahathir felt pressure to adopt a strategy aimed at preventing Islam from becoming a tool of opposition.
This impulse strongly affected his choice of a successor when he decided to step down as prime minister.
His choice of Abdullah Badawi, the current prime minister, helped UMNO regain the Islamist moral high ground that the PAS had been claiming.
It was the beginning of America's global "war on terror" in 2001, however, that brought the political march of the Islamist parties to a screeching halt, as it provided an excuse for the government to crack down on the Malay right and the PAS.
But this only renewed UMNO's desire to portray itself as sufficiently Islamist.
So, before stepping down, Mahathir went so far as to declare Malaysia a de facto Muslim state.
Eyebrows were raised and questions were asked about the lengths to which Mahathir would go to counteract the Islamist appeal.
This trend continues.
One of Badawi's first acts after taking over as prime minister in October 2003 was to introduce the concept of Islam Hadhari.
This vague term was finally fleshed out with a list of ten principles in September 2004, all but one of which, however, was without religious connotations.
Nevertheless, this move appeared to be all that was needed for Islam-minded voters to return to the fold of the ruling front.
In the general election in March 2004 -- the first since Mahathir stepped down after 22 years in power -- moderate Muslims helped Abdullah Badawi to a landslide victory.
The release of Anwar Ibrahim soon afterwards raised the new premier's prestige further as a leader who could heal intra-Malay, and intra-Muslim, conflicts.
Since then, Abdullah Badawi has been popularizing the concept of "Hadhari," shaping it as a means to shift Islam's focus from its sanctioning function to its civilizing potential and rendering it less ideological.
In Malaysia today, Islam is being presented as a generator of civilization and culture, and not merely as a source of religious inspiration.
This has helped to counter extremist tendencies domestically and provides a conceptual platform for moderate Islam.
Islam Hadhari tries to project the idea that UMNO's materialism and nationalism do not contradict Islam.
With various feints and strategies, Malaysia has effectively managed the tensions between a secular, modernizing agenda and the Islamic faith that the Malays profess.
By making Islamists and Islamist sentiments a part of the process of modernization, Malaysia demonstrates that Islamic faith and economic growth can be reconciled if politicians are clever enough not to treat them as contradictions.
Making European Defense a Reality
The EU's goal is to be a global player with its own foreign policy, one shared by its 27 member states.
Any effective foreign policy clearly needs to rely on effective military and civilian resources.
But this goal does not mean that the EU will compete with NATO.
Whereas NATO is a political-military alliance, the EU endorses the development of a community of national destinies.
Moreover, NATO benefits from the military might of a dominant nation, while the EU must depend on the shared voluntary efforts of its members.
For two key reasons, it would be more correct to say that NATO and the European Security and Defense Policy (ESDP) are complementary.
First, certain countries turn specifically to Europe for help.
Whether in sub-Saharan Africa or the Middle East, their populations and governments are more inclined -- for political, historical, or cultural reasons -- to request European rather than NATO assistance.
Conversely, there are certain long-term crises, such as those provoked by terrorism, for which NATO is better placed to act.
For example, given its member states' current resources, the EU, acting alone, would be unable to ensure a Western commitment in Afghanistan.
At the same time, the governments of Chad and the Central African Republic would never have accepted NATO's intervention to help resolve the Darfur crisis.
Second, the EU is building its crisis management know-how on the basis of a global approach.
Military resources are only one tool among many others, and, generally speaking, their deployment is clearly defined, limited in time, and coordinated with civilian action.
As a result, the EU doesn't need the articulated military structure that NATO possesses.
The recent creation in Brussels of the Civilian Planning Conduct Capability, based on a system comparable to that of a military chain of command, demonstrates -- and, above all, guarantees -- cohesive action.
In the same way, EUFOR military commanders regularly and frequently exchange information with the heads of such EU civil missions as the EUPOL police mission, the EUSEC security reform mission, the EUJUST justice mission, and so on, including, if present, the European Commission's own representatives.
Being able to act militarily requires capable, flexible forces that are suited to their mission.
Their essential tasks should be movement, information gathering, and, if necessary, combat.
Moreover, their main qualities should be resistance -- the ability to hold out -- and the psychological resilience to deal successfully with an "intense" situation and to respond to it by exerting the best possible control.
This implies a high level of cohesion, which in the case of multinational forces is not guaranteed.
But the EU's "Battlegroups" are a first response to this requirement.
As multinational forces that are built either on regional affiliations or strong bilateral relations, they bestow a "European" label on military resources while guaranteeing efficiency in the field.
Where necessary, they can be supported by air and maritime rapid response assets, and thus constitute a fully-fledged military resource for armed intervention.
However, although about 15 Battlegroups have been created -- two of which are, at any time, on permanent call for six months -- none has actually been deployed since the Artemis "prototype" mission to the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2003.
As time passes, a concept without real commitment in the field may eventually raise suspicions about its relevance.
The EU also suffers from a well-known lack of capacity in strategic air transport, in-theater air transport, and combat support.
The European Defense Agency has a very important role to play in proposing and running programs to address these shortfalls.
The Capability Development Plan, which the EDA is developing in close collaboration with the EU Military Committee, aims to foster and improve solidarity in terms of capability, which is what Europe needs.
There are other areas in which we must make progress if the EU's military resources are to be brought into line with its political ambitions.
One urgent need is simplification of our operational planning and the manner in which we conduct operations.
Finally, as all of the EU's 27 member states are now trying to reduce public spending in sustainable ways, financing for military operations, without which nothing is possible, requires a new approach.
Those member states that are most heavily involved in an operation, in terms of both human resources and military equipment, are penalized by the financial burden that this commitment places on their national budgets.
Political solidarity must be underpinned by effective financial solidarity.
As an integral part of the CFSP, today's ESDP and tomorrow's Common Security and Defense Policy will work only if the member states responsible for implementing them allocate the resources that they need.
This implies a Europe-based approach that takes precedence over national considerations once national and European-level foreign policies are unified.
Reforming Germany's Army
MUNICH: What are the military threats European countries now face?
What forces are required to meet them?
How much are governments willing to pay?
The debate over these issues has now reached West Europe's biggest army, Germany's Bundeswehr.
Its outcome concerns not only Germans but their partners in Nato and the EU as well.
It is a belated debate here.
The Cold War ended a decade ago, and most of Germany's allies conducted their debate years ago.
If Germany has lagged, it is for two reasons: Germany's security environment has undergone the most dramatic change, and Germans remain deeply attached to military conscription.
Revolutions happen quickly but it takes time to adjust to the changes they bring.
For half-a-century, Germany was the point where the Cold War was most likely to turn hot.
Then, beginning in the spring of 1990, Germany united, the Warsaw Pact and USSR disintegrated, and countries to Germany's east, which had been the staging post for Soviet tank armies, suddenly became friends, then partners.
In 1994 the last Russian soldier left German soil.
That would have been the moment to take stock of Germany's new strategic situation.
But Helmut Kohl's government feared that any examination would unravel the central feature of the army created in the mid-1950s and a major condition for its wide acceptance in the country: military conscription.
The military embraces conscription because it assures the armed forces of high-quality recruits and a close link to civil society; politicians like it because it helps make the armed forces transparent; agencies of the welfare state appreciate it because, without conscription, there would be no conscientious objectors to be usefully (and cheaply) employed in all sorts of social tasks.
So the armed forces found themselves in a double bind: the Cold War's end prompted calls for a peace dividend and for unification to be funded.
Germany's defense budget slid to lower levels even faster than did those of her allies.
But to maintain conscription implied a large and costly military structure which bloated personal expenditure at the price of squeezing the budget share of military investment.
The result is an army neither manned nor equipped for dealing with likely security threats, nor for cooperating with the armed forces of Germany's allies.
So reform became inevitable.
Because the conservatives of Helmut Kohl did not address it, Gerhard Schroeder's left coalition had to.
A year ago, it set up an independent "Commission on Common Security and the Future of the Armed Forces" under the chairmanship of Richard von Weizsaecker, the respected former President of the Republic.
Earlier this week, the Commission's report was published.
A debate long in coming is finally beginning.
The 179 page document does not mince words.
The Bundeswehr has no future in its current structure.
Germany is no longer threatened by invading armies; she is surrounded by allies in Nato and partners in the EU.
This strategic condition is here to stay.
Instead of the capability for repulsing a massive attack on its borders, the armed forces need to be able to intervene in and manage crises B whether within or beyond Nato B in joint operations with their closest allies.
Hence what counts is the number and equipment of forces deployable for crisis operations.
At the moment, barely sixty thousand soldiers qualify; the Weizsaecker Commission calls for an increase to 140,000 of different stages of readiness, sufficient to intervene in two simultaneous crises.
At the same time, it proposes a drastic reduction in the overall size of the Bundeswehr: from the current 320,000 to no more than 240,000 men and women (yes, women: they will be eligible for practically all military functions).
The number of conscripts, with a military service of 10 months, should be 30,000 a year, down from the present 130,000.
In other words: the number of soldiers needed for the new tasks goes up, while the total of the armed forces goes down.
The resulting savings are proposed to modernize military hardware and equip the forces for future tasks.
Just as soldiers and their means should be geared to these, so the chain of command needs to be streamlined to assure rapid deployment of combined forces, in close coordination with allies, and with political oversight guaranteed.
It will take up to six years, the Commission estimates, to manage the transition from the present to the future Bundeswehr, and Weizs"cker suggests a program budget to make sure the reform stays on course.
But if it does, Germany will be fully capable of honoring commitments she has undertaken in Nato and the EU.
Indeed, the reform will give a boost to much closer European defence cooperation by increasing interoperability with major European allies and encouraging joint procurement, joint production and joint management of military investment.
Now politicians are taking over.
In the ensuing public debate, two items have already emerged as central: money and conscription B one politically demanding, the other politically convenient.
These reforms will not come cheap.
Although the new Bundeswehr will be more cost-efficient, it will need money to manage the changeover, more than currently planned by a government set on a laudable course of fiscal consolidation.
Will Chancellor Schroeder be willing to commit himself to reforms which will bring fruit only after the next elections?
Conscription is another matter.
While one third of the Commission members favored a volunteer army, the majority supported conscription, albeit with a smaller number of call-ups than today.
Their reasoning: Since the future is uncertain, it makes sense to retain the flexibility conscription permits, to respond both to unforeseen changes in the security environment and to shortfalls in the recruitment of volunteers; here the difficulties that allied armies are encountering which have jettisoned conscription have been a warning.
But the number of young men to be called up depends on the requirements of the forces; hence the Commission insists on no less than ten months' service. This explains the much reduced figure of only 30.000 a year.
It is this part of the proposal which is encountering most criticism.
Most political parties reject it, preferring instead to draft a much higher number.
The Commission's selective draft, they argue is unconstitutional because it allows the large majority of eligible young men to escape conscription.
This may not be the last word in the debate.
For to argue that the draft is only just if everyone is called up regardless of military requirements is unconvincing, provided those that are drafted are compensated for their service.
Moreover, to draft more than one needs is a costly luxury.
That recognition is gradually sinking in, at least in the government.
Defense Minister Scharping who is currently preparing his own proposals for the future Bundeswehr, also envisages a major reduction in the number of conscripts though not as drastic as the Commission wants.
Less money and more conscripts will slow down, and possibly derail, the Weizsaecker reforms.
But then commissions propose, politicians dispose.
They are under greater constraints than independent advisers, they get the credit for success but also bear the risk of failure.
It would be naive, therefore, to demand that they should not deviate from the script that Weizsaecker wrote.
It would be wrong, as some are doing, to dismiss the Report as an inconsequential wishlist.
In one year of hard work, Weizsaecker's group has done what no other body in government or parliament can do: define the benchmark for needed reforms.
Politicians will deviate, but they will have to account for it if and when they do.
That is why it is safe to say: reform of the Bundeswehr is finally under way.
They were kept out of parliament because, in truth, they represent more than themselves; they stand for people who sincerely wish to defend the idea of a "liberal Russia," a country that is free and democratic.
They were basically destroyed politically -- scared away, fired from various jobs, or forced to leave the country.
There is more than a whiff of hypocrisy in Putin's anti-oligarch campaigns.
Among the people persecuting the oligarchs, I haven't met one who isn't trying to become an oligarch himself.
Indeed, Putin's treasured KGB cronies, who are supposed to be such ascetic hard men, all seem to be marrying their government jobs with lucrative posts in state-owned enterprises.
The infamous Igor Sechin, the Cardinal Richelieu of Putin's Kremlin, somehow also manages to have time to be the chairman of Rosneft, the big state oil concern.
Two conditions marked Russia's oligarchs for persecution.
First, they could foresee the future more clearly than others.
So when everybody thought that Russia was about to become a market economy, they had seen that the turn had already happened -- and so were miles ahead of the game.
Supporting Human Embryonic Stem Cell Research
Most of the cells in our bodies have a short life span and a specific job to do.
Stem cells, found in many organs from skin to bone marrow, are different.
The "ancestors" of ordinary cells, they can replenish themselves indefinitely.
Given the right biochemical signals, these cells can divide and transform themselves into a range of different cell types as and when the need arises.
Such versatility means that stem cells have the potential to regenerate damaged organ tissues and provide amazing new treatments for a range of now devastating diseases.
Indeed, stem cells may perhaps make it possible for humans to "grow new organs" to replace diseased ones, thereby providing for the possibility of new forms of cell-based therapies.
On the basis of research with comparable cells from mice, scientists envision that stem cells could be used to replace bone marrow in patients suffering from cancer, produce pancreatic cells for alleviating diabetes, or neuronal cells for treating Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and various brain and spinal cord disorders.
Stem cells used in this research are best derived from very early stage embryos created by in vitro fertilization, but this leads to ethical dilemmas.
The idea that human embryos could be created with the express purpose of "harvesting" them for medical purposes incites fear of a "brave new world" revisited.
Even if that extreme is unlikely, the possibility of abuse of any sort generates strong opposition.
Most of those who oppose stem cell research do not question its scientific and medical value, but object to the use of human embryos.
These critics, especially in Germany, where stem cell research evokes nightmares of Nazi era eugenics, argue that research with stem cells derived from embryos is unnecessary because multi-potential stem cells occur naturally in adult tissues as well.
While guardedly encouraged by recent reports of the remarkable plasticity of stem cells obtained from adult tissues, scientists know little about their potential for prolonged maintenance outside the body, their capacity for differentiation, and whether they can be obtained in the quantities needed to explore their utility for clinical use.
If embryonic stem cell research were to be halted based on that hope, it is possible that years may pass before scientists could determine if adult-derived stem cells are equivalent to embryonic stem cells in their potential to treat disease.
We cannot afford the luxury of proceeding with these promising technologies sequentially.
We owe it to those who are in need to explore all possible avenues that could lead to medical cures.
While research on adult-derived stem cells should be pursued aggressively, it should not be at the expense of an aggressive program to explore the full potential of stem cells for use in human therapies.
Another restriction has been recently adopted in the United States, where the issue was explored by the National Biomedical Ethics Advisory Commission in extensive hearings and discussions with ethicists, religious leaders, scientists and physicians.
They concluded that it is ethically permissible to prepare stem cell lines from frozen embryos, but only from those obtained in the course of in vitro fertilization procedures and deemed by donors and their physician to be in excess of clinical requirements.
(More eggs are usually fertilized than are actually implanted in women who want to become pregnant.)
Following these discussions, the US National Institute of Health (NIH) promulgated guidelines that allow the use of government funds for stem-cell research but, in their present form, prohibit federally-funded investigators from creating new stem cell lines.
That restriction requires that stem cell lines must be obtained only from privately-funded or commercial sources that follow the protocols mandated by the guidelines.
I believe that restricting the use of government funds for the creation of stem cells, although politically prudent, imposes substantial scientific handicaps.
We know that a variety of poorly understood factors cause embryonic stem cells to lose their capacity to differentiate into all possible cell types.
This loss of capacity to differentiate may be caused by the particular mode in which the stem cells are derived, the conditions surrounding their growth, and other variables of handling.
Enabling individual government-funded investigators to derive stem cell lines using a variety of conditions in their own laboratories, as permitted recently in Britain and France, is the best route to determining what conditions are critical for generating cells for specific therapeutic purposes.
Embryonic stem cells prepared in a scientist's own laboratory are most likely to have been derived, stored and maintained in ways that maximize their potency for particular uses.
Cells obtained from commercial sources are likely to be of unknown genetic background and history and therefore be less useful for some important studies.
While various remote contingencies are sometimes invoked, the fundamental ethical choice posed by stem cell research is more circumscribed: whether human embryos, which will ultimately be legally discarded, should be used to create potentially life-saving therapies for those in need.
Those who oppose abortion irrespective of its purpose argue that sacrificing a human embryo to obtain stem cells is akin to abortion and therefore immoral.
But harvesting stem cells from very early stage embryos that will in the end be discarded is, in my view, ethically distinct from abortion.
For we must also consider the moral consequences of failing to pursue this line of research if it has the potential to save and improve human lives.
What greater morality exists than doing all we can do to help individuals whose lives are blighted by disease and disability?
Religious Pluralism for a Pluralist Age
The election of Pope Benedict XVI and the global war on terror have brought unprecedented attention to the role of religion in our world.
There has been particular interest (most specifically in the case of Islam) as to whether specific religious traditions are compatible with the institutions and values of liberal democracy.
But focusing exclusively on what is believed and practiced overlooks a potentially far more important question: how religious precepts are believed and practiced.
Despite massive evidence to the contrary, many people -- not least theologians -- fear that we live in a secular age.
But, far from being characterized by secularization, our age has witnessed vast eruptions of religious passion.
The modern age is as religious as any previous historical period, and in some places more so.
One exception is geographical: Western and Central Europe have indeed experienced a significant decline of religion, which has become an important ingredient of European cultural identity.
The other exception is sociological, comprising a relatively thin but influential international intelligentsia, for whom secularization has become not only a fact, but, at least for some of its members, an ideological commitment.
These are exceptions.
What modernity more or less inevitably brings about is not secularization but pluralism -- the peaceful co-existence of different racial, ethnic, or religious groups in the same society.
Modernity undermines communities' traditional homogeneity, because insiders and outsiders constantly rub up against each other, either physically (through urbanization and travel) or "virtually" (through mass literacy and mass communication).
Pluralism -- accelerated, expanded, and intensified by globalization -- has become a pervasive fact of social life and individuals' consciousness.
On the institutional level, pluralism means that established religions can no longer take for granted that a particular population will supinely submit to its authority.
If freedom of religion is guaranteed -- the typical situation in liberal democracies -- religious institutions cannot rely on the state to fill their pews.
Instead, people must be persuaded to accept such authority, giving rise to something like a religious market.
Even if one religious tradition still claims a majority of a population as its nominal adherents, individuals can still choose to disaffiliate from the institution representing that tradition (as in the Catholic majority countries of Europe).
At the level of individual consciousness, this means that religious certainty is now harder to come by.
A religious decision can be a matter of passionate commitment (as in Kierkegaard's "leap of faith"), or, more commonly, an emotionally low-intensity consumer option (expressed in the telling American phrase "religious preference").
In either case, the individual is thrown back on himself to reflect upon and come to terms with his native religious tradition.
Even if an individual decides to affirm a very conservative version of a tradition, this decision may, at least in principle, be revoked at some future time.
As a result, pluralism pressures churches to become denominations. A denomination has the characteristics of a church, into which one is born, but individuals adhere to it voluntarily and it accepts other denominations' right to exist.
From the standpoint of their compatibility with modern liberal democracy, acceptance of pluralism, more than adherence to particular beliefs and practices, may be what most clearly distinguishes religions.
Within Christianity, for well-known historical reasons, Protestantism has had a comparative advantage in adapting to pluralism.
The Roman Catholic Church, after a long period of fierce resistance, also has adapted successfully to pluralist competition, legitimating it theologically in the declarations on religious liberty that began with the Second Vatican Council.
Acceptance of the market economy has been slower, but that, too, has begun since the encyclical Centesimus Annus of John Paul II.
Eastern Christian Orthodoxy is, however, a different matter.
The relation of divine and secular fuels passionate debate throughout the Islamic world and in Israel, but the Orthodox idea of sinfonia -- the harmonious unity between society, state, and church -- constitutes a distinctive challenge to the acceptance of liberal democracy.
And comparable Orthodox ideas about communal solidarity (Russian sobornost ) make it difficult to accept capitalism, because competition and individual entrepreneurship are seen as a morally repulsive expression of ruthlessness and greed.
Responses to the challenge of global pluralism will take different forms in different parts of the Orthodox world.
There may be efforts to re-establish something like the traditional sinfonia , as in Russia; embrace of "Eurosecularity," as in Greece, Cyprus, and other countries entering the EU's orbit (Romania and Bulgaria sooner, Armenia and Georgia later); or moves toward voluntary association, as in the US.
But the challenge facing Orthodoxy underscores the three options that all contemporary religious communities now face: to resist pluralism, to withdraw from it, or to engage with it.
None is without difficulties and risks, but only engagement is compatible with liberal democracy.
Engagement means that the tradition is carried into the open discourse of the culture, and that those who represent the tradition make unapologetic truth claims.
This will inevitably lead to charges of "proselytizing," a term that has come to carry a pejorative meaning.
But proselytizing means only that one tries to convince others of the truths to which one is committed.
A self-confident community will usually do just that.
To put it bluntly: instead of worrying that Roman Catholics will "steal" Orthodox souls, the Orthodox should try to steal Catholic souls.
Barring that, in an age when religions must persuade , they must still "proselytize" within the community -- pointing out the truth, the values, and the beauty of the tradition -- even if they refrain from doing so outside it.
Otherwise, they will lose their children.
Slamming the Euro Door
Under the proposal that was openly discussed in Frankfurt, in addition to the macroeconomic Maastricht criteria that have been in place since the euro's launch, the quality of a country's banking system would be used as an additional criterion for euro entry.
Leaving aside the hypocrisy of Western governments pontificating on this topic while they are bailing out banks after massive regulatory failures, the proposal is seriously flawed.
To fully appreciate the proposal's absurdity, consider the extraordinarily successful East European growth model of the past two decades.
The model advocated by Western Europe and embraced by Eastern Europe has been based on the idea that capital should flow from capital-rich to capital-poor countries.
Economists have to go back to the nineteenth-century United States to find a similar textbook example of successful growth, with large current-account deficits financed mainly through foreign direct investment.
Financial flows have been accompanied by unprecedented financial integration, with most East European banks now controlled by Western parents.
This model has worked remarkably well not just in generating growth, but also, as documented in the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development's 2008 Transition Report , in improving the institutions that support markets and democracy in Eastern Europe.
But it has also left these countries vulnerable to the twists and turns of global financial markets.
Over the last year and a half, they withstood these pressures remarkably well; but, as the global crisis hits them with full force, they are now seeking help from the International Monetary Fund.
The main vulnerability in the current crisis has been massive exposure to foreign exchange movements.
Actors in all parts of the economy, households and companies alike, have bet that their local currencies would continue to appreciate.
Mortgages in Swiss francs and car loans in Japanese yen have been common throughout the region.
But it was probably in Hungary, the first country to seek an IMF package, that these practices were most widespread.
Yet this vulnerability was largely created, or at least accommodated, by Western banks.
The funding from the parent banks that in the earlier phase of the crisis helped provide liquidity to the East European banking systems now appears more as a liability and possible source of contagion.
It was also the West European financial regulators and supervisors who, under "home rule," were supposed to discourage these excesses.
The penetration of foreign banks has also effectively deprived countries in Central and Eastern Europe of monetary policy tools, leaving them with little control over extremely rapid credit growth.
Add to this the impact of the current West European bank rescue packages on the banking systems of Eastern Europe.
On one hand, these programs help promote stability by supporting the parent banks active in the region.
On the other hand, the interventions have also undermined the East European financial systems. 
Governments in Eastern Europe cannot credibly match the broad deposit guarantees issued by their Western neighbors, and the generous recapitalizations have brought down Western banks' relative funding costs, further weakening local institutions' competitiveness.
Finally, many governments explicitly or implicitly restrict parent banks' ability to use government funds to back up their East European subsidiaries, many of them critical to the stability of the local financial systems.
To make the quality of the banking system a new criterion for euro membership is not only hypocritical; it is also counterproductive.
Relatively high levels of inflation have been the main reason why euro membership was perceived as increasingly remote in most countries, and why the prospect of euro entry has had a diminishing impact on domestic reform efforts.
A small consolation in the current crisis is that inflation rates are now coming down.
More importantly, the crisis has demonstrated the value for these small economies of being part of a larger currency area.
Instead of exploiting the current opportunity of unprecedented leverage over euro candidates to push them to meet the Maastricht criteria, euro incumbents are contemplating a new and exceedingly vague criterion based on the quality of banking systems.
And whose banks are these?
Who are we kidding?
Europe Through American Eyes
Europeans are constantly reminded of all that is wrong with America.
But perhaps Europeans should reverse the process: what do Americans think is wrong with Europe?
Above all, Americans see Europe as a continent of self-inflicted stagnation - and with good reason.
Economic growth in the EU was near zero in 2003.
Several countries, most notably Germany and France, seem hobbled by inflexible labor markets and regulations that inhibit dynamism.
The European Union's highly touted "Lisbon Declaration" of a few years ago, which proclaimed that Europe would become the world's most competitive region by 2010, appears laughable to Americans, whose productivity gains seem to scale new heights constantly.
America also sees Europe as excessively inward looking, sometimes dangerously so.
Worse, informed Americans see anti-Semitism running rampant in Europe and xenophobic political parties on the march in country after country.
Not even pacific Scandinavia is exempt from this.
Americans see a total inability by Europe to handle immigration in ways that encourage dynamism and diversity instead of antagonism and higher state spending.
This seems all the more puzzling because Americans realize how badly Europe needs new immigrants, given its extremely low fertility rates.
Europe's perceived attitude towards rogue states and global terrorism only enhances this perception of self-satisfied inwardness.
Americans may differ about what policy should have been pursued in Iraq, but they know that their country cannot run from its role as a world leader responsible for developments in North Korea, the Middle East, Pakistan/India, Taiwan, and elsewhere.
It is a jungle out there, as Americans say; not every problem and conflict can be handled through the sort of peaceful, drawn-out negotiations that the EU prefers.
Germany and France were against meeting Saddam Hussein with military force, but had no alternative for getting rid of the butcher of Baghdad. "What was the European answer to the problem of Saddam Hussein?" asked Senator Joe Biden in a panel discussion at the recent Davos forum.
Biden is a Democrat and strong critic of President Bush. "I asked French and German leaders, but never received any credible answer."
"We are not even ready to forcefully meet conflicts on our own continent," Polish President Aleksander Kwasniewski sighed.
Bosnia's Muslims thank America, not the EU, for their deliverance from slaughter.
Europe devotes half as much in financial resources to the military as the US, resulting in one-tenth of America's military strength, observed Pat Cox, Speaker of the European Parliament.
Americans now see Europe as compounding its military weakness by losing its leading position in science.
Two thirds of Nobel Laureates in the sciences during the last quarter century were Americans; many of the others do or did research at American universities.
According to Time magazine, 400,000 European researchers now work in the US.
Lack of funding, bureaucracies so complicated that even purchasing a used computer is problematic, hierarchies that hamper the joy of curiosity and creativity: all of these barriers confront European scientists and are responsible for inciting today's "brain drain" to America.
Add economics to this recipe as well.
Price regulations and other ill-considered features of European policy contribute to the fact that 60% of the world's new drugs are developed in the US, compared to 40% only ten years ago.
This sterility and inertia make Europe less and less interesting for Americans.
So American eyes are turning elsewhere: to China with its 1.3 billion people and an economy growing at 8-10%, year in and year out, and to India, with its 1.1 billion people and 6% annual growth.
Indeed, India now has some of the world's best engineers, IT technicians and medical professionals.
India probably encompasses the world's largest middle class.
With new patent laws coming into place, India will have the same attraction for the pharmaceutical industry as it has for IT, providing clinical trials for new drugs at a quarter of the cost of Europe or the US.
While America increases its population somewhat, due to normal reproductive rates and large immigration flows, Europe's share of the world's population is approaching a mere 4% and seems doomed to growing older as it shrinks even more.
Demographic change in the US is also working to change America's global orientation.
With American immigration dominated by Latin Americans and Asians, the US feels its European heritage less.
Similarly, domestic US politics is gravitating to the country's south and west, regions that look towards Latin America and Asia, not Europe.
The fall of the Soviet empire, naturally, reduced Americans' security interest in Europe.
Is this American-eye view of Europe unfair?
Perhaps.
It is, however, no more unfair than how America is regularly portrayed in Europe's media these days.
But if Americans are critical of Europe, they are also self-critical, far more so than most Europeans.
As a European editor wrote apropos the flow of scientists from Europe to America: "What's most sad is that Europeans still believe that their society represents the epitome of civilization, while the US is on its way to downfall.
What if the reality is the reverse?"
Every European should contemplate that possibility, at least for a moment, before resuming their current aversion to all things American.
The Search for Quality on the Web
Indeed, today you can fit more books on the hard disk of your laptop computer than in a bookstore carrying 60,000 titles.
The number of Web pages on the Internet is rumored to have exceeded 500 billion, enough to fill 10 modern aircraft carriers with the equivalent number of 500-page, one-pound books.
Such analogies help us visualize the immensity of the information explosion and ratify the concerns that come with it.
Web search engines are the only mechanism with which to navigate this avalanche of information, so they should not be mistaken for an optional accessory, one of the buttons to play with, or a tool to locate the nearest pizza store.
Search engines are the single most powerful distribution points of knowledge, wealth, and yes, misinformation.
When we talk about Web search, the first name that pops up is, of course, Google.
It is not far-fetched to say that Google made the Internet what it is today.
It shaped a new generation of people who are strikingly different from their parents.
Baby boomers might be the best placed to appreciate this, since they experienced Rock 'n' Roll as kids and Google as parents.
Google's design was based on statistical algorithms.
But search technologies that are based on statistical algorithms cannot address the quality of information, simply because high-quality information is not always popular, and popular information is not always high-quality.
You can collect statistics until the cows come home, but you cannot expect statistics to produce an effect beyond what they are good for.
In addition, statistics collection systems are backward-looking.
They need time for people to make referrals, and time to collect them.
Therefore, new publications and dynamic pages that change their content frequently are already beyond the scope of the popularity methods, and searching this material is vulnerable to rudimentary techniques of manipulation.
For example, the inefficiencies of today's search engines have created a new industry called Search Engine Optimization, which focuses on strategies to make Web pages rank high against the popularity criteria of Google-esque search engines.
It is a billion-dollar industry.
The underlying idea behind semantic technology is to teach computers how the world operates.
For example, when a computer encounters the word "bill," it would know that "bill" has 15 different meanings in English.
When the computer encounters the phrase "killed the bill," it would deduce that "bill" can only be a proposed law submitted to a legislature, and that "kill" could mean only "stop."
By contrast, "kill bill" would only be the title of the movie by that name.
At the end, a series of deductions like these would handle entire sentences and paragraphs to yield an accurate text-meaning representation.
To achieve this level of dexterity in handling languages by computer algorithms, an ontology must be built.
Ontology is neither a dictionary nor a thesaurus.
It is a map of interconnected concepts and word senses that reflect relationships such as those that exist between the concepts of "bill" and "kill."
Building an ontology encapsulating the world's knowledge may be an immense task, requiring an effort comparable to compiling a large encyclopedia and the expertise to build it, but it is feasible.
The result of these efforts remains to be seen.
Nato's Next Moves East
BERLIN: Nato's next summit will take place in Prague in the winter of 2002 -- that is, if President Bush doesn't call his allies together before then.
But the questions to be answered leading up to the summit are already clear: which, if any, country will be asked to join Nato; when will any new member join?
Whatever decisions are taken, it is also clear that preparatory work must begin as soon as possible, and at least before the end of the year.
All this is different from 1997, when Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic joined Nato.
Back then, the outcome of the Madrid summit that agreed to their membership was uncertain until the final moments.
That uncertainty ended when America succeeded in limiting invitations to three chosen countries, surprising those Alliance members who supported other candidates.
Today, the most important issue facing Nato concerns whether or not to admit the Baltic states -- Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania -- now, after some delay, or never.
Turning down or delaying Baltic state membership will be seen as a concession to Russia; acting in their favor will be regarded by Moscow as a slap-in-the-face.
No matter what decision Nato takes, containing the negative fall-out -- in Russia or the Baltics -- will not be easy.
So a surprise conclusion in the manner of Madrid will only make matters worse, because careful preparations will be needed to contain the damage, and too much time will be lost if everything is put off until the meeting in Prague.
Some Nato members hope to evade these problems altogether through delay.
Why not postpone enlargement, they ask, until some of the states demanding to join Nato have gained EU membership, where elements of their security concerns may be met?
But postponement is not a viable option, for the following reasons:
- Russia itself placed membership for the Baltic three atop Nato's agenda.
Time and again Moscow has thundered that Nato's first eastward enlargement must be its last.
Bringing the Baltic states into Nato, Russia claims, would severely compromise its security (for that read Russian self-esteem).
The strength of these protests, however, will make dawdling over Nato enlargement appear as a kowtow to President Putin;
- The West promised to continue enlargement at the Washington Summit of April 1999.
Back then Nato heads-of-state welcomed the progress of various candidate countries, commending the Baltic states in particular.
Nato's leaders also promised to revisit enlargement by 2002 at the latest.
So they cannot repeat the same formula in Prague and remain credible in both Russia and Eastern Europe;
- EU enlargement takes time while Nato enlargement is relatively speedy.
Were negotiations over EU-admission of the Baltics near conclusion, postponing Nato-membership could be justified because the EU, with its new defense identity, is now both a security and prosperity union.
As EU members, the Baltic states would indirectly come under Nato's security shield, making explicit membership unnecessary perhaps.
Unfortunately, years will elapse before negotiations over EU membership will conclude and be ratified.
Stalling until that time is postponement by other means.
- At the Cold War's end, Nato redefined itself as a stability network for all the Euro-Atlantic community, which includes Eastern Europe's new democracies.
Arguments which say that, because no direct security risk exists there is no need for a Nato guarantee of the Baltics -- a view that sometimes gains attention in Berlin -- break with this redefinition.
Even if some Nato members want to distance themselves from this strategy, the Bush Administration unambiguously supports Nato's role as a stability network.
Neither putative EU membership nor today's favorable security conditions justify postponing enlargement.
Diplomatic tricks cannot finesse the issue.
Nato must either say "Yes" or "No" to the Baltic states.
(To be precise, Nato must treat the applications of all three Baltic countries together.
If only one were invited to join as a symbol of western determination, Russia would interpret this as appeasement, not steadfastness)
If Nato says "Yes" to the Baltics, it must make both Moscow and the Baltic three understand that enlargement is meant to increase stability along Russia's western border, not threaten Russia.
As a signal to both, Nato's military presence in the Baltics should be kept to a minimum.
In addition, the prospect of a democratic Russia eventually joining Nato might be openly acknowledged.
Both must be done before any new enlargement is announced.
If Nato rejects the Baltic states it will need to prevent Moscow from interpreting that decision as confirmation that Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania remain locked within Russia's sphere of influence and that its Great Power posturing has paid off.
Both inferences are potentially disastrous, not only for relations between West and Eastern Europe but, more importantly, for relations between Russia and the West.
Russia must be persuaded to confirm -- explicitly and formally -- the right of the Baltics, on their own, to choose their allies.
In view of Moscow's insistence that it will never accept such a decision, this will not be easy.
Moreover, if Nato membership for the Baltics is rejected, they will need reassurance that the West will assist them, concretely, should their security be put at risk.
Admission or postponement are both legitimate decisions.
But each will require considerable early efforts to reduce their fall-out.
In weighing these options, admission of the Baltic countries quickly seems the better solution.
Efforts to contain the damage caused by postponement will likely be far more demanding than any effort needed to ease tension after enlargement is announced.
Moreover, at the next Summit following Prague, the Baltics must be at any rate be granted what, in view of their history, they have every right to demand: to be part of a stability alliance that is a matter of course for western democracies.
Europe's Public and the Anti-Terrorism War
BERLIN: Chancellor Schröder's government coalition barely scraped through Germany's Bundestag to secure the support it needed to dispatch German soldiers to help in the campaign against international terrorism.
No doubt special circumstances accompanied that vote, but the effort which the country's most respected and powerful politician expended in order to gain the backing of Germany's parliament (as well as his coalition partners, the Greens) should be a warning to other Western governments not to leave their publics behind as they engage in the tough, multi-year campaign against the planners and executors of international terrorism.
In the first weeks after the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon governments all over Europe were certain of public support.
That changed when the US bombing against the Taliban began; doubts over the wisdom of the US campaign combined with resentment at seeing a super-modern superpower pound away at a medieval country devastated by decades of war.
These doubts were moderated somewhat as America's strategy began to produce results. But they are certain to resurface and grow as memories of September 11
Maintaining public support within the US is no problem for America's leadership.
Americans are both shocked and angered by the attack on their cherished invulnerability and are determined to pursue the perpetrators with every means at their disposal.
President Bush has made this his top priority; for as long as he is in the White House, he will not waver in this pursuit and neither will his people.
But to retain popular backing will be a problem in Western Europe, America's closest allies.
Should they cease to support the US, the unique transatlantic partnership could disintegrate.
A wounded America appreciated the spontaneous demonstrations of sympathy and solidarity that poured across the Atlantic after September 11
European governments know this.
After all, not only moral outrage but calculated self-interest led them on September 12
Yet this policy demands a commitment for the long haul.
Unless it is explained and seen as an expression of national interest, it will strain domestic political support, even to the degree of endangering government coalitions like that of Mr. Schröder.
Of all Europe's governments, only that of Prime Minister Tony Blair in Britain has developed a strategy that successfully combines solidarity for the US with retaining public support at home.
Admittedly, going to war is much less an anathema for Britons than for continental Europeans.
Yet Blair did not rely on this alone.
From the start, he declared that the attacks on New York were directly aimed at his country.
When he called on British forces it was thus for the common defense, not just to serve the US.
He insisted on being consulted by the Bush administration on US plans, and when some in Washington thought aloud about taking on Iraq after Afghanistan, the Prime Minister registered a clear veto.
All this signaled to allies abroad and citizens at home that Britain's cooperation should not be taken for granted, that it requires domestic approval.
By contrast, continental leaders have done little to dispel the impression that they are acting in response to a US request and for a US cause.
But their people rightly demand that government should not just serve the interests of others.
If they wish to stay the course in the struggle against international terrorism, European leaders must take a leaf or two from Blair's book.
For one, they have to emphasize that this is their own struggle, not just America's.
For another, they will have to make their own, distinct contribution.
They cannot simply wait for America to move, nor can they always seek to placate Washington's preferences.
In short, they will have to make their own efforts to sustain the common effort.
What this distinct contribution could be is not difficult to define.
After all, only the ingrained habit of playing second fiddle to the US prevents EU members from clearly and loudly distancing themselves from Israel's repressive interferences on the West Bank and Gaza, even though such a stance would help strengthen the commitment of Arab states to the coalition against terrorism as well as provide a useful shove to American diplomacy.
The same applies to a European effort to rebuild relations with Iran, or a joint initiative to invest in helping Russia to destroy its huge arsenal of antiquated nuclear and chemical munitions so as to avoid having these fall into the wrong hands.
There is little except national inertia, complacency and opportunism that stands in the way of beginning to formulate and implement a distinct EU policy to bolster the coalition against terrorism.
The present crisis exposes this pattern of European behavior as what it has always been - the luxury of looking backwards.
Calls for pooling European efforts have been many, based on the conviction that only in this way can European governments play a more effective international role.
All too often, however, these have been ignored or dismissed as impractical by those in power.
They deserve a better hearing now that retaining the solidarity of their citizens has become an essential condition for European governments to maintain solidarity with America for the long struggle against international terrorism that lies ahead.
Even the Sheriff Upholds the Law
For some time now America has appeared to be intent on discarding the basic ordering instrument of relations between states - international treaties and the institutions that watch over them.
The Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) treaty with the former Soviet Union banning missile defense has been cancelled.
A protocol seeking to supervise the prohibition of biological weapons production has been rejected.
The Kyoto Protocol on climate change has been declared unacceptable to the US.
The Nuclear Test Ban Treaty - negotiated with major US involvement - has been dismissed.
The project of an international court of justice is ridiculed and resented.
Indeed, when Russia demanded that agreed limitations on nuclear strategic warheads be defined in a document binding both Moscow and Washington, the US balked, preferring a vague declaration of principle instead.
International covenants, the Bush Administration conveyed, are maybe all right for lesser powers - but they are an unacceptable restriction on the freedom of action of the world's only superpower.
It is not only America's enduring willingness to use her unique power in ways generally benign to international stability that should put fears over this trend to rest; nor the other familiar phenomenon that American administrations tend to start off with ideology before they arrive at pragmatism.
We are not witnessing a Copernican revision of the orbits of global diplomacy.
For, although a world without treaties and institutions would hurt most other countries more, it would hurt the mighty US as well.
The Guantanamo experience on how to treat Taliban and Al-Qaida fighters is a clear case in point.
In the past, the Geneva Convention prescribed how regular prisoners of war and members of irregular military forces should be treated when apprehended: they are not to be dealt with as criminals.
At first, US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld declared this international agreement inapplicable.
Soon, however, the Pentagon's language lost its sharp edge: the problem did not really exist as the captives would be released soon anyway, and were treated well anyway.
Finally, President Bush announced that Taliban fighters but not Al Qaida terrorists would enjoy the Geneva Convention's protections.
The reason for this reversal is obvious: if the US puts the Geneva Convention in doubt, American soldiers, if taken prisoner, could lose their protections.
Once the US claims the right of redefining or dismissing international treaties as it pleases, it can scarcely blame others if they do so as well.
Because it is so fragile, international law depends on the support of the most powerful participants in international affairs; if their commitment is in doubt, it will not be upheld.
But the ability of powerful nations to exercise their international influence also depends on international law being upheld.
For its military power, America depends on no one; for its influence in the world, however, the US continues to depend on the acceptance of other, lesser countries.
Were the US to opt out of international law, the strongest symbol for a more equitable international system, it would progressively lose influence.
That is the lesson of Guantanamo.
It is also the reason why the rest of the world need not worry.
The US is going through one of its phases of redefining the world, which usually ends with helping the world work.
American uneasiness about the prevailing body of international law dealing with conflicts is not entirely frivolous.
Given the new challenges of gobalized insecurity caused, at least in part, by the privatization of force, there is now an urgent task to develop international norms that are relevant to today's conditions.
Merely to insist, as some legal purists want, on the sanctity of existing agreements, is not enough; if they were adequate for past international requirements, this does not mean they are viable in a time when non-state actors are muscling into an arena hitherto monopolized by states.
So there may be a case for re-examining the Geneva Convention just as there is for looking afresh at the project to establish a permanent international criminal court.
Since America persists in rejecting the present court proposal (which has not yet entered into force), European governments, instead of sticking to it with equal obduracy, would do better to suggest an ad hoc international court to deal with Al Qaida-type culprits, perhaps attached to the Hague Tribunal now sitting in judgment over the war criminals of the Balkan Wars.
Creating such a court would demonstrate that acts of international terrorism are an affront to the international community as a whole, not merely to the US.
It could also help the Bush Administration to come up with a more convincing procedure than the one presently envisaged for honoring the President's vow to bring the perpetrators of September 11
International agreements and international law are so essential for coexistence on this crowded globe that not even the most powerful nation can do without them.
Even in politics it is foolish to oppose logic, and the simple logic of international agreements is that if one party does not honor them, neither will others.
In the debate over the Guantanamo Bay prisoners and the Geneva Convention America's realists have, once again, won out over America's ideologues.
As if to confirm that the lesson has sunk in, Secretary of State Colin Powell has just informed Russia that the US is ready, after all, to enter a binding treaty on the reduction of nuclear weapons.
The Anti-Terrorist Temptation
The ongoing Middle East crisis is not only directly relevant to that troubled region but more generally to the global "war against terror" conducted under US leadership.
While some important victories have been won in this war, for lack of US leadership one battle has already been lost - the definition of the enemy.
Terror is a shadowy enemy.
What makes it so damnably difficult to confront is the fact that it takes many forms.
True, all terrorists act criminally by taking the lives of innocent people to further some real or imagined objective.
While each has different motives, none of the causes they espouse justify their acts.
In most cases terror is local in cause, action, and motivation: ETA in Spain, the IRA in Northern Ireland, suicide bombers in Palestine, Chechen rebels, the Tamil Tigers.
In contrast, the Al Qaeda terrorists of September 11
That was an essential distinction.
The first law in strategy is to be clear about who your enemy is, to focus on him and not be deflected.
Unfortunately, the Bush Administration lost its focus.
The Middle East crisis demonstrates the disturbing consequences of this: lack of a clear US policy towards that escalating conflict has clearly been caused by target confusion.
With the help of powerful groups within the US Administration, the Israeli government succeeded in redefining America's enemy in the "war on terror" to mean not only Osama bin Laden's globally operating Al Qaeda network, but every militant group of Palestinians that resists Israel's occupation.
So American efforts to bring about a cease-fire were stillborn.
True, the intransigence of the two belligerents frustrates the intervention of most outside powers.
But where the Middle East is concerned America always has real clout.
A decisive US effort behind President Bush's initial call for the immediate withdrawal of Israeli troops from the occupied territories could have worked.
But his words, however, had lost authority.
Prime Minister Sharon replied that he was fighting America's war on terrorism.
As William Kristol, a supporter of the Sharon line and a leading conservative US commentator wrote: "You can't have a peace process in which one of the partners is a sponsor of terrorism.
Not if you are engaged in a serious war on terrorism."
Sharon is not alone in hijacking the definition of the terrorist enemy.
Wherever in today's world revolt is quashed by military oppression, the oppressors claim that they are only following America's lead.
Kristol's dogma is eagerly applied by President Putin in Russia's brutal war in Chechnya, by Uzbekistan's authoritarian regime against Islamic groups of all kinds, by India's heavy-handed operations in Kashmir.
That danger was foreseeable; failing to avoid it a costly mistake.
Not only does it tie America's Middle Eastern policy to the intransigence of Sharon and the death wish of Palestinian suicide bombers, it also weakens the international coalition against Al Qaeda.
Even powerful America cannot hunt down everyone everywhere who employs violence as a political weapon.
Nor can it maintain an international coalition of states against Al Qaeda-type terror if its members are asked to subscribe to today's wider, vaguer goal.
Local terrorism affects different states differently and divides instead of unites.
Worst of all, the US is in danger of losing control of the campaign as all those regimes and governments fighting local terrorists in America's name obscure the fight against global terrorism.
True, Al Qaeda's tentacles reach into many conflicts.
Chechen fighters and Kashmiri insurgents apparently receive financial support, weapons and training from sources linked to bin Laden's network.
This argues for targeting such support, not lumping all of these groups together.
If you throw your blanket too wide, you cannot complain about nasty bedfellows.
Instead of leading others in a coalition against your enemy, you risk being led astray by them.
In the long blockade against Napoleonic France, captains in Britain's Royal Navy would on the eve of battle drink the following toast: "Confusion to the French!"
They knew that confusion on the part of the defender offers the best chance for successful attack.
In the "war on terror," it is now the attacker who is confused.
The fight against Al Qaeda continues and must continue.
But it will now take much longer unless today's confusion is replaced by clarity.
Inspection Not Invasion
This week Hans Blix - the UN's chief weapons investigator - provided the Security Council with an interim report on the state of Iraq's compliance with all the resolutions that require it to eliminate its weapons of mass destruction.
His definitive judgement is due January 27
Far from it.
In the vital fight to slow down the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, imagine it were possible to subject a suspected violator to the most intrusive and continuous system of international inspections far beyond what any international treaty postulates.
The world would no doubt be a safer place, and the power that had helped to impose such inspections would be praised for its far-sighted statesmanship.
Such a system of inspections exist.
The country now suffering them is Iraq, the power that helped impose them is the United States.
If matters were to rest there, there would be every reason to heap praise on the statesmanship of President George W. Bush.
Without his determination, backed by a highly credible show of military force and skilful diplomacy, Iraq's military programmes would not now be exposed to a scrutiny more intense than that applied to any other would-be proliferator in the world today.
The credible threat of war has been essential to achieving this extraordinary feat.
But precisely because it is so extraordinary it is difficult to see how implementing those threats by launching a war can make any sense at all.
If in the course of inspections Iraq were exposed as having lied and cheated this would be a confirmation of the effectiveness of the inspections, scarcely a justification for military reprisals.
The best "serious consequences" of which the UN Security Council has warned should Iraq fail to comply with its obligations would be an even more intense effort to destroy its illicit weapons through continuous inspections of the country's offensive military capabilities: inspectors, not invaders.
True, it requires great skill to walk the narrow line that separates effective deterrence from reckless action.
To make a hostile country comply the threat of military action must be seen as real, the will of the power seeking to deter to follow on its threats must be clear and evident.
To give him credit, Americas President has not yet lost his balance on that narrow path.
Many of his close advisers, however, seem intent to nudge him into war, and bellicose rhetoric has so pervaded official US statements that failure to attack Iraq could be construed as a failure of presidential leadership.
If Great Powers go to war, it is generally because their leaders fear their credibility would suffer otherwise.
The war-party in Washington is gearing up to use the credibility argument in order to force the President's hand.
Yet even the most enthusiastic advocates of military action against Iraq have to admit that such steps carry considerable risks, and no expert on the region I know shares the view, popular among arm-chair orientologists, that a change of regime in Baghdad will usher in a period of peace and stability all over the Middle East.
Therefore, those wanting to stop the slide into an unnecessary and risky war must make their own argument about credibility.
They need to convey to the US President and the US public that America can indeed be proud of what it has achieved and that a war against Iraq would, moreover, throw away the immense advantage of having demonstrated that international inspections can effectively reduce the dangers of proliferation.
They should publicly laud the President's statesmanship for having given the world the most effective instrument against the spread of weapons of mass-destruction, as well as for curbing Iraqi influence in the Middle East and weakening Saddam's regime.
Mr. Bush's international credibility, they should emphasize, does not suffer through avoiding a war but gains further through controlling Iraq's hitherto covert military effort.
To give additional credence to their praise, they should leave no doubt that if war became the only option they would stand by America.
But they should also emphasize that war is not the only, and certainly not the automatic "serious consequence" to follow from Iraqi non-compliance.
Of course, some of America's allies are better suited than others to get these points across to the audience on the other side of the Atlantic.
Alas the German government, by its conduct in Chancellor Schroeder's campaign for re-election last September, maneuvered itself out of having any authority in the matter.
Fortunately there are others, in particular Tony Blair's Britain, which can carry the message that another great Englishman who still enjoys immense respect in America, Winston Churchill, summed up in these words: "Jaw-jaw is better than war-war."
Inspection is better than invasion.
NATO Must Be Saved
Whoever thought that NATO - that most successful expression of transatlantic solidarity - had found new cohesion after the divisive Iraq crisis should visit the alliance's headquarters.
True, the Istanbul summit in late June produced a veneer of harmony, and NATO headquarters is, as usual, busying itself with frequent meetings of now 26 national delegations, innumerable committees, and the mountains of printed paper it churns out.
Something essential, however, is missing: NATO's spirit.
Many, if not most, of the members no longer recognize NATO as central to their national interest.
As one high official puts it, the organization is like the old and bruised car one keeps for as long as it functions but will dump when repairs get too costly.
There is still some use to be had from the old vehicle: it leads some 6000 troops in Afghanistan, assures a fragile security in Kosovo, and may, as was decided by NATO in June, be helpful in training Iraqi forces.
NATO is still nice to have around.
But, with the exception of those who have only just joined, few governments on either side of the Atlantic seem to fear major disaster if it gently faded away.
That, not the falling-out among major allies over the Iraq War, is the cause for the deep crisis the modern world's oldest and most successful alliance now finds itself in.
The policy differences over America's Iraq adventure exacerbated the crisis, but also obscured its true cause.
This explains why neither the US, nor its opponents or supporters in Europe, ever sought a thorough discussion of the operation in the NATO Council before, during, or after the Iraq war - they realized their views were already too far apart to be reconciled.
That is also why the modest efforts now being undertaken by the alliance to assist America in trying to stabilize Iraq will not stitch NATO back together again.
To be sure, the US administration has now asked all of NATO for help, in marked contrast to its haughty claim only two years ago that NATO as such no longer mattered; not membership in the alliance, but a particular military mission, would henceforth define the coalition.
Yet, for most of the allies, this new approach is merely tactical, a sign of Yankee pragmatism when the situation demands it, not of a change of heart on the part of the Bush administration to rebuild NATO as the central plank of the transatlantic partnership.
Nor do European governments display any such urge.
Summit communiqués have become modest if wordy affairs.
Even where members have committed themselves to a joint operation, as in Afghanistan, NATO's able new Secretary General, former Dutch foreign minister Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, has to plead for a few helicopters here, a few hundred men there, like the manager of an impoverished football association trying to put together a team.
NATO's crisis of confidence and cohesion stems from the Cold War's end, not from the turbulences of the Iraq War.
The alliance can claim important achievements over the past 15 years: it helped to stabilize Europe as it enlarged to 26 members, almost double the Cold War number; it kept the Balkan conflict under control; it even accepted a role in extra-European security contingencies such as Afghanistan.
But NATO has failed the most important test, namely to ensure that its members continue to see its success as essential to their interests.
That they no longer do so is deeply disturbing.
It reflects less on the shortcomings of the organization than on the shortsightedness of its members.
True, their security from military attack is currently no longer at stake.
But NATO is more than just a defense pact.
Like no other institution, NATO embodies Atlantic cohesion, something that remains essential for any Western effort to promote a degree of international order.
NATO links Europe to the world's most powerful country and uniquely ties the United States to a common procedure of consultation and cooperation.
Moreover, it is the only organization capable of generating international military operations for the many stability-building tasks that lie ahead.
European governments, therefore, are crazy not to support NATO.
To watch it wither is at best frivolous, at worst dangerous.
Instead of blaming the Bush administration and hoping for a change of government in the US, European members need to make NATO their own concern again.
This does not imply kowtowing to every American view and whim or foregoing efforts to strengthen European defense cooperation.
It does mean undertaking to make NATO again the place where both sides of the Atlantic develop a common approach to the dangers of this world.
Unfortunately, most European governments merely shrug their shoulders when the issue is raised.
That dangerous indifference is the most serious sign of NATO's crisis.
Smiles on the Rhine
On February 23, a day after addressing America's allies in Brussels, President George W. Bush will meet German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder in the old city of Mainz on the Rhine.
After the falling-out over Bush's Iraq adventure, the two countries -- so central to the transatlantic relationship in the past -- are once again on speaking terms.
But, however welcome the return to cordiality may be, it is no more than that.
If Bush and Schroeder are now showing the world how well they get along together, it is not because they are off to a new start, but because it suits their tactical interests.
Had the American people chosen John F. Kerry over George W. Bush last November, the reunion would be seen by both sides as a new beginning, resonant with personal warmth.
But both continue to doubt that past substantive divisions can really be overcome.
Thus, the meeting in Mainz will be one of those diplomatic courtesy calls that gloss over important bilateral differences.
There will be no meeting of minds between Bush and Schroeder, because, on most key issues, their minds hold opposite views.
Consider what is potentially the most contentious issue, how to cope with Iran's nuclear program.
Germany has been determined, together with France and Britain, to get Iran to stop uranium enrichment through incentives and negotiation.
While the US has now explicitly welcomed the European initiative, it remains openly skeptical and unwilling to join, thus weakening the chances of success.
Failure would lead America to seek the UN Security Council's formal condemnation of Iran, coupled with sanctions.
Indeed, the US is already trying to soften up Iranian resistance by hinting at a possible use of force.
But there is no support in Europe for military action, and little backing for sanctions.
If the negotiations should fail, the transatlantic cleavage could once again become glaringly wide.
The divisions are no less marked in another transatlantic quarrel, this one over whether to lift the European Union's embargo on arms exports to China, imposed following the Tiananmen Square massacre 15 years ago.
Schroeder has been pushing the EU to lift the embargo, a move that now appears imminent.
But for the US, the step is seen, not without reason, as an encouragement to China in its conflict with Taiwan.
It will be interpreted as a stab in the back of US efforts to maintain stability in the region.
Nor will there be much progress on a matter dear to Berlin, namely Germany's application to enter the UN Security Council as a permanent member.
The prospect is uncertain enough as it stands that Bush may be spared the need to veto it.
But it would make an immense difference for Germany's chances if the US actively supported what is, after all, a reasonable objective of one of its most important allies.
But the Mainz meeting will not bring the two sides closer to working out a common position on any of these issues, or even to seeing the other side's point of view.
Instead, they will dwell on what is by now uncontroversial: welcoming the recent, if still fragile, progress in Israel-Palestine relations, supporting stability in post-election Iraq and Afghanistan, and extolling the transatlantic link.
The drafters of the farewell communiqué are, no doubt, already at work listing all the issues on which the two governments see eye to eye.
Bush and Schroeder will make up for the paucity of substance with a good deal of friendly banter and bonhomie before the press assembled in Mainz.
That is, of course, better than nothing.
But it amounts merely to a temporary papering over of differences, not their resolution.
Worse, there is no sign that either man is willing to speak his mind in order to signal to the other side what he will expect when the next crisis looms.
Future misunderstandings and misgivings are thus inevitable.
The welcome return to civility is not, therefore, a return to mutual trust.
After all, the test of alliance does not lie in praising agreements, but in thrashing out disagreements in a spirit of cooperation.
Neither Bush nor Schroeder seem ready for this.
If nothing else happens, the chief transatlantic partners will be no better prepared for the next crisis than they were for the last.
As Leslie Gelb, the former president of The Council on Foreign Relations in New York, recently remarked, leaders in Europe and the US have lost the habit of serious cooperation.
What could revive that habit?
Perhaps only a miracle: real progress in the Israel-Palestine conflict, which both the US and the Europeans could then claim to have helped bring about.
Common success could make both sides realize that they still have a common cause.
But that miracle will not materialize in Mainz.
Angela Merkel Meets the World
Schroeder came to power seven years ago representing a new generation whose formative experience was not the Cold War, European integration, and transatlantic friendship, but German unification and the restoration of national sovereignty.
For him and the team that took over after Helmut Kohl's 16-year reign, Germany had become a normal country, no different from other European heavyweights like France or Britain.
Indeed, one of Schroeder's first major foreign-policy experiences was the EU summit of 1999, where the leaders of France and Britain played rough with the newcomer from Berlin.
The lesson that Schroeder drew was to insist that Germany could no longer be taken for granted and would demand a role commensurate to its size and weight.
Self-assertion became the watchword of German foreign policy.
Thus, when Schroeder claimed special circumstances for Germany's failure to meet the budgetary ceilings of the European Union's Stability and Growth Pact, he seemed to be arguing that the restrictions should apply only to smaller countries, not to the big players.
When he rightly opposed America's war against Iraq, the pride of standing up to the world's only superpower was palpable.
When he established a close personal and political relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, he signaled to the world -- and to the EU's sensitive new Eastern European members -- that Germany's foreign policy would no longer be constrained by the past.
In fairness, it should be acknowledged that it was under Schroeder that Germany shed hesitations to deploy soldiers abroad.
His support for international crisis missions in Kosovo, Bosnia, or Afghanistan required considerable political courage and made Germany one of the major contributors to international stability efforts.
To have removed the issue from domestic ideological controversy ranks as a major achievement of Schroeder's tenure.
But it was also meant to convey that Germany had grown up into a proper international power.
With Merkel, the substance of Germany's foreign policy will change little, but the assertive style will be muted.
American leaders will welcome her election as proof that the estrangement in bilateral relations is over.
But that alienation already largely ended earlier this year, when the Bush administration realized that allies are good to have and that Germany is an important one.
Merkel will reintroduce the warmth that has been missing under Schroeder, but she will not become America's yes-woman.
Nor will she abandon special relations with Russia, to which every German chancellor since Adenauer has attached major importance.
But she has already made clear that Germany's neighbors to the East will have no reason not feel bypassed.
She may even want to confirm that message by making her first official trip abroad not to Paris but to Warsaw or Vilnius.
On the European project, she is as committed to integration as her predecessors have been.
She will continue to emphasize close relations with France because there is no alternative; Britain, absent from the euro zone and the Schengen border regime, remains the odd man-in of the EU.
But there will be no new initiatives on integration until leaders in the countries that rejected the Constitutional Treaty are ready for a new try.
Then Merkel will be in a key position to add weight to a new effort for moving the EU forward.
She will continue to favor the eventual admission of the Balkan states, but she has left no doubt of her opposition to full membership for Turkey, which is the major substantive change from the Schroeder era (although her government will not block the start of negotiations in early October).
In fact, there is very little Merkel has to do after her election to make her mark on foreign policy; the visible change of style will suffice, at least at first.
In any case, she will have her hands full pushing through the economic reforms for which she will be elected and which are her top priority.
There are indications that Germany is finally emerging from years of economic stagnation, not least thanks to the reforms started under Schroeder.
At home, Merkel can hope to reap the rewards.
Abroad, Merkel has no need to demonstrate that Germany is a big country in Europe; her partners are fully aware of this.
But it is also more than just a normal country: Germany remains central to holding together the two international institutions that will continue to assure its well-being, the European Union and the Atlantic alliance.
There are some indications that Merkel is more aware of this then Schroeder was.
One can only hope that this recognition will serve as her guidepost when tough decisions must be made and changes in style alone will not be enough.
Japan's Kamikaze Isolation
Why does Japan still not understand that the way it treats its history echoes across every part of Asia that Japan's military occupied in the first part of the 20th century?
Japanese reactions reveal an extraordinary degree of stubborn self-righteousness.
As Japan's government never ceases to point out, the Yasukuni shrine, built in 1869, venerates the 2.5 million Japanese who have died for their country, not just the 14 judged as war criminals after WWII.
But, while many Japanese feel (with some justification) that South Korea and, in particular, China, exploit the Yasukuni issue to reduce Japan's influence in the region and to pander to their publics' strong nationalism, they are missing the point.
Indeed, domestic politicking seems to be at least as important to Japan's leaders as to South Koreas's or China's.
Koizumi's visit to the shrine, officially presented as that of a private citizen, was intended to impress the Japanese public, regardless of its effects abroad.
But the country now is isolated, which affects the whole fabric of stability in the region.
Japan's diplomatic isolation strengthens those in the Chinese leadership who have long sought to marginalize what is economically and militarily still Asia's most powerful nation, while sucking other states in the region deeper into China's shadow.
Japan's isolation also increases its dependency on its only ally, the United States, and undermines the fragile chance of developing a framework in Asia to address future regional crises in a spirit of cooperation rather than confrontation and rivalry.
Because Japan's isolation is a matter not only for the Japanese, it must be a matter for Western policy.
The record, however, is not impressive.
The US administration, fashionably worried over China's growing regional influence, seems quite happy with a closely-tied Japan that could help balance China.
But this is obviously a shortsighted approach, for a Japan that is tied exclusively to America will lose, not gain, against China in the region, thus making the balancing act even harder.
The Europeans have no Japan policy at all, not even a shortsighted one.
Fixated on the promise of an ever growing Chinese market, they give little thought to the stability of the region.
They seem to think of the powers in the region as unconnected islands, and of their own behavior towards one as devoid of political consequence for the others.
When the European Union last year considered lifting its symbolic arms embargo against China, none of the governments driving the proposal bothered to consider that this, too, would be symbolic, sending a message all over Asia that Europe was putting its political weight behind Chinese regional policies.
Japanese demands to reconsider fell on deaf ears, and the initiative was put on ice only when US congressmen threatened economic repercussions and China increased pressure on Taiwan.
Instead of exploiting Japan as a regional aircraft carrier, as the US tries to do, or neglecting her politically, as Europeans do, both need to work out a new, strategic approach -- if possible, jointly.
The aim must be to prevent a clash of nationalisms and encourage a cooperative framework in which the region's major countries interact and develop respect for each other's interests.
Such a framework can emerge in Asia only with Japan's active involvement, not on the basis of her isolation.
Of course, Japan must lead the way.
Japan's leaders must recognize that the mindlessness with which they still treat the sensitivities of societies that suffered from Japanese imperialism in the twentieth century is as morally deaf as it is strategically damaging.
But this process of realization is more likely to succeed if Japan does not feel it stands with its back against a wall.
Friends from abroad, therefore, can assist this process by ensuring that Japan does not to feel alone.
Far from endorsing Japanese lack of sensitivity, active Western political engagement -- for its own credibility in Asia -- must convey that Japan's future depends on gaining the trust of the region.
That is not too much to ask.
After all, Japan was a political ally throughout the half-century of the Cold War.
In a part of the world where democracy is gradually advancing, Japan can point to firm democratic traditions and institutions.
Its economic clout remains formidable, and its commercial and cultural ties to the West are broad and varied.
Japan may have shied away for decades from sharing the task of maintaining international order, but a new awareness of international responsibility is steadily emerging.
For those who want a stable Asia, the interest in establishing close links with Japan should be obvious.
This should not come at the expense of similar links with others, such as China and India, but these ties must not be acquired at the price of isolating Japan.
Nato to Lebanon -- but on one condition
No international force will simply protect Israel from Hezbollah rockets while Israel continues its current strategy.
After all, the recent military escalation in the region is at least partly due to that strategy.
If an international force simply allows Ehud Olmert's government to pursue its plans further, the countries that provide troops for the international force will not only be seen as rubberstamping Israeli policy, but will also be dragged into its failure.
To criticize Israel's strategy as flawed is not to condone the acts of Hamas or Hezbollah or to deny Israel's right to self-defense.
It is merely to point out what should be obvious: Israel's efforts to find a unilateral solution to its security problems -- whether occupation, withdrawal, or separation -- have failed.
Unilateral occupation without commitment to a viable Palestinian state has produced only the intifada and suicide bombers.
Unilateral withdrawal from Gaza without the prior establishment of a local authority to maintain order has only led to renewed intervention.
And the "security fence," which was to allow for unilateral separation, may hold back suicide bombers but not modern missiles of the kind currently employed by Hezbollah.
So far, the only lesson Israel seems to have drawn from its failed strategies is that it must extend and intensify the use of unilateral force: re-invade Gaza, devastate Lebanon, and threaten Syria and, by implication, Iran, which the Israeli government hints, had a hand in orchestrating the recent crisis.
It takes little foresight, however, to predict that more force will not produce more security for Israel.
The policy, reminiscent of terrorist stratagems, of bombing civilians in order to force the hands of their leaders will only strengthen the radicals and boost their popular support.
It will not hide the fact that Israel has run out of unilateral options.
Israel has so far been unwilling to accept this fact.
Instead, its leaders hope that a robust international force in southern Lebanon will provide protection for northern Israel, leaving them with a free hand to deal unilaterally with Gaza and the West Bank, while committing the international community to Israel's failed unilateralism.
To join such an international force under these conditions would be irresponsible.
Countries that contribute troops would appear to be siding unequivocally with Israel, thereby losing all credibility with Israel's adversaries.
They would also risk being drawn into renewed Israeli operations against Hezbollah and its backers.
Most important, they would forego what may be the last chance to promote a consensual peace.
So the prior condition for setting up and joining an international force for Southern Lebanon must be that Israel renews its commitment to the "road map" and negotiations with the Palestinians for a viable Palestinian state.
With this aim in mind, it must enter into talks with democratically elected Palestinian representatives.
True, such talks will be difficult, and they may not succeed.
But that can no longer be an argument against diplomacy now that Israeli unilateralism has once again proven to be a strategic blind alley.
Only an Israel seriously willing to seek security through agreement, not one that wants to impose her security on her neighborhood by fiat, can be partner to an international effort to bring stability to Lebanon and beyond.
Of course, some countries, not least the US, would oppose making such a reversal in Israeli policy a condition of creating an international force and consensus in NATO, the EU, or the UN may not be found or, if it were to emerge, Israel might simply refuse to abide.
Both prospects would be reason enough for staying away from the project altogether.
Creating an international force for southern Lebanon makes sense only as an investment in regional peace, not as an appendix to Israel's current strategy.
Getting to "Yes" with Iran
Yet the six governments seem determined to continue with what has been their strategy so far.
Their condition for negotiating with Iran is a prior halt of its nuclear enrichment activities.
Only in exchange for Iran's permanent renunciation of enrichment will they provide major rewards -- from lifting all sanctions and trade restrictions to security guarantees.
This strategy has not worked and will not work.
Under the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) of which Iran is still a member, countries are entitled to engage in enriching uranium for civilian purposes, and Iran claims that this is all it wants.
True, Iran's total halt of its enrichment program would be welcome, not least because its government has hidden these activities for almost two decades from Treaty inspectors, suggesting other than purely civilian motives.
But the issue of enrichment has been blown up into such a symbol of national sovereignty in Iran that no government there, not only the current Achmadinejad administration, will climb down.
Indeed, when the UN Security Council formally demanded a stop to the enrichment program and imposed mild sanctions last December, Iran's defiant answer was to increase enrichment activity.
So what to do now?
The Bush administration, predictably, is pushing for new and tougher sanctions, based on an implied warning in the earlier UN Resolution, and arguing, as it did in the run-up to the invasion in Iraq, that the UN's credibility is at stake.
But the only real test of UN credibility in this conflict is whether it can succeed in restricting Iran as much as possible to a purely civilian nuclear program.
If the Security Council fails to agree on new sanctions -- which is likely, given Chinese and Russian objections -- it would be exposed as a paper tiger.
If, on the other hand, it works out a consensus on more economic and possibly even military punishment, the UN's credibility would depend on whether these moves produce Iranian compliance.
That, however, is unlikely.
Tougher economic sanctions will not force Iran to comply; instead, sanctions will merely hit this oil- and gas-rich country's trading partners.
More threats will only push the international community further along the spiral of escalation and, possibly, into military action.
There are those in Bush's entourage who would like nothing better.
While even a major air attack would fall short of destroying all of Iran's nuclear installations and, moreover, leave the technical know-how intact, it might at least slow down the program for a while and serve as a warning to other potential proliferators.
But it is a foolhardy gamble.
Today, Iran declares that it wants to observe the NPT, and that has no intention of building a nuclear bomb.
After a military attack by the United States, both promises would be history.
If the six governments want to avoid the escalation spiral and curb the proliferation dynamic, they need to change strategy and objective.
Instead of making a halt to uranium enrichment the be-all and end-all of their effort, their central objective should be to subject the Iranian activities to as much verification as possible: if Iran wants to enrich, so be it, but it must accept intrusive international inspections.
This is a bargain that the Iranians themselves have repeatedly hinted at.
The Six have refused because verification cannot provide an absolute guarantee against the diversion of some enriched uranium to military use.
But as the superpowers learned in the Cold War, the absence of airtight verification does not render inspections useless.
They would still submit the Iranian program to greater restrictions than is the case today.
And such an agreement would open the way to a wider agreement between Iran and the West for cooperation and regional stability.
That is why the Six should stop digging a deeper hole.
Instead of formulating new sanctions for the UN Security Council, they should use the next few months to explore confidentially what level of restrictions combined with verification Iran would consider in exchange for undisputed enrichment.
By all means, the Six should keep the option of more biting resolutions as an inducement to Iranian compromise.
But those who now call on the Security Council to issue rapid condemnations of Iran's behavior should keep two things in mind: they are unlikely to have any effect, and the US has already used such resolutions as a pretext for launching military action on its own.
Making Culture Count
Constitutions express a political community's history, culture, values, and political convictions.
The Constitution for Europe now being written is no different.
It cannot create the common bonds that define Europe and hold it together.
It can only reflect and be animated by them.
Today, however, the cohesive forces that held Europe together for two generations have lost some (if not all) of their strength.
Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, peace and liberty are more or less taken for granted.
Economic integration has advanced so far that a return to the national rivalries that twice led the continent into suicidal warfare is unthinkable.
The postwar search for affluence, too, has lost much of its allure.
In Germany and other member states, economic growth no longer seems certain.
Citizens are increasingly wary of the idea of economic and social progress.
Public debate instead highlights the need for restricting government activities and reducing social transfers.
Enlargement of the European Union from 15 to 25 members will mean that for decades Europeans will need to live with greater material inequalities.
To be sure, lower standards of living having always existed between Europe's east and west.
During Europe's Cold War division, that gap widened considerably.
With enlargement, those differences can no longer be hidden.
German reunification provides a sobering example in dealing with this problem.
If the enlarged EU were to attempt on a Europe-wide scale what Germany did for its eastern lands, current EU members would need to transfer roughly 4% of their combined GDP to the new member states for at least a decade.
Politics will make such transfers impossible, but even if that were not the case, the new members lack the political, economic, social, and administrative infrastructure to absorb them.
Thus, the time needed to narrow the gap between Europe's east and west will be measured in generations, not years.
If the ties that have bound Europe together for two generations are fraying, what alternative bonds can be found?
Late in his life Jean Monnet said that, were he to begin European integration again, he would start with culture.
But secularization, rationalization, and atomization of civil and social life, and the steady expansion of government into every social sphere, have lead to a privatization of culture and religion, reducing their potential to stimulate feelings of community, identity, and solidarity.
If the EU is to be durable, it must place greater emphasis on its cultural heritage.
Because of Europe's multiplicity of languages, no one language can serve as a strong element of identity.
Of course, English is developing into a lingua franca.
But as a lingua franca it is limited to serving as a technical or professional language, not the language of a community.
When it comes to real cultural identity, Europe's true "common language" is composed of its musical, literary, artistic, and architectural traditions-the cultural substance perceived by all as European.
The cultivation, constant renewal, development, and protection of this cultural identity must be a key common European task.
This common cultural substance is the foundation on which European nations and states are built.
Yet it is not produced by state action.
The state can support its development, preservation, and renewal, but cannot compel its existence.
People primarily determine the extent to which culture flourishes.
So cultural cohesion in Europe will have to grow from the bottom up.
But European individuals and civil societies find it hard to assert their autonomy in the face of the state.
The great European experiment will succeed only if Europe's citizens limit the scope of the state's claims on society and its resources, thus redefining those areas of self-government and autonomy where responsible community life and cultural activities flourish.
It is in these areas, however, that the constitutional drafts emerging in Brussels are wanting.
Consider the EU's Charter of Fundamental Rights.
Rather than limiting itself to basic human rights, the Charter dilutes them by engaging in detailed regulation of labor standards, social laws, and pronouncements that reflect industrial-age experience rather than address the future.
To promote such "rights" as fundamental will more likely perpetuate the status quo than help shape Europe's future.
In this sense, the Charter is reactionary: if it is included in the constitution, it will impede the development of rights and responsibilities appropriate to the future.
Europe's new constitution will be accepted as a guarantee of freedom and lawful government only if it results from a broad public dialogue reflecting the common cultural and moral assumptions that bind Europeans together.
If it is to last, it will not be enough for it to be conceived in the light only of today's experience.
If the Constitution is to guide Europeans through periods of change and yet unknown threats, its roots must reach the foundations of European history and identity as they are embodied in the shared culture that Europe's citizens freely acknowledge as their own.
A Foreign Policy for New and Old Europe
Watching the news from Iraq, I recall when I was Poland's Prime Minister during the Gulf War in 1991.
I watched from home on CNN as the first cruise missiles hit Baghdad.
Hours later our military informed me that armed conflict was underway in Iraq. ``Yes, I know,'' I said. ``I've been watching the bombardment on TV.''
Twelve years later, Poland's Prime Minister didn't need a belated call from his military to know that war was underway in Iraq.
All the details of the attack were provided in advance by the US, now Poland's NATO ally.
Indeed, Poland has secured a leading role in Iraq's occupation.
What a distance Poland has travelled since communism's collapse in 1989!
Little of this, however, is the result of design, for (unfortunately) we in Poland have not thought through what sort of foreign policy we need as a member of NATO and putative member of the European Union.
We remain narrowly focussed on whether an initiative will be immediately good or bad for us.
Couple this with a form of foreign policy schizophrenia--some Poles think that by ``simply existing'' we influence Europe's fate; others suffer crippling pessimism, consigning Poland to permanent ``second-class'' status--and you have a recipe for inertia.
Our attitude seems to be that somehow things will sort themselves out.
Much of Europe seems to be stuck in the same mindset: we say that we want a common foreign and security policy, but we do nothing about it until a crisis emerges.
Then we squabble about what to do.
The time for such laxity is over.
For Poland and the other countries of East-Central Europe that have or are about to join NATO, membership in the Alliance didn't really require debate.
Our histories of oppression by powerful neighbours told us that collective security within NATO was the only real option.
EU membership and the global war on terror, however, demand a more deeply considered response.
Why?
Because EU membership affects every aspect of a state, economy, and society, while the war on terror demands a completely new way to conduct diplomacy and security policy.
Today's crisis in transatlantic relations, and our accidental involvement in it as part of Donald Rumsfeld's ``New Europe,'' means that Poland (like every other European state) must now decide what it really wants from the EU and NATO.
We must consider both our attitude to global problems that were once deemed peripheral to European interests, as well what it really means to be an EU partner.
Only answers to these questions can reconcile the divide between the ``new'' and ``old'' Europe, as well as the new and old Atlantic worlds.
Poland as an ally of the US is not the real headache facing President Jacques Chirac or Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder.
Instead, the French and German leaders are really responding to the growing unpredictability of today's emerging European order.
They see new players (say, Spain) rising to shape EU policy, particularly foreign policy, and sense that their traditional leadership is being challenged.
But an EU with 10 new members simply cannot be run as it has for decades.
So the challenge to France and Germany does not arise because Poland is some sort of American ``Trojan Horse.''
Instead, the EU's structure now demands not only a new consensus about Europe's role in the world, but also new means to achieve consensus.
History cannot be put on hold as Europe sorts out its internal balance of power.
The world needs a united continent, ready to go into action.
That consensus must include the US.
During the Cold War, most Europeans tolerated America's tendency to lead unilaterally, because of the Soviet threat and the preponderance of US power.
But America is having a hard time understanding the new circumstances of the post-Cold war era.
Its difficulties are exacerbated by the dramatic disparity in military forces on either side of the Atlantic, and its belief that Europe's ambitions to become a military power will come to nothing because Europeans won't spend the money necessary to achieve that goal.
Here is where Poland can help bridge the Atlantic divide and forge a European consensus.
September 1939 taught every Pole that military power must be real to be effective.
Intentions don't deter invasions.
As Danish Premier Anders Fogh Rasmussen recently said, ``France and Germany are not in a position to guarantee our country's security.
The US is, but security does not come free of charge.''
Most Poles think that Poland's situation is akin to Denmark's.
Indeed, all of Europe is in thrall to American power.
But this dependence should not disguise the fact that there is a commonality of foreign policy interests between Europe and America.
If the EU builds its foreign and security policy on the basis of recognition of this truth, many of today's divisions will disappear.
The EU's foreign policy should be guided by the following goals:
fight terrorism;
prevent local conflict;
promote human rights and democracy;
oblige unpredictable countries to become responsible;
maintain close cooperation between Europe and the US;
help poor countries.
Polish foreign policy, like that of the EU, can only be effective in the long term if it takes realistic steps--and spends the necessary money--to realize these objectives.
They are the only possible bedrock in transatlantic relations, in an expanded Union, and in relations between the ``New'' and ``Old'' Europe.
In Defense of Polish Plumbers
Existing policies to achieve social cohesion are based on the belief that, if uncorrected, the free play of market forces will lead to wide disparities in income and thus intensify social conflict.
But studies tend to show that the majority of income transfers by government occur within the middle class, while only a relatively small proportion are from rich to poor.
In fact, some transfers flow the other way.
For example, many pension systems transfer money from the poor to the middle class, simply because richer people usually live longer.
What most European countries get for their social expenditure is a lot of state provision of services, and not much reduction in social inequality.
So lower levels of social expenditure could involve only a relatively small increase in inequality and social conflict.
Moreover, if Europeans target social expenditure better, they might achieve a greater reduction in inequality with a lower level of social transfers.
Indeed, some policies aimed at achieving cohesion may well reduce it.
Restriction on firing employees, for example, may protect people who have jobs, but often at the expense of the unemployed, thus increasing social exclusion.
Even where high levels of social transfers actually do reduce inequality (and therefore presumably increase cohesion), they may undermine inter-communal relations if ethnic minorities are perceived as being strong net beneficiaries.
The European Union resulted from the tragic lessons of the first half of the twentieth century, when giving free rein to national egoism led to continental catastrophe, and increasing globalization means that economic, internal, foreign, and defense policies are unlikely to be successful when pursued exclusively at national level.
Yet we continue to believe that social cohesion can be limited to that of the nation.
European cohesion funds account for only a fraction of a percent of European GDP, whereas about 10% of national income is typically spent on social transfers.
A massive increase in European Commission spending power to achieve greater pan-European social cohesion would be politically unacceptable to the richer members, who would have to pay for it.
But neither can we accept a situation in which vast resources are spent on national cohesion, while European cohesion lags so woefully behind.
Fortunately, inequalities can often be reduced considerably without spending much money.
Nothing that the EU or its individual members can do would have as great an impact on reducing income inequality in Europe than eliminating national protectionist barriers to migration, movement of capital, and provision of services.
Doing so would reduce inequalities not only between EU member states, but also within the poorer ones.
The poorest of the poor would gain the most, while the rich member states would lose little, despite their popular fear of open borders.
For example, during the referendum campaign in France for the European constitution, the "Polish plumber" became a symbol of the threat that European integration was supposed to pose to French workers' standards of living.
But the impact of free migration (when allowed) on French plumbers' incomes is in fact minimal, not least because of the smallness of the new member states compared to the whole of Western Europe.
Workers' incomes in Britain and Ireland have not fallen measurably, despite both countries' openness to immigration from the enlarged EU.
Free migration in the EU means that Polish plumbers will not only catch up with French plumbers, but also with Polish bankers.
Middle-class people in Poland are being hit by the increased cost of the services of skilled workers, such as plumbers, and also of the less skilled, such as decorators, and the highly skilled but low paid, such as doctors.
Why, then, was the European Commission's proposed services directive, which would ensure freedom to supply services across the Union to all EU companies, vilified as the "Frankenstein directive"?
Why was it fatally diluted by the European Parliament?
Why have demands by the EU's new member states for freer access to Western Europe's labor and services markets, and for the right to compete with "old Europe" for investment, been stigmatized as social dumping?
Why are policies that would do the most to reduce inequality in Europe being presented as anti-social?
What motivates the opponents of free service provision and labor movement in Europe is not a desire to ensure social cohesion, but a wish to maintain the status quo.
To be sure, change creates discomfort, and may even cause tension and conflict.
But the conservative attitudes underlying opposition to change are anything but "social," for they would deny the poorest of Europe's poor a chance to improve their lot.
Indeed, such attitudes are potentially disastrous.
If they came to be accepted as the guiding principles of European policy, Europe's economy would become petrified, with stagnant growth making it impossible to afford even modest levels of social transfers.
The Euro and the Dollar
PARIS: Oskar Lafontaine's resignation has only brought a brief respite to the Euro.
Its weakness will now continue.
If things keep going as they are going, the Euro will soon stand at a value of less than one euro to the dollar.
This is a threshold fraught with symbolism: within just a few short months of its birth the "strong" euro that its architects seemed to prophecy will have transformed itself into a weak euro.
All sorts of old wounds will inevitably open up if the euro falls so far so soon.
Many European inferiority complexes toward America, which the advent of the euro were supposed to banish forever, could easily reappear.
In Paris, the suggestion is growing that Washington must be made to stabilize exchange rates between the main currencies, in particular the euro/dollar exchange rate.
Replace the euro with the French franc, and the dollar with the DM, and the discussion evokes a strong feeling of déjŕ vu.
So one must now again repeat some old truths that many Europeans seem to be deliberately forgetting.
Just as the strong franc, the so-called franc fort of the 1990s, did not imply an economically strong France, a strong euro should not be equated with an powerfully growing Europe.
The exchange rate is a price, not a score in the last game of the World Cup.
Like all other prices, it must sometimes increase, sometimes decrease, according to market demands.
It is true, of course, that exchange rates are different from many other prices in that they are directly influenced by central bank policies.
As a result, the Federal Reserve Bank and the European Central Bank do possess the means to stabilize the exchange rates.
But it would be a grave mistake to embark on that course.
Stabilization of exchange rates implies an aggressive targeting of interest rates.
Intervening on the currency markets without altering interest rates - a measure economists call a "sterilized intervention" - would affect the exchange rate for a few minutes, at the most for a few days.
America's Federal Reserve Board chairman Alan Greenspan is choosing the dollar's interest rate to stand as a function of what is happening in the United States.
The ECB is choosing the euro interest rate as a function of what happens in Europe.
Both choices are good things.
So long as the two central banks behave this way and as the two regions are subjected to highly different choices (which, as a matter of fact, will be so indefinitely), American and European interest rates will each continue to evolve on different paths, and their exchange rates will keep fluctuating.
This is what is currently happening.
The risk of drifting into a recession is larger in Europe than it is in the United States.
As a result, in the coming year interest rates are far more likely to fall in Europe than they are in the United States.
The euro/dollar exchange rate mirrors this anticipated change.
A lower valuation for the euro diminishes the risk of recession in Europe.
Once again, this is good news for Europeans.
To stabilize the euro's rate at this stage would be equivalent to a European Central Bank's announcement that it prefers stabilizing the euro at a higher value to avoiding recession.
Alternatively, from the other side of the Atlantic, to keep the euro/dollar exchange where it now is would be tantamount to the Fed's declaring that, in spite of an unemployment rate as low as 4.4%, it will decrease interest rates and perhaps revive the corpse of inflation.
Both strategies would be idiotic.
Fortunately, both are unlikely to happen (never mind that I have more confidence in the Fed than in the ECB).
Therefore, the Fed and the ECB must continue to tend to their own shops and leave it to the currency markets to set the exchange rate.
Does this mean that the world's two great central banks should not only be passive, but mute? No, silence is a bad idea.
There is no need to remind ourselves that currency markets occasionally lose their cool, and that exchange rate movements are at times totally disconnected from the real economy, if not from reality itself.
Here is where central banks, in particular the ECB, can play an important role as carriers and disseminators of information.
They can indicate - in the austere language that is so much their speciality - that it is time for currency traders to come back to reality.
Can they succeed?
Alan Greenspan's attempts to talk and cajole the American stock market down to earth from what he called "irrational exuberance" are not quite reassuring on that account.
Perhaps he was too reserved, but such efforts are the responsible course for today's two great central banks.
Reform is Feasible for Russia
PARIS: Who lost Russia? Who is responsible for Russia's economic meltdown since 1990?
Are bumbling politicians guilty, or grasping oligarches, corrupt apparatchiks, the mafia, or the IMF?
Accusations and finger pointing abounds, but the facts remain obscure.
Ordinary Russians throw up their hands thinking everyone with power is tainted.
A new study by the consultants McKinsey, however, sheds some light on this question and moves the debate forward.
The goal of the study (which is available at www.mckinsey.com) was simple: to study, in detail, how ten key economic sectors are faring.
The conclusions are equally simple: in all sectors, average productivity is only at 19% of levels prevailing in the United States.
The cause of this very weak productivity is the same for all sectors: Russia's complex system of disguised subsidies, heavy regulations and price distortions protects state owned firms, whose productivity is abysmal, and hinders the development of new firms, whose productivity is a lot higher.
The study of each of these sectors allows for a better understanding of the nature of the system of subsidies.
At times, the rules of the game are transparent and still the established and incompetent triumph.
In the construction sector, for example, when bids are solicited publically and therefore should be open to all, contracts simply go to the old, established firms.
Others have to fight endlessly in order to obtain their construction permit from a myriad of government authorities, or clarify their property rights to the land they wish to build on.
Subsidies are often hidden.
Many firms would have to close shop if they purchased the oil and electricity and gas they use at prevailing market prices.
As a result, they rely on barter, using goods of little value (such as empty residential buildings) in order to pay their suppliers.
And the distortions don't stop there. To keep oil suppliers from selling their products at market prices, the government discourages petroleum exports and the development of new pipelines to the East.
These measures lead to unproductive businesses, to a lack of transparency that fosters the worst cases of abuse and corruption, and the loss of potential export revenues, which, at this stage, are invaluable for Russia's development.
What explains this systematic, almost suicidal discrimination against new businesses?
Is it the political influence of former directors of state-owned enterprises?
Is it local governments trying to avoid an increase in unemployment associated with the closing-down of large enterprises?
Is it the result of widespread corruption, where each potential entrepreneur knows that whatever profits could be made will go toward both taxes and bribes?
All these possible explanations contain grains of truth.
Yet they also imply the possibility of, if not magical, some certainly reform-oriented partial solutions to Russia's crisis.
For now, because of the relation between the different levels of government, local governments have very little to gain from an economic upswing within the areas that they administer.
Allowing local governments to have a greater say in regional economic growth, and thus benefit directly from it, would provide an incentive to promote new businesses, at least as far as they do not pose a threat to jobs in existing local firms.
Competition would thus spread outward.
Such developments would encourage putting a lid on corruption at the local level.
The McKinsey study shows how this was done in the Novgorod region.
The results are impressive and constitute a reason for hope.
Indeed, there are reforms in today's Russia that are both politically viable and economically promising.
The Dutch Jobs Miracle
Indeed, not so long ago unemployment in the Netherlands stood above 10%.
For some observers across Europe, the economic performance of the Netherlands is so surprising that they believe it a product of smoke and mirrors, or of some statistical trick.
But as with those who doubted the reality behind American economic growth five years ago, this view is also emphatically wrong.
Not only is unemployment way down in the Netherlands, but the rate of participation by the entire population in the labour market is growing sharply as well.
True, the proportion of workers who remain classified by the state as sick or invalid -- currently 12% -- remains much too high, to be frank.
But this proportion is less today than it was in the 1980s; so a higher unemployment rate is not being disguised by medical certificates.
Other disbelieving observers say that what we are seeing in the Netherlands is the effect of a shortening of the work week.
Advocates of a shorter work week as the road to full employment, indeed, often cite the Dutch example to declare victory for their arguments.
Those against a shortened work week, however, dismiss the increase in the number of jobs that results from shorter working hours as a false solution -- a crude swap of working hours for an increase in the number of workers.
Both hostile camps are wrong.
There is a significant increase in part-time work in the Netherlands, to be sure, but it is due, primarily, to a large increase in labor participation among women.
Thus part-time work does not mechanically explain the country's lower unemployment rate.
Breaking the Climate Deadlock
There is enormous good will to do so.
The new US administration is supporting strong American action.
China is setting ambitious targets for reducing energy intensity and making massive investments in renewable energy.
India has put forward its own action plan.
Europe has set a goal of cutting emissions by 30% below 1990 levels by 2020 if there is an ambitious global agreement.
Japan has published its proposals for major carbon reductions.
Across the world, commitments are forthcoming.
But practical challenges remain.
What is being asked is that global emissions be less than half their 1990 levels by 2050, having peaked before 2020.
Since emissions from the developing countries are on the whole lower than those of the developed world -- and will need to continue to rise in the short-term as they maintain economic growth and address poverty -- it has been proposed that developed countries cut emissions by at least 80% relative to 1990 by 2050, with major steps towards this goal over the next decade.
Developing countries will also need to play their part, significantly slowing and peaking emissions growth in the coming decades.
For the US, such commitments would mean cutting emissions to around one-tenth of today's per capita level, while for China it would mean creating a new low-carbon model of economic development.
For all countries, this is a major challenge -- a revolution that implies a huge shift in policy.
The good news is that if we focus on clear, practical, and achievable goals, major reductions can be made in order to ensure that, whatever the precise interim target, the world will fashion a radical new approach within a manageable timeframe.
A new report from the "Breaking the Climate Deadlock" project, a strategic partnership between my office and The Climate Group, shows how major reductions even by 2020 are achievable if we focus action on certain key technologies, deploy policies that have been proven to work, and invest now in developing those future technologies that will take time to mature.
Perhaps the most interesting fact to emerge is that fully 70% of the reductions needed by 2020 can be achieved by investing in three areas: increasing energy efficiency, reducing deforestation, and use of lower-carbon energy sources, including nuclear and renewables.
Implementing just seven proven policies -- renewable energy standards (e.g., feed-in tariffs or renewable portfolio standards); industry efficiency measures; building codes; vehicle efficiency standards; fuel carbon content standards; appliance standards, and policies for reduced emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD) -- can deliver these reductions.
All seven policies have already been successfully implemented in countries around the world, but they need scaling up.
While cap-and-trade systems or other means of pricing carbon emissions can help provide incentives for businesses to invest in low-carbon solutions, in the short term at least, these seven policy measures -- and direct action and investment by governments -- are needed to achieve the targets.
In the longer term, we also need technologies such as carbon capture and storage (CCS), expanded nuclear power, and new generations of solar energy, together with the development of technologies whose potential or even existence is still unknown.
The important thing for Copenhagen is that decisions are taken now for investments that will yield benefits later.
For example, the overwhelming majority of new power stations in China and India -- necessary to drive the industrialization that will lift hundreds of millions out of poverty -- will be coal-fired.
That is just a fact.
So developing CCS or an alternative that allows coal to become clean energy is essential for meeting the 2050 goal.
But we need to invest now, seriously and through global collaboration, so that by 2020 we are in a position to scale up CCS or be ready to deploy other alternatives.
Renaissance of nuclear power will require a big expansion of qualified scientists and engineers.
Electric vehicles will need large adjustments to infrastructure.
Smart grid systems can enable big savings in emissions, but require a plan for putting them into effect.
These measures will take time, but require investment now.
Meanwhile, in the short term, low energy lighting and efficient industrial motors may sound obvious, but we are nowhere near using them as extensively as we could.
So we know what we need to do, and we have tools available to achieve our goals.
MEF leaders can therefore have confidence in adopting the interim and long-term targets recommended by the scientific community: keeping warming to below two degrees Celsius; peaking emissions within the next decade; and at least halving global emissions by 2050 versus 1990.
Developed countries will be able to commit to reducing their emissions by 80% versus 1990 by mid-century, as many have already done, and provide the necessary financial and technology support for developing countries' adaptation and mitigation efforts.
With that support, developing countries in turn will need to design and implement "Low-Carbon Growth Plans" that significantly slow and eventually peak their emissions growth.
By making these commitments, the MEF leaders, whose countries account for more than three-quarters of global emissions, would lay a firm foundation for success in Copenhagen.
Between L'Aquila and Copenhagen, there will undoubtedly be difficult discussions over interim targets for developed countries.
While such targets are important, what matters most is agreement on the measures that ultimately will set the world on a new path to a low carbon future.
For years, the emphasis has rightly been on persuading people that there must be sufficient "will" to tackle climate change.
But leaders, struggling to cope with this challenge even amidst economic crisis, need to know that there is also "a way."
Only by combining the two will we succeed.
Fortunately, such a way -- immensely challenging but nonetheless feasible -- exists.
Reforming Employment Protection
There may be no labor market institution more controversial than employment protection regulation--the complex set of laws and procedures that govern how firms hire and fire workers.
Firms complain not only about the direct cost, but also about the complexity and the uncertainty introduced by such regulation.
They argue that regulatory constraints make it difficult for them to adjust to changes in technology and product demand, and that this in turn lowers their efficiency, raises their costs and, as a result, deters job creation.
Workers, on the other hand, focus on the pain of unemployment, and argue that such pain should be taken into account by firms when they consider closing a plant or laying off a worker.
Under pressure from firms to decrease protection, and from workers to maintain it, European governments have navigated carefully, looking for politically acceptable reforms.
In most countries, reforms have included extending the scope for temporary contracts.
This would seem like a smart solution, both politically and economically.
Politically, it maintains high protection for those workers who are already protected.
Economically, easier recourse to temporary contracts gives firms more flexibility in adjusting to changing market conditions.
But the evidence on the effects of these reforms is mixed.
The existence of two classes of workers--those on permanent versus temporary contracts--has led to an increasingly dual and unequal labor market.
Firms are typically reluctant to keep workers on when their temporary contracts end, as this would imply giving them high employment protection.
So new entrants to the labor market go through a long period of dead-end jobs and stretches of unemployment before they eventually get a stable job--not the best way to start their working life.
From a political point of view, the fact that the majority of workers remains highly protected, and that firms have more flexibility than before, decreases the pressure for coherent, across-the-board reform.
Ignore political feasibility for the moment, and ask what "good employment protection" should look like.
The answer is actually simple.
When deciding whether to lay off a worker, a firm should take into account the social costs of doing so.
This means taking into account the benefits that the unemployment insurance fund will have to pay the worker.
At least for workers with seniority in a firm, it also means taking into account the psychological costs associated with losing a long-held job.
How can such "social accounting" be done?
Again, simplicity rules.
If a firm lays off a worker, it should pay a layoff tax that is equal, at least on average, to the unemployment benefits that will be paid to the laid-off worker; to compensate for psychological costs, it should pay severance payments that increase in line with workers' seniority.
If, under these conditions, a firm decides to layoff a worker, it should be free to do so.
Simply put, if firms find it more profitable to close a job or a plant even after paying the social costs of their decision, then it does not make sense to keep that job or plant open.
How does this answer compare to the way employment protection is currently designed?
The answer varies from country to country, but the case of France is representative.
In France, unemployment contributions are collected through a payroll tax, not a layoff tax.
This means that firms that lay off more workers do not pay more.
But firms that lay off more workers should pay more.
At the same time, the judicial process is such that judges have a substantial say in deciding whether a layoff decision is justified.
This is also wrong: not only does it lead to a long, uncertain process, but there is no reason for judges to be involved in the first place.
So employment protection reform should involve a shift from a payroll tax to a layoff tax, accompanied by a reduction in the role of judges.
Judges should make sure that rules are followed, but if a firm is willing to satisfy administrative requirements, pay the layoff tax, and make severance payments, they should not be able to second guess the firm's decision.
How complicated would it be to shift from a payroll tax to a layoff tax?
Ironically, the answer comes from America, where the financing of unemployment insurance is indeed done through layoff taxes.
The generosity of the US system--and hence the burden of layoff taxes--is limited.
Benefits and taxes would be higher in Europe, but America's system indicates that it can be done.
This forces us to return to the question of whether such a reform is politically feasible.
I believe it is.
Higher layoff taxes, which force firms to think twice before laying off, would be welcomed by workers, while lighter and more predictable regulation of employment relations would surely be welcomed by firms.
The political road is narrow, but it may exist, and the economic and social rewards of finding it would be very high.
Europe's Blame Game
The European Union's leaders have just met to draw the lessons from the failed referenda on the Constitutional Treaty.
But they need not search too far for culprits; indeed, they need only look in the mirror and confront the consequences of the dishonest game that the leaders of EU member states have played for too long.
Over the years, those leaders hoped to reap the benefits of reform while avoiding the blame, so they routinely let EU officials based in Brussels take the political heat for unpopular but necessary measures. They then bitterly complained to their people about "Brussels bureaucrats" and their undemocratic ways.
But these leaders forgot that their people might actually believe them.
So, when the leaders of France and the Netherlands -- pro-constitution to a fault -- asked their people what they thought about the Union, they received a clear echo of their own message: the people did not like the reforms, and they did not like the "Brussels bureaucrats," constitution or no constitution.
Nowhere has this game of passing the blame been more visible than in the way EU governments have handled the deregulation of the product market.
The rewards to be gained by deregulating product markets are very large.
Breaking up monopolies often yields dramatically lower prices and thus higher living standards for consumers, because the same wage buys a lot more.
Consider deregulation of telecommunications and airlines, which has ushered in competition from low-cost carriers of data and people.
Deregulation also leads to economies of scale, lowering prices even further, as we all know when shopping at the hypermarket rather than the corner grocery store.
But deregulation inevitably brings disruptions.
Consumers gain, but some workers lose.
Existing firms often have a hard time adapting.
New, leaner firms take over.
In the process, old firms go bankrupt, workers are laid off.
Rents disappear, and think of the effects of airline deregulation on pilots' salaries.
Even if as many or more jobs are created as are destroyed, this does not eliminate the pain of those who find themselves unemployed.
By any estimate, with a decent safety net for workers who lose their jobs, the benefits of deregulation far exceed the costs and the pain they cause.
But this does not make governments' political task much easier, because the benefits are diffuse: consumers paying less for airline tickets may not attribute it to deregulation.
By contrast, the costs are localized: airline workers who risk losing their jobs are intensely aware of the connection between deregulation and layoffs.
Of course, governments could try to explain why they pursue deregulation.
But it is much easier for them to adopt a low profile, get the "Brussels bureaucrats" to do it, and then blame those Brussels officials, indeed the EU, for any and all of the pain.
Or could it really be true that "Brussels" has overstepped its powers, forcing more deregulation than national governments wanted?
This exonerating hypothesis does not hold water.
The case of airline deregulation is again revealing.
Twice in the last ten years, national governments have explicitly given the EU the authority to tighten constraints on their subsidies to failing airline companies.
Governments did not have to cede these powers.
But they did, and this did not prevent them for blaming "Brussels" strongly and loudly for these very constraints when their own national airlines got in trouble.
Having triggered and then witnessed the "anti-Brussels" vote, what should European governments do?
One piece of good news is that deregulation of product markets has been largely achieved, so there is less need to play the Brussels blame game.
The main item on the agenda now is to design better social insurance, in order to minimize the pain from reallocation, be it from deregulation, technological progress, or globalization.
Of course, some product-market deregulation remains necessary, especially in the service sector.
The Bolkestein directive on services played badly, but there is no question that European consumers pay too much for many services.
To take just one example, eliminating the monopoly that notaries public hold in countries like France and Italy would substantially decrease the costs of buying and selling homes, decrease the cost of housing, and make it less costly for workers to move to where the jobs are.
European governments face three choices.
They can try to stop product market reforms altogether and, by the same token, try to stop trade liberalization and globalization.
So far, no government appears to have fallen to that temptation.
They also can continue to play the blame game, letting the Union pursue reforms, while complaining about Brussels bureaucrats.
But the anxiety now being felt across the EU shows the dangers of that strategy.
Moreover, labor-market policies do not fall under the EU mandate, so national governments will be on their own, without the Brussels bureaucrats to blame.
Finally, they can help "Brussels" define and design product-market reforms, and then sell those reforms, and the EU's role in enacting them, to their voters.
If Europe's leaders are wise enough to choose this course, the fiasco of the French and Dutch referendums will prove to have been useful after all.
The ECB's Path Not Taken
Despite statements to the contrary, no central bank, including the ECB, can simply focus on inflation and ignore what happens to economic activity.
Suppose, for the sake of argument, that stabilizing prices came at the cost of a 30% unemployment rate.
Surely nobody would want that.
The ECB's defenders would say that such an outcome is purely hypothetical -- and irrelevant -- for there is no conflict between stabilizing inflation and sustaining the appropriate level of economic activity.
Price stability, according to this view, reduces uncertainty, thereby enabling firms and individuals to take the right decisions, so it is good, not bad, for economic activity.
This argument is true -- most of the time.
But when an economy faces a major adverse shock, such as a sharp increase in oil prices, then the twin goals of stabilizing inflation and maintaining economic activity conflict, and the central bank's job becomes more difficult.
Think about what stabilizing inflation means in such a context.
Firms are likely to pass the increase in energy costs on to consumers by raising their prices.
In response, workers are likely to demand higher nominal wages.
If the central bank is to avoid an inflation spiral, it must ensure that the "first round" effects of higher energy prices on inflation do not fuel such "second round" effects.
In an environment where productivity gains and wage growth are already weak, as in Europe today, persuading workers to accept a cut in real wages may be tough.
The interest-rate increase decided this week will soon appear insufficient, and will have to be followed by further hikes and a large increase in unemployment.
In order to achieve its inflation goal, the ECB may have to contract activity until workers are, in effect, beaten into submission.
Is there a better way to respond to adverse shocks?
The answer from monetary theory is an unambiguous "yes": give workers a chance to adjust to higher energy prices, allow for some pass-through of higher prices to wages over time (so that wages adjust more gradually), and make clear that inflation will return to its target range within, say, a year or two.
Such a policy will limit the increase in unemployment, at the cost of only temporarily higher inflation.
So, why is the ECB set on a tougher course?
There are three plausible reasons.
First, there has been little wage pressure so far.
So the ECB may not have to increase interest rates very much in order to contain inflation.
If this scenario plays out, the impact on economic activity and employment will be minimal.
But there are good historical grounds for thinking that it won't.
What we are seeing in Europe today is more likely to be delayed adjustment rather than passive acceptance of real wage cuts by workers and unions.
The ECB should not delude itself into thinking that a small increase in interest rates will be enough.
If and when wage pressure comes, the ECB, to remain true to its word, may be forced to increase interest rates much more than it now expects.
The second argument is that if the ECB stands firm, workers will not demand higher nominal wages, for they will understand that this would only lead to higher interest rates and higher unemployment.
This argument is not irrelevant; monetary policy probably has some effect on wage bargaining.
But one should not expect too much from a tough ECB stance.
Think of the limited success of the ECB's advocacy of greater labor-market flexibility: there has been no dramatic increase in the pace of reforms.
The third argument is that higher inflation today would endanger the ECB's credibility in the future.
This argument, too, is hardly irrelevant: higher inflation today must not be permitted to change inflation expectations in the medium run.
Leaving interest rates on hold in the face of adverse price shocks thus requires a convincing explanation by the ECB of its underlying policy.
Here, the ECB's task is all the more difficult because, having focused so narrowly on inflation stabilization, markets would read adoption of a more flexible stance as a change in position.
Moreover, because the ECB has actually exceeded its inflation target in recent years, its credibility is already in doubt.
True, adopting the appropriate policy would require the ECB to articulate its rationale with great care.
Here it can take lessons from its British and American counterparts: credibility does not require dogmatism, but rather clarity of purpose.
What is at stake is too important to ignore.
On its current policy path, unless oil prices fall, the ECB risks being forced to commit to substantially higher interest rates, and thus to a further increase in Eurozone unemployment.
How to Emerge from the Crisis in 2009
Let me first set the scene by making three observations on where we are today.
First, in the advanced countries, we have probably seen the worst of the financial crisis.
There are still land mines, from unknowable credit default swap (CDS) positions to hidden losses on balance sheets, but the worst days of frozen money markets and obscene risk spreads are probably over. 
Second, and unfortunately, the financial crisis has moved to emerging countries.
In crossing borders, the sharp portfolio reallocations and the rush to safer assets are creating not only financial but also exchange-rate crises.
Add to this the drop in output in advanced countries, and you can see how emerging countries now suffer from both higher credit costs and decreased export demand.
Third, in the advanced economies, the hit to wealth, and even more so the specter of another Great Depression, has led people and firms to curtail spending sharply.
Not only have they revised their spending plans, but, in many cases, they have delayed purchases, waiting for the uncertainty to clear.
The result has been a sharp drop in output and employment, reinforcing fears about the future, and further decreasing spending. 
Let me now turn to policy.
If my characterization of events is correct, then the right set of policies is straightforward:
First, the measures put in place earlier to repair the financial system must be refined and consolidated.
One silver lining of the worst days of the crisis in October was to scare governments into action on the financial front.
Central banks generously provided liquidity.  
But governments soon realized that the main issue was solvency.
They pledged to implement programs aimed at asset purchases (to clarify the balance sheets of financial institutions), recapitalization (to make sure that, if solvent, they could operate and continue to lend), and guarantees (to reassure depositors and some investors that their funds were safe).
The basic architecture for these measures is now in place, but the implementation has been often haphazard.
Lessons from previous banking crises around the world could have been learned faster.
The twists and turns in some of the programs, most notably in the United States, have left markets confused, and have led private investors to stay on the sidelines, waiting for policy clarification before taking a stake in financial institutions.
I have little doubt that learning by doing will eventually lead to coherent programs.
But time has been lost. 
Second, emerging market countries must get help in adjusting to the financial crisis.
It is not just a question of providing them with liquidity so that they can simply maintain their exchange rates in the face of a large capital outflows.
Many investors who want out will not return for some time, and countries must accept this fact and adjust accordingly.  
In some cases, they can do this on their own, so all that is needed is liquidity support to avoid a collapse of the exchange rate and allow for the adjustment to occur.
In other cases, the capital outflows only worsen already difficult situations.
These countries need more than liquidity; they need financial help to carry out the necessary adjustments.
Are the proper help measures in place?
Yes and no.
For a few countries, the main central banks have provided access to liquidity through swap lines.
The International Monetary Fund, for its part, has created a new liquidity facility, enabling countries that pre-qualify to apply and get funds with little or no conditionality.
For the time being, these arrangements have been sufficient.
But liquidity provision needs to be provided on a more coherent and comprehensive basis.
As for countries that need more help, this is the IMF's natural function.
A number of countries have already obtained funds under program lending.
One may reasonably worry that the available funds will be depleted before the crisis is over.
Third, governments must counteract the sharp drop in consumption and investment demand.
In the absence of strong policies, it is too easy to think of scary scenarios in which depressed output and troubles in the financial system feed on each other, leading to further large drops in output.
It is thus essential for governments to make clear that they will do everything to eliminate this downside risk.
Can they credibly do it?
The answer is yes.
With interest rates already low, the room for monetary policy is limited.
But the room for fiscal policy is wider, so governments must do two things urgently.
First, in countries in which there is fiscal space, they must announce credible fiscal expansions; we -- the IMF -- believe that, as a whole, a global fiscal expansion about 2% of world GDP is both feasible and appropriate.
Finally, and just as importantly, governments must indicate that, if conditions deteriorate, further fiscal expansion will be implemented.
Only with such a commitment will people and firms be confident that we are not headed for a repeat of the Great Depression, and start spending again. 
My strong belief is that if these policies are followed, by the end of 2009, if not sooner, the world economy will start recovering from the crisis.
Close Encounters with Recessions of the Third Kind
PARIS: Three types of recessions exist.
The first type are those caused by major shocks, say an outbreak of war or a sudden, sharp increase in the price of petroleum.
Recall that the OPEC oil shocks of the 1970's incited two world recessions.
The second category of recessions arise by chance, for example when consumer confidence dips, or businesses become uneasy and cut back on investment and/or inventory.
This was the cause of America's recession in the early 1990's.
The third type of recession occurs when imbalances in an economy build up to unsustainable levels before exploding.
This form of recession is sometimes characterized by vast increases in debt (corporate or consumer), or by dizzying stock market or capital asset speculations that eventually come crashing down.
The "popping" of such an asset bubble is what happened in Japan 10 years ago, an event from which that country has not yet recovered.
Recessions of the first type are, almost by definition, largely unpredictable.
Those of the second type are minor and relatively easy to repair if not to avoid.
All that they usually require is a reduction in interest rates or a bit of reflation.
Recessions of the third kind are the most worrying.
Is America facing this third type of recession?
What, indeed, will be the nature of America's next recession, that is, if America has a recession?
Optimists predict a recession of the second type; pessimists suspect that a third variety recession is lurking in the economic shadows.
Who is right?
The answer depends almost entirely on one single number: the growth rate of American productivity in the future.
After adjusting for inflation, America's stock exchanges roughly tripled in value in the 1990's.
Indeed, stock prices doubled compared to profits.
The savings rate for households has gone from 5% of American GDP in 1990 to zero in 2000.
America's current account balance -- the surplus of imports over exports -- is now in deficit to the tune of 3% of GDP.
Do these figures reflect alarming imbalances or are they the usual signs of a boom?
If America's rate of growth in the coming decades remains what it has been over the past thirty years, the answer is simple, and terrifying.
Stock market prices would be much too high.
Households would be behaving in a totally irresponsible manner.
The exterior imbalance would be unjustifiable, indeed, unsustainable.
If America's annual rate of improvement in productivity turns out to be higher in the next thirty years than they have been over the past three decades, the country's worries will be few.
High stock market valuations would reflect a radiant future, households would be behaving in a reasonable way, and America would be wise to run a trade deficit in order to invest.
Under such conditions, a mere nudge in interest rates by the Federal Reserve should set right any residual problem; if not, a tax cut will do the trick.
Any recession would likely be short and limited.
What level of improved productivity can America expect in future years?
Productivity growth will probably be higher than before 1995: the soaring growth rates of recent years are not accidents; the high tech explosion is real.
All the same, I still fear that improvements in productivity will turn out to be lower than the prophets of the New Economy promise.
This prospect literally gives me the shivers.
Not only may the future be less radiant, but the adjustments that will be required once reality sets in could set off a nastier recession and a more persistent slowing of the economy than anything predicted today.
Beware of Symbols
Argentina's crisis has been heating up for a long time.
So long has the country been in crisis, indeed, that the question is no longer if it may boil over, but when.
The origins of Argentina's crisis date back to decisions taken in 1991, in the fight to contain the steep inflation that marked the death throes of the military junta.
In that year, Domingo Cavallo, who already held the post of Secretary of the Treasury, took the highly symbolic decision to fix the value of the peso to the dollar through a fixed exchange rate.
Moreover, he executed this decision in another highly symbolic way, by setting the rate of exchange at one peso for one dollar.
As symbolism, this was fine.
The new ``hard'' peso marked the end of Argentina's inflationary era, a time when the country showed itself, time and again, as incapable of controlling either its budget, its currency, its inflation or its exchange rate.
This was to be the beginning of a new era, one in which a responsible, modern Argentina opened itself in a disciplined way to the United States and the world.
But, as the ancient Greeks taught, the gods destroy by granting us our wishes or fulfilling them too completely.
Without any doubt, Argentina's currency reform of a decade ago forms the roots of today's crisis.
The reason is almost obvious: Argentina is not the United States, and the peso is not the dollar.
Argentina is a little economy of the Southern hemisphere; the US is a large and diversified economy of the Northern hemisphere.
Argentina exports cows and raw materials; America exports high tech and services.
Argentina trades with Brazil, America with Japan.
Argentina must struggle to attract capital; America sucks in capital from all over the world.
For the two countries to have the same exchange rate is a crime against logic; it proved itself also a crime against Argentina.
Until 1999, everything seemed to prove Domingo Cavallo right.
Argentina's growth was fast, its inflation disappeared fast, too.
Then, the inevitable boomerang occurred: a bitter combination of shocks shattered Argentina's growth: Brazil devalued its currency, the Real, by around 50%; the cost of raw materials, prime Argentine exports, fell sharply.
All this, while the dollar was appreciating briskly, reflecting the boom of America's Clinton years.
That combination was lethal.
De facto, since 1999, growth has been negligible and Argentina has endured a thorough crisis.
This current financial crisis, which now dominates everything in Argentina, is more recent and almost tangential.
Under the influence of the recession, the budget deficit has ballooned and the creditors of Argentina's government have concluded that they would not get their money back.
In reality, the budgetary situation is not so bad: despite today's recession, Argentina's budget deficit, save for interest payments, is only about 1% of GDP.
The national debt-GDP ratio is less than 60 %, which is the average within the European Union.
Signor Cavallo, who returned to the Treasury Department in order to save his baby, is right when he asserts that the budgetary problems are simply not as awful as many people believe.
But Argentina's creditors, fearful of default, are demanding interest rates so high (around 50 % today) that there is no hope that the government can borrow at such rates.
So default no longer seems a question of ``If'' but of ``When.''
This financial crisis will probably mark the end of the Cavallo experiment, which was promoted around the world.
But the main crisis still ahead for Argentina is the economic one, which itself has lasted since 1999.
Finding a route out of it will not be easy, for no escape seems obvious: Argentina's debt is now expressed in dollars and, as in Asia in 1997, a devaluation will increase the weight of the debt.
Argentina now has just as good a chance to make things worse as to make them better.
In economics (as in most other fields of human existence), it is better to beware of symbols.
The Crisis of the Left
After a series of electoral losses around the world, the left is in crisis.
To restore it to health, some on the left argue for a return to their parties' historical roots.
Others argue that the old myths should be abandoned in favor of a bold move forward.
This debate is occurring not only in France after the defeat of the Socialists last April.
It also characterizes the political situation in the US after the defeat of the Democrats in last November's mid-term elections.
Both parties face the same dilemma, and this is precisely my point: that the crisis confronting the left is a deep, fundamental, one.
In the past, the left was equipped with its own ideology, its own economic theory.
The fundamental economic mechanism that determined how the world worked was the struggle for rents between workers and capitalists.
With this "us versus them" view of the world, it was not hard to rally voters, from the most disenfranchised all the way up to the salaried middle class--more than enough for the left to secure electoral majorities.
But the world has changed, and the left's old view simply no longer applies.
More intense competition, within and across countries, has decreased the available rents.
Financial capital can cross borders far more easily, and physical capital can relocate almost as quickly.
The limits on redistribution through the market are much tighter: trying to appropriate the rents may lead firms to move to emerging countries, or else to go bankrupt.
This reality has taken a while to sink in, and a number of parties on the left still cannot bring themselves to acknowledge the constraints imposed by market forces.
Some do, of course, none more explicitly than the UK's Labor Party, led by Tony Blair.
Others, typically old-line communist parties, have retained much of their traditional rhetoric, but this is largely for electoral consumption.
They know all too well that the old nemesis, "capital," has become difficult or impossible to expropriate, yet they remain unready or unwilling to deliver the news to their constituency.
The same tension exists within parties themselves.
Witness the muddled debate within the French Socialist party in the aftermath of its defeat, with the "left of the left" and the "right of the left" in a fight for control both of the party and the route by which it should eventually return to power.
And yet both available strategies--doing nothing or attempting to modernize--have obvious pitfalls.
The old rhetoric, after all, still resonates powerfully with the most destitute parts of the electorate: minimum wage workers, the long-term unemployed, and all those who feel that anything would be better than what they have now.
It also allows easier contact with fringe groups, such as anti-globalization protesters and the most zealous greens.
But while the old religion still mobilizes the left, it makes it difficult to hold the center.
The middle class has lost its faith in the old rhetoric, and wherever the left, by some chance, comes to power, reality quickly sinks in.
Modernization runs into the opposite problems.
Public discussion of new ways to finance retirement pension plans, or of introducing a negative income tax, sounds sweet to economists of all stripes, but it does not exactly mobilize public opinion.
The poor don't care.
The extreme left becomes disenfranchised.
The middle class likes the tone, but wonders how different the program is from what they hear from the neo-liberal right.
As the events of the French elections last spring demonstrated, when this dynamic prevails, the left loses the elections.
Shift everything I just said regarding this strategic dilemma to the right a bit and you arrive at the problems of America's Democrats.
The choice of a candidate for the next elections is about this strategic choice, not personalities.
Shift everything a bit to the left, and you arrive at the problems facing President Lula Ignacio da Silva in Brazil.
Should he return to the old Lula rhetoric and watch capital flee the country, or try "modernity" and disappoint many of those who voted for him?
With minor adjustments, the left in Germany, Italy, Spain, Portugal, and so on faces the same Hobson's choice.
So: Damned if you do; damned if you don't?
No, or at least not quite.
The fundamental feature that must distinguish the left and the right is not their respective views on the economy, but rather their stances regarding redistribution.
One of the first lessons of economics is that there is a trade-off between efficiency and redistribution.
The right focuses on efficiency.
The left emphasizes redistribution.
A clear commitment to the poor, the sick, and the unfortunate must be the message of the left.
And the means, however "boring." must be appropriate to realizing this commitment: a combination of sustainable retirement systems, better designed unemployment benefit systems, negative income taxes, training programs, and the like.
Only by employing the rhetoric of commitment to mobilize the troops while devoting careful attention to the center's concern with methods can the left hope to return to power.
Inflation targeting combines the flexibility of floating exchange rates with a strict monetary policy designed to reduce inflation and keep it low over time.
Such a regime is based on a public, formal announcement of a specific inflation target -- i.e., an annual rate, or narrow range -- to which the central bank must adhere.
Once the target is set, the central bank forecasts the future rate of inflation and compares this with its target.
Monetary policy (changes in interest rates predominantly) is then used to eliminate the gap between the two.
Developed in the early 1990s by New Zealand, such regimes were later adopted by Australia, Canada, Finland, Israel, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.
More recently it was adopted in emerging markets such as South Africa, the Czech Republic, South Korea, and Poland.
Now, an inflation targeting system is being considered by a number of other countries that adopted flexible exchange rates.
Inflation targeting is regarded as an alternative to a "monetary anchor" in which designated levels of the monetary supply are the targets (as with the German Bundesbank before the euro).
A supposed advantage of inflation targeting over targeting a particular level in the money supply is that the latter is not very transparent (the public, in general, does not pay attention to various monetary aggregates).
Nor is a targeted level in the money supply easy to calibrate due to instability in the demand for money, which is common in emerging markets.
IMF at the Crossroads
WASHINGTON, DC: I have no personal opinion on the virtues of Caio Koch-Weiser, Germany's candidate to head the International Monetary Fund.
But dithering over Michel Camdessus's replacement ought to stop.
Stanley Fischer, a brilliant, experienced economist will lead the Fund very well in the interim.
But the acting head of an organization has no mandate for change.
So Fischer, while able, is not enabled.
That is a shame, for a constellation of factors now places the IMF at a crossroads where creative leadership is needed.
Numerous suggestions for changes in its mission and modus operandi are in the air, not least the proposals of US Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers.
(America's Treasury is known to throw its weight around!)
Leadership change also creates a natural moment for organizations to take stock and ask basic questions.
Institutional inertia, always a powerful force at the Fund, is now at a cyclical low.
And what are those issues?
Here is my list:
1.
To the rescue.
How often, under what conditions, and for how long should the IMF offer financial assistance to distressed nations?
This hot-button issue is the part of the Summers' proposal that receives the most attention.
His answers are, basically: less often, only in emergencies or crises that pose systemic risk, and for short periods of time.
In the abstract, these are reasonable guidelines.
But what would they mean in practice?
Start with the term "emergency."
Surely, anything can be construed as an emergency.
So ask yourself this question: which IMF intervention in the 1990s would have been ruled out by this principle?
Furthermore, do we really want to eliminate the possibility of lending to stave off a collapse before it occurs?
I think not.
Then there is the concept of systemic risk, which is not only in the eye of the beholder but may be impossible to predict.
The Mexican crisis of 1994-1995 was seen as a systemic risk from Washington, but not from most European capitals.
Americans thought the Europeans parochial; they thought the US unduly influenced by its 2000 mile border with Mexico.
Everyone agrees that Ecuador posed no systemic risk (though it was an emergency!), but what about Brazil?
And who before July 1998 thought that a Russian default would trigger global financial panic?
So, other than keeping the financing period short, there is less to this notion than meets the eye.
2.
Fixed or floating?
The IMF originated as the policeman for the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates.
In my view, it needs not only to shun its traditional role as defender of pegged rates but actively to support (dirty) floating rates for most nations.
Not everyone agrees.
Currency boards and even dollarization are both now in vogue.
It seems to me that exchange-rate arrangements pose a first-order question which the Fund must address.
3.
Too much austerity?
I think these critics have a valid point, and the IMF should mend its ways.
There are a time and place for tighter budgets and higher interest rates, especially when monetization of large government budget deficits fuels inflation.
But the time is not all the time; the place is not everywhere.
4.
Who are the clients?
When the IMF rescue squad rushes to help a distressed nation, whom are they there to protect?
Local governments and/or financial institutions?
Western creditors?
My suggested answer is different: the millions of innocent bystanders who played no role in creating a financial house of cards but who suffer when it falls.
It has been argued that the IMF should take a more narrow financial focus, not seek to be a supranational welfare agency.
The latter role, it is argued, is best left to the World Bank.
I can't get excited about this division-of-labor issue.
The important thing is to make sure that someone assumes this role; if the IMF drops it, the World Bank must pick it up.
Furthermore, even "strictly financial" decisions can have major consequences for social welfare -- consequences the IMF must not forget.
5.
Fast or slow?
As late as the fall of 1997 -- after Asia's crisis already began! -- the IMF and the US Treasury were still pushing all countries to open up their markets to international capital flows as quickly as possible.
Lately, a new consensus seems to be developing: that emerging-market countries should proceed cautiously with capital market liberalization until they have more of the prerequisites -- sound banking systems, proper supervisory structures, and reasonable and transparent accounting and reporting systems -- in place.
Is "go slow" or "go fast" now the IMF's position on this crucial issue?
Japan Isn't Doomed
TOKYO/STOCKHOLM: Pessimism about Japan is easy and pervasive nowadays.
Its financial crisis drags on, growth is nil, unemployment rises, and, recently, deflation appeared.
Is there any way out?
For a Swede, Japan's economic problems are a form of déjŕ vu.
In 1992, Swedes accepted that their "Swedish Model" didn't work.
This was hard to understand, because everything had gone so well in Sweden for so long.
With an economy falling apart and a bankrupt financial sector, radical reforms were needed.
Change began in banking.
Sweden's experience suggests that Japan's most urgent problem is its financial crisis.
As in Sweden 8 years ago, there is too much bad debt and too many banks.
Insolvency in the financial sector spills into other sectors in the form of a credit crunch, because Japanese banks are unwilling to lend money.
This type of financial crisis is not unique to Japan.
Countries where land and stock prices rose and fell dramatically also experienced similar crisis.
America in the 1930's and 1980's had banking crisis of this sort which had real economic effects.
So, also, Sweden in the early 1990s.
Sweden's crisis is a case for Japan to study, not only because it was similar, but also because Sweden solved it.
Just as Japan has done, Sweden's government took over most bad loans from private banks so that they could begin operating more normally.
In contrast to Japan, however, Sweden simultaneously restructured the entire banking sector by closing down inefficient banks.
Restructuring was crucial to revitalizing Sweden's financial sector, and is necessary in Japan.
Quick, forceful restructuring will help end the credit crunch and lay the base for renewed growth.
Longer term, a closer look at Japanese demographic trends is crucial.
Japan recently achieved the longest life expectancy of all countries.
One-third of Japanese will be over 65 years of age in 2040, double 1995's level.
Simultaneously, fertility rates dropped to 1.4 per woman.
These demographic influences will incite severe labor shortages early in the 21st century, just when an aging population places severe pressure on health and welfare facilities.
Japan will likely experience a slowing in its traditionally high savings rate as its population ages.
This implies a dramatic slowdown in investment and long-term growth rates unless offsetting increases in productivity emerge.
Throughout history, however, Japan confronted big challenges by restructuring its culture and economy.
To revitalize Japan's economy in the long run, three big adjustments are necessary.
Liberalization of labor markets and greater inclusion of women in the workforce must occur.
Conventional wisdom says that low unemployment and job turnover rates, attributable to a system of ‘life-time employment' and worker devotion to their firms, contributed to Japan's rapid postwar growth.
Firms invested heavily in worker education, which focused on providing broad exposure to manufacturing activities, increasing productivity, and firm-specific innovations.
The need for narrowly specialized firm-specific workers is disappearing as service sectors like telecommunications, computers, software, and finance expand.
So the need for broad-based, firm-specific worker training in manufacturing will shrink.
In response to increasing labor shortages, the 21st century will bring new roles for Japanese women.
Women have traditionally been underutilized given their education levels.
While the increase in women in the labor force has recently been rapid, female employment is only 50% in Japan (relative to almost 80% amongst men).
A second structural adjustment concerns regulatory reform.
Japan's economy has been marked by high government involvement and regulation in most industries.
Japan's postwar development strategy relied on a public-private partnership.
The government sought to modernize the economic base by selecting and nurturing promising industries - limiting competition, supporting research and development and technology transfers, and encouraging the extension of credit.
Industries with potential to achieve economies of scale and scope were most favored and permitted to form horizontal and vertical cartels that cooperated on pricing, R&D, production, etc.
The government also protected special interests, such as rice farmers and small retailers, against competition through a complex system of licensing, regulation, and quality controls.
Close partnership between business and government is in direct contrast to the western, particularly the American, model grounded in strong antitrust policy, competition, and private ownership.
Japan viewed this approach as wasteful, with firms using real resources to drive others out of business or duplicate R&D costs.
In the face of a stagnant economy and an integrated global economy, Japan is under increasing pressure to modify its regulatory framework and promote competition.
Japan's regulatory environment must converge toward the industrial policies of other advanced nations.
This has been the case across Europe during the 1980s and 1990s.
These reforms will create new markets, stimulate competition, attract foreign investment and technology transfers, and improve consumer interests.
Finally, global economic conditions will compel even more restructuring upon Japan.
Japan has committed to further liberalization of its markets under the WTO.
While export expansion delivered growth in this century, import substitution and inward foreign direct investment (FDI) will lead to increasing productivity in Japan in the next.
Imports inspire a more competitive domestic business environment. As import barriers fall and as Japan's distribution systems become more transparent, converging to OECD standards, the import share of Japan's GDP will rise, improving domestic productivity.
Deregulation and greater openness, moreover, will generate inward FDI.
Competitive pressure from such investment, like import competition, will improve productivity.
In Sweden we say "it is darkest before you see light at the end of the tunnel".
Japan's crisis may look hopeless, but don't forget that this is not the first time Japan has faced such a challenge.
If Sweden solved its crisis, so too can Japan, where much of the basis for a prosperous future exists.
Only a few structural changes are needed to get Japan's growth machine working again.
Of course, the worldwide crash of high-tech stocks in 2000 chilled the hype about a "new economy" that seemed to be emerging at the "end of history."
But falling share prices should not blind us to the fact that on top of the ongoing information revolution, three fresh waves of revolutionary technology are poised to hit: bio-technology (including new medical technologies and genetic engineering, such as the creation of human embryos through cloning), nanotechnology, and robotics.
Each is its own industrial revolution, and will profoundly alter our lives and ways of thinking.
Indeed, the revolution is already upon us.
For the first time in history, a global techno-market order is transforming the world of finance, business, politics and, indeed, physiology, beyond recognition.
This new techno-market system is shaped and characterized by a belief in the increasing importance of knowledge, new ideas, innovations and new technologies, and a higher pace of what the economist Joseph Schumpeter famously called "creative destruction."
As a result, corporate capitalism is rapidly becoming obsolete, replaced by a creative capitalism in which entrepreneurship, combined with a greater willingness to adopt innovations, transforms the business landscape.
Innovative start-up firms become huge companies faster than ever before.
But these infant giants are quickly threatened with eclipse by even newer enterprises.
Take the example of computers.
It took 15 years for other countries to compete successfully with America's Silicon Valley in semi-conductors, but less than five years in Internet technology.
This system provides unprecedented financial incentives to scientists and entrepreneurs to aggressively develop new technologies and thus become rich.
just witnessing a simple adaptation of social structures and ways of living to suit new technologies.
These changes are also triggering changes in human consciousness.
The result is a litany of "post-utopian" values that include a stronger emphasis on individual freedom and personal responsibility.
In this world without utopia, individual freedom is the supreme value.
Old Europe, Young World
The EU's first 50 years were characterized by a growing population and a high proportion of working-age people relative to children and the elderly.
The post-war "baby boom" generation drove a period of sustained economic growth that strengthened Europe's standing in the world and led to dramatic improvements in its citizens' quality of life.
The EU's next five decades, on the other hand, will see the baby boomers moving into retirement, leaving a shrunken labor force with the heavy burden of supporting their elders' health care and pension needs.
Thirty-six per cent of Europeans will be aged 60 or over by 2050, and, despite increasing life expectancy, continued low fertility will mean the continent's population will begin to dwindle by 2020.
Although Europe is unlikely to become poorer as a consequence of this demographic shift, it may experience a prolonged period of slower growth.
All else being equal, per capita incomes and productivity in countries with high proportions of elderly people tend to grow more slowly than in younger countries.
Europe's economic strength relative to the rest of the world may therefore diminish, perhaps sharply.
Just as Europe's population is aging and will be shrinking, that of much of the developing world is young and growing.
By 2050 the population of the 50 least developed countries is projected to double, and while the ratio of working-age to non-working-age people in Europe will fall to around 1.4, in the developing world it will be considerably higher.
Countries in most developing regions, such as Latin America, North Africa, the Middle East, and much of Asia, may be able to absorb their armies of potential workers into productive employment and benefit appreciably from the ensuing economic boost.
(Indeed, this "miracle" has already occurred in East Asia.)
As a result, these regions' share of the global economy would increase.
Other regions, however, are likely to be unable to provide productive employment.
Swollen cohorts of young, underemployed people may cause an increase in crime and civil unrest.
Political instability, war, and terrorism could result, with dire effects both at home and abroad, including in Europe.
Sub-Saharan Africa's demographic prospects look particularly bleak, as mushrooming populations of young people move into labor markets that cannot accommodate them.
Migration from Africa and other developing regions to Europe is already increasing; as populations in poor countries grow, the number of would-be migrants will multiply.
These migration pressures present a potential solution to Europe's labor-market problem.
Europe needs working-age people to reduce the burden of a burgeoning elderly population, so relaxing immigration restrictions could help.
But this might bring with it social problems, as Europeans resist an influx of foreigners, owing to fears about jobs, security, or cultural differences.
Opening the door to migrants would have to be a gradual and controlled process, with determined efforts made to convince Europeans of its benefits.
Moreover, given the massive increase in migration that would be needed to offset the impact of population aging in Europe, this would be only a partial solution at best.
But Europe can take other steps to redress or adapt to the looming demographic imbalance.
Many countries in the region already have policies aimed at increasing the birth rate.
Tax benefits and monthly allowances for couples with children and reduced support for contraception are among the most common means of encouraging increased fertility.
In many EU countries, a much higher percentage of men than women are in the labor force.
Measures aimed at enabling mothers to work, such as state-funded childcare and more flexible working hours, create incentives for childrearing while expanding the labor force.
However, the effects of such measures are unlikely to be felt soon, so policies will also need to be directed at those already in the labor force, to encourage them to save more for retirement, and at those on the point of leaving it.
Existing pension systems often penalize people who wish to work beyond the official retirement age, and age discrimination impedes many who are capable of working into their sixties and seventies.
More flexible pension arrangements, legal reforms, and media and education campaigns aimed at shifting employers' perceptions of older workers will allow individuals to keep working for longer.
Encouraging lifelong learning will help people adapt their skills and knowledge to the demands of a changing economy.
And with higher life expectancy, raising the retirement age is a further sensible way to address the negative effects of an aging population.
A combination of these and other measures would help Europe to sustain its high living standards in the coming decades.
Recognition of the growing power of regions with more favorable demographic structures, for example, will encourage political and economic alliances that help the EU preserve its own global status.
Likewise, efforts to help developing countries create jobs and improve quality of life will reduce irregular migration and help avert its social costs.
Population change happens slowly, but its effects can be forecast early.
If EU countries are to overcome the demographic challenges of the next half-century, they should not delay in preparing for them.
European Expansion or Putin Expansion?
The Wall's collapse in 1989 forced European Commission officials to dust off atlases to find places about which they knew little and cared less.
Leon Brittan, then a commissioner and supporter of enlargement, recalls that some officials and countries even hoped that the pre-1989 line could be held.
They felt that enlargement even to the Scandinavian and Alpine countries was going too far.
Only in 1993 did the EU officially recognize that membership for all the former Soviet bloc countries could be a long-term goal.
Today, the debate about Europe's frontiers is not confined to officials or think tanks.
In mid-2005, voters in France and the Netherlands rejected the EU's draft constitutional treaty, partly motivated by fear that enlargement was going too fast and too far. "We don't want the Romanians deciding on how we should order our lives," a Dutch professor complained.
Many former Soviet Republics with EU aspirations have become victims of this loss of nerve, as have the Western Balkan countries.
Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia, which were annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940, slipped in under the wire in 2004.
But they were small and contiguous to the EU.
Ukraine is big, and Georgia is far away in the Caucasus.
Then there is Belarus, whose ruler, Alexander Lukashenko, clings to authoritarian rule.
Ukraine, a country of 47 million people, has seen itself as a prospective EU candidate since 2004, when the Orange Revolution forced the country's rulers to respect election rules.
Since then, another two free and fair national elections have been held.
In contrast to Russia, Ukrainian politicians like President Viktor Yushchenko and Prime Minister Yuliya Tymoshenko have shown that they are keen to break with the communist past.
Moreover, Ukraine's business leaders, aware of the fate of Russia's oligarchs under Putin, see EU membership as a way of legitimizing their wealth and fending off Russian rivals.
Ukraine's business barons want not only to develop their empires within the safety of a legitimate free-market framework, but also to invest in the EU.
But, while Ukraine's political elites have mastered the art of getting democratically elected, effective governance eludes them.
Russian influence remains strong, especially in eastern Ukraine, and the state apparatus is weak.
Ukraine needs the discipline of the accession process -- and thus the promise of EU membership -- if reforms are to be implemented effectively.
Belarus is different.
Most of its 10 million people are still so scared of the free market that they are ready to ignore democratic opposition to Lukashenko.
That will hold true as long as cheap energy from Russia acts as a de facto economic subsidy.
But that time is ending, with energy prices rising and the Belarusian economy facing shocks that could provoke unrest and pose a threat to Lukashenko.
Lukashenko, sensing the danger, has been making overtures to the EU to counter what he sees as a growing rift with the Kremlin.
And Belarus's government has been exploring the possibility of securing oil supplies through Ukraine should Russia cut off supplies.
But Lukashenko has given no sign that he is willing to democratize his regime, let alone release political prisoners.
If the EU decides to leave in abeyance the possibility that Ukraine and Belarus might one day join, both will enter a political limbo that could threaten security on the EU's eastern flank.
The EU's failure to encourage Ukraine's European aspirations risks creating disillusion with the West.
That would strengthen Russia's position in Ukraine, where the Kremlin constantly encourages a return to Slavic roots and warns against flirting with a West that doesn't want it.
Should Lukashenko's regime falter, the democratic opposition could be strengthened by the promise of EU support.
Otherwise, it is just as likely that Russia would step in and use its proxies to install Putin-style authoritarianism.
Since the USSR's collapse, a new generation has come of age throughout the region.
Young people in the EU's new members feel themselves to be citizens of a prosperous and secure continent.
In Poland last autumn, younger voters helped to replace a government whose incipient authoritarianism and xenophobic attitudes threatened to isolate their country.
Further east, their contemporaries have also grown up in a post-Soviet world.
In Ukraine's Orange Revolution, it was mostly young people who rejected a return to the past.
But as hopes of integration with the West wane, so a feeling of exclusion is growing.
The danger is that this will fuel support among the young in Belarus and Ukraine for the authoritarian attitudes now ascendant in Putin's Russia.
At stake in the debate about EU enlargement into the post-Soviet east is whether Western values will take root in those countries or whether they will drift into a gray zone from which they will sooner or later challenge the values and democratic ways of "Europe."
The Dutch professor who fears that Romanians may start to order his life might reflect that Romania itself is changing as a result of EU membership.
Refusing to countenance a fresh eastward enlargement means that, at some point, those countries that are outside the EU will start to threaten the values that he holds dear.
Saving the Stability Pact from Itself
At their meeting in Scheveningen, the Netherlands, the EU's economic ministers (Ecofin) once again confronted the need to reform the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP).
The issues surrounding reform remain controversial and unsettled, but this time, the ministers laid their cards on the table.
The SGP's fundamental problem is that it must strike a balance between two contradictory goals: it must retain bite against excessive debt accumulation, yet it must also give governments more maneuvering room to enact structural reforms and restore Europe's competitiveness.
As it stands, the SGP is an obstacle to such reforms.
European leaders waste political energy and capital to meet demanding budget targets, while nothing is done to address the really vital challenges: aging populations, high tax burdens, declining competitiveness.
The reason is that structural reforms tend to pay off in the long term, but cost money in the short term.
The SGP originally aimed to protect European citizens from myopic governments, but it has ended up forcing even more myopic behavior.
Take pension reform, which aims to reduce the scope of state-run, pay-as-you-go systems and expand private, fully funded schemes.
This requires cutting compulsory contributions to the public system, while maintaining benefit levels for current retirees.
The result is a temporary increase in budget deficits; the fiscal benefits appear only when private schemes start taking over pension liabilities from the state-run systems.
But the SGP's current rules discourage this kind of reform by prohibiting temporary increases in the budget deficit - even if they promise long-term fiscal consolidation.
European policymakers are becoming aware of the problem.
Some EU countries - particularly new members in Central and Eastern Europe - have committed themselves to use privatization receipts to finance pension reform.
But even this may not be enough to cover the cost.
To overcome the SGP's bias against structural reforms, the European Commission asked at this last Ecofin meeting for more discretion and to put more emphasis on (explicit) debt: countries with a lower debt-to-GDP ratio would have greater freedom in fiscal policy.
Economic ministers suggested that pension reform and long-term fiscal sustainability should also guide country evaluations under the SGP, while some countries insisted that it should be linked to the Lisbon agenda.
This would give more flexibility on budget deficits to countries that are making progress towards meeting the agenda's reform targets.
Some of these innovations would be useful.
But they risk giving too much discretion to the Commission or to future European Council decisions.
The rules-based approach of the SGP is fundamentally sound, but it requires operational criteria that can be defined with some precision.
Otherwise, the rules become unenforceable.
Consider the proposal to link the SGP to the Lisbon agenda, which contains more than 100 indicators.
What happens if a country makes progress in one dimension, but regresses in another dimension?
Inevitably, the Commission would have to decide the relevance of the different indicators - thus intervening in the national policymaking process with no political legitimacy.
At the same time, if so much unchecked discretion was left to the Council, rather than to the Commission, "peer pressure" to restore budget balance might easily turn into "peer protection."
So, can the SGP be made to work in favor, rather than against, structural reforms, without abandoning the rules-based approach of the SGP?
We think so.
The key is to select some comprehensive but operationally precise indicators of structural reforms, and then apply the same idea suggested by the Commission for public debt: countries that are making more progress on these indicators can get more leeway on their budget deficit.
An obvious indicator that would meet this purpose is the implicit debt of public pension systems - i.e., the present discounted value of all future pension expenditures under existing legislation.
Future deficits could, in theory, be reduced through higher contributions, but social security contributions are already far too high in Europe, inhibiting job creation and economic growth.
The only way to restore growth without compromising the future is through pension reform that reduces future outlays from the state-run system.
Of course, any estimate of the implicit pension debt requires caveats and arbitrary assumptions.
But so does the SGP's current implementation - for example, in the conventions that define how budget deficit are measured and what qualifies as government revenue.
Moreover, the Commission has already worked to harmonize the assumptions needed to forecast public pension outlays and achieve cross-country comparability.
Finally, to strengthen cross-country comparability further, the benchmark should be variations in the stock of pension debt under given economic and demographic assumptions, rather than the debt level itself.
There is also a more fundamental reason to focus on future variations in the stock of pension debt associated with pension reforms: the EU has no business interfering with pension liabilities of individual member states.
Why should the rest of Europe care if, say, Spain preserves a generous pension system?
The extra focus on implicit pension debts would also help to inform citizens.
Surveys reveal that most European citizens are not fully aware of the extent of intergenerational redistribution.
Many even believe that their contributions accrue to an individual, capitalized, account, rather than financing the benefits paid to current pensioners.
The good news is that these surveys (
The Immigration Game
Green Papers, as they are called in Europe, or White Papers, as they are known in America and Britain, are often mere rhetorical essays -- government-backed studies that state broad principles unlikely ever to be applied in practice.
The recent Green Paper released by the European Commission on international migration is no exception.
Indeed, the Paper is a hodgepodge of illogic and half-baked ideas that aims at "launching a public debate" on the issue, "choosing a bottom-up, rather than a top-down approach."
But while the objective is to "harmonize policies towards economic migrants across the EU," the Paper states at the outset that decisions on this matter should remain solely under the jurisdiction of national governments.
Some of the rules that it proposes are unenforceable -- and thus merely a source of red tape for migrants and their employers that would require huge public bureaucracies to administer.
Co-ordination of national migration policies will remain a dream if decisions continue to be kept under the exclusive responsibility of national governments.
There is no sign in the EU that national regulations on economic migration are converging.
Policies on migrants are becoming increasingly tough, especially in those countries that already had the most restrictive provisions.
Since 1995, there were 26 reforms of migration policies in the EU-15: two-thirds tightened regulations by increasing procedural obstacles faced by visa applicants, reducing the duration of work permits, or making family reunification more difficult.
Countries are getting tougher because migration flows can be diverted across jurisdictions.
This raises concerns among public opinion that migrants rejected by some countries could flood those that do not impose tighter restrictions.
Cross-national policy spillovers are frequent.
Finland tightened its immigration regulations in 2004, following closely the restrictive stance taken by Denmark in 2002.
Portugal adopted more restrictive provisions in 2001, after Spain implemented a similar reform in 2000.
Ireland did the same in 1999, after the UK enacted two reforms in 1996 and 1998 designed to curb immigration.
This race to restrict pervaded decision-making on transitional arrangements following accession of 10 new members -- eight of them postcommunist countries -- to the EU last May.
Twelve of the 15 countries reneged on promises not to restrict worker flows from the new members as they realized that Austria and Germany were closing their borders to immigration from their eastern neighbors.
But tight national restrictions do not seem to prevent migration; they only alter the geographical orientation of flows and fuel increases in illegal immigration, thereby inflating the size of the informal economy.
Indeed, illegal immigration is larger when restrictions to legal migration are tight.
Illegal flows as a proportion of the population are about 25% larger in Europe than in the US; at the same time, legal flows are roughly 25% larger in the US than in Europe.
The US also has more realistic migration restrictions than most European countries.
Realistic restrictions in Europe can be adopted only by taking into account migration spillovers across jurisdictions, which requires implementing policies that are agreed at the EU level.
But national governments remain reluctant to delegate authority: in November 2004, the European Council accepted qualified majority voting on measures concerning illegal migration, but left restrictions on legal migration subject to unanimity rules, as if legal and illegal migration were not merely two sides of the same coin.
The Green Paper will not make EU leaders change their minds.
It states that national governments can better "respond to the specific needs of their labor markets."
It does not stress the obvious advantages of having the EU as a unique player in enforcing border controls, signing cooperation agreements with migrants' countries of origin, and encouraging the type of flows that are best suited for Europe.
The Green Paper also suggests that, when admitting migrants, member countries "require proof that no one already part of the domestic labor market can fill the vacancy concerned."
It is unlikely that this would be possible even under central planning.
Migrants change jobs twice a year on average, as they "grease the wheels" of European labor markets with their mobility from less to more productive jobs.
Should we prevent them from doing so?
Similarly, the Paper proposes that the self-employed should be admitted after an evaluation of their business plans.
In Milan this year, more foreigners than Italians registered as self-employed.
Who will examine their business plans?
Even if the Paper's suggestion were plausible, which it is not, it begs a larger question: should we prevent migrants from taking entrepreneurial risks?
If taken seriously, these rules will accomplish nothing, except to force migrants and their prospective employers to find other ways to each other.
The European Commission's Green Paper on immigration looks like an invitation to join the underground economy.
The Geopolitics of Football
Is there a relationship between football (and sports in general) and a spirit of nationalism and militarism?
During the Middle Ages, sports were regularly forbidden in England because they came at the expense of military training.
After France's defeat by Bismarck's Germany in the Franco-Prussian War, Baron Pierre de Coubertin (who re-launched the Olympic Games a few decades later) recommended a renewed national emphasis on sport, which by this point was seen as a form of military preparation.
In a football match, the rituals -- the flag waving, the national anthems, the collective chants -- and the language that is employed (the match starts with a "breakout of hostilities," one "bombs" the goal, blows up the defense, launches "missile") reinforce the perception of war by other means.
And, in fact, real war has actually broken out over football.
In 1969, Honduras and Salvador clashed after a qualification game for the World Cup.
Football matches can, it seems, revive national rivalries and conjure the ghosts of past wars.
During the 2004 Asia Nations Cup final, which pitted China against Japan, Chinese supporters wore 1930's-style Japanese military uniforms to express their hostility to the Japanese team.
Other Chinese fans brandished placards with the number "300,000" written on it, a reference to the number of Chinese murdered by the Japanese army in 1937.
But can one really say that football is responsible for the currently bad diplomatic relations between China and Japan?
Of course not.
Hostility on the football pitch merely reflects the existing tense relations between the two countries, which carry the weight of a painful history.
At the opposite end of the spectrum, the dramatic semi-final between France and Germany in Seville in 1982 produced no political ripples, either for diplomatic relations between the two countries or for relations between the two peoples.
Antagonism was confined to the stadium, and ended when the match did.
What football really provides is a residual area of confrontation that allows for the controlled expression of animosity, leaving the most important areas of interaction between countries unaffected.
France and Germany will soon have a common army -- they already have a common currency -- yet the survival of national teams channels, within a strictly limited framework, lingering rivalry between the two countries.
Football can also be the occasion of positive gestures.
The joint organization of the 2002 World Cup by Japan and South Korea helped accelerate bilateral reconciliation.
The performance of the South Korean players was even applauded in North Korea.
Sport, indeed, seems to be the best barometer of relations between the divided Korean people.
Moreover, football, more than long speeches or international resolutions, can help induce progress towards peaceful solutions for military conflicts.
After their qualification for this year's World Cup, the Ivory Coast's national team, including players from the north and south, addressed all of their fellow citizens, asking the warring factions to lay down their weapons and to put an end to the conflict that has shattered their country.
After Haiti's President Jean-Bertrand Aristide was overthrown a few years ago, Brazil's football team acted as an ambassador for the United Nations' Brazilian-led peacekeeping forces.
And, when conflict stops, from Kosovo to Kabul, football is the first sign of a society returning to normal.
The former president of the FIFA, Joao Havelange, often dreamed of a football match between Israelis and Palestinians: the American vice-president Al Gore regarded such a match as a means to help Washington solve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
Perhaps one day it will take place.
Certainly the Iran-United States football game in 1998 offered a moment of fraternization between the two teams.
Another Iran-US match might be helpful at this difficult time.
It is because football allows for symbolically limited confrontations, with no major political risks, that it is useful.
Its impact on national and international public opinion is broad, but not deep.
As the sociologist Norbert Elias put it: "The spectators of a football match can enjoy the mythical excitement of battles taking place in the stadium, and they know that neither the players nor they will suffer any harm."
As in real life, fans can be torn between their hopes for victory and their fear of defeat.
But in football, the elimination of an adversary is always temporary.
A return match is always possible.
As a Frenchman, I cannot wait for the next World Cup match between France and Germany.
But I want France to avenge its defeat at the last World Cup in Seville, not its defeat at Verdun.
The Tragedy of Zidane
Whatever the provocation that led to Zidane's behavior (probably a racial comment), his violent act, seen around the world, has tarnished his image.
The sad paradox is that while the world had been learning of and celebrating his legendary kindness as a person, he will now be distinguished for all time by an act of aggression.
Indeed, Zidane's status as an emblematic champion of the world's most universal and popular sport does not fully explain why people have been so obsessed with him.
His human qualities, as much as his talent and technical feats on the field, counted equally in establishing his popular acclaim.
Football has always been this way.
For Argentineans, the diminutive Diego Maradona represented the revenge of the weak and the deprived.
As a result, his countrymen excused his frequent bad behavior time and again.
Similarly, Pelé became the symbol of a harmonious, inter-racial Brazil.
Zidane offered neither of these romantic images.
Moreover, after his career is over, he is unlikely to become a manager of his sport like Jean-Claude Killy, the former Alpine skier who was co-president of the 1992 winter Olympics, or his fellow football legend Michel Platini, who helped coordinate the 1998 World Cup.
After all, Zidane, arguably the world's best football player, left with a gesture that has no place in any game.
Nevertheless, Zidane will remain a global icon, owing to his profoundly human character and his extreme simplicity.
Here is a man who is known in the most hidden corners of the planet, yet he retained the presence and discretion of a silent next-door neighbor.
At a moment when integration is being debated in France, Zidane embodied the ideal of success through talent and hard work -- while never betraying himself or his Algerian origins.
Moreover, Zidane incarnated values that seem threatened nowadays, but to which ordinary people remain attached: loyalty to family, diligence, and cooperation.
Here is a man who was not only a world champion, but also a model son and father.
The almost timid way in which, after France's victory over Spain, he expressed his love for his mother touched viewers around the world.
To understand Zidane's popularity, one need only set his modesty and attention to others against the arrogance and indifference that characterize the behavior of so many other celebrities, including football players.
At a time when, in France as in the rest of the world, the chasm between the elite and ordinary people has never been so wide, when the smugness of the affluent has never been so cruelly felt by the less fortunate, Zidane, a son of despised immigrants, became an international star, and yet preserved the simplicity of his origins.
For this, Zidane was not only admired, but also respected.
His success was never to the detriment of others.
On the contrary, he is active in causes such as helping sick children.
It is obvious that he could one day become a tremendous ambassador of peace, or for children, working with the United Nations or another international organization.
But now the hero has fallen.
Zidane was not Superman, but a human being.
In a single instant of unfathomable fury, his moment of glory was transformed into one of madness and a curse.
His tragedy is ultimately a personal one.
Nevertheless, it would be a great loss -- extending far beyond the world of football -- if Zidane's disgraceful exit as a player comes to define his legacy as a man.
France's Royal Visage
How did Royal rise so far and so fast?
One reason is that she is the only fresh face among those Socialists vying for the party nomination.
Laurent Fabius, Martine Aubry, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, Jack Lang, and even Hollande are all former senior ministers who neutralized each other, while Lionel Jospin, the former Prime Minister, decided to put an end to his political career after his defeat in 2002.
Each of them has strengths and weaknesses, but none seems able to challenge Sarkozy.
Indeed, confronted with her lead, both Jospin and Hollande have dropped out of the race.
So there was a vacuum to fill, accompanied by a strong desire among the party faithful for revival.
Royal's chief virtue is that she has not taken part in the numerous internal battles that infuriate socialist militants and voters, and her lack of direct association with the party's leadership has enabled her to avoid blame for its mistakes.
That is why, far from being a disadvantage, her peripheral position is one of her main assets.
She has slim and politically minor ministerial experience -- Environment Minister in 1992-1993, Deputy Minister for Secondary Education in 1997-2000, and Minister for Family Affairs in 2000-2002 -- and has drawn attention mainly for her work on subjects related to daily problems, such as kids' TV programs and mistreatment in schools.
But, while other politicians do not regard these matters as politically important, they mean a lot to most ordinary citizens.
That is why people tend to view her as a sincere politician, rather than one concerned only about personal ambition.
On security issues and education, Royal differs from the classical left, being something of a hardliner.
This, too, is an advantage in a country where security is the top priority for most people nowadays.
A mother of four children who proclaims to believe in traditional family values, she is attractive to right-wing voters, while her non-matrimonial relationship with Hollande makes her seem a quintessentially modern woman.
Moreover, being a woman is a great asset.
When disturbed by a question, she usually replies, "Would you have asked the same question to a man?" Ever since Laurent Fabius took a hit in the polls when he mocked her candidacy by asking, "Who will mind the children?", her opponents have feared appearing misogynous when attacking her, and when they do criticize her, she immediately assumes the pose of innocent victim, unfairly bashed by schoolboy bullies.
As a political tactician, she has also been innovative, organizing her campaign on the Internet with a plan to write her program from the responses of users.
Her motto, "My program is yours," could prove popular with citizens who, as in many other democracies, do not trust their political elite.
Even though, like the majority of France's political class, she was educated at Ecole Nationale d'Administration (ENA), she spurns the language and habits of this elite factory.
Last but not least, she is attractive.
Photos of her in a swimming suit, taken by paparazzi during the summer, triggered much discussion across France.
But the game is not over.
The Socialist will decide on November 17th who will be their candidate.
Trailing her in opinion polls, the other contenders cite her lack of credibility on economic policy and international relations.
No one knows her opinion on the Middle East, terrorism, nuclear deterrence, and international security.
During the recent Lebanon war, she called for Bill Clinton's intervention -- an insufficient answer for many people.
Royal's lack of program has been her strength, but it could yet be her undoing.
Eventually, she will be obliged to abandon her studied ambiguity, and she will probably pay a price for doing so.
Few voters will support someone whose political program is based only on education and defense of the family.
Some Socialists fear that, once nominated, she would not be able to confront Sarkozy in direct debates.
Moreover, opinion polls in France are fickle omens.
Since 1981, no poll favorite has won the presidency.
According to the polls, Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, not François Mitterrand, should have been elected in 1981.
In 1988, just months before the election, Raymond Barre (a former Prime Minister) was the arch-favorite, but did not even qualify for the second-round run-off.
A few weeks before the election in 1995, Jacques Chirac looked so weak that a journalist bluntly asked him on live TV whether it would not be better for him to give up.
And Jospin was considered the only possible winner in 2002, before finishing third, behind Chirac and Jean-Marie Le Pen.
But Royal is confident in her fate.
She is far from being a weak contender, and she is a fast learner with a strong campaign team.
If she can strengthen her program on foreign policy, she may yet open a new chapter in French political history.
Peace through Superior Football
The Israel-Palestine conflict has lasted far too long.
The Annapolis peace conference ended a seven-year freeze on negotiations, with President George W. Bush asking the conflict's main protagonists to reach an agreement by the end of 2008.
Nothing prevents us from hoping that a fair and just peace can be achieved by then.
There is no curse that keeps Israelis and Palestinians from living side by side peacefully.
Where there is a will, there is a way.
But nurturing the will to achieve long-lasting peace depends on more than political negotiations.
Israelis and Palestinians need an underlying source of solidarity if they are ever to settle their large disagreements and prevent their small ones from erupting into violence.
Although football cannot solve the region's major strategic problems, it has much to contribute in this regard.
Football mobilizes energies and unites enthusiasms.
After the 2010 World Cup in South Africa -- a country where peace has taken root -- and before the 2014 tournament in Brazil, it will be time to select the host for 2018.
If a peace agreement is concluded before that choice is made, a 2018 World Cup jointly staged in Israel and Palestine would be a fantastic opportunity to consolidate the gains for both sides.
Infrastructure investment would then follow. 
The joint organization of the 2018 World Cup in a place where two peoples were once at war would serve as a powerful symbol of the way that sports can serve the cause of peace.
Indeed, the prospect of hosting the football World Cup might constitute yet another incentive for Israelis and Palestinians to reach a settlement.
Let us imagine that they could then work hand in hand to host the biggest sporting event in the world.
Bombing the US Budget
The US Defense Department's request for $515.4 billion in the 2009 fiscal year dwarfs every other military budget in the world.
And this huge sum -- a 5% increase over the 2008 military budget --  is to be spent only on the US military's normal operations, thus excluding the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Since he took office in 2001, President George W. Bush has increased America's regular military budget by 30%, again not taking into account the cost of the wars he launched.
Last year, America's entire military and counterterrorism expenditures topped $600 billion.
One can assume that next year's total spending on military affairs will be even bigger.
Adjusted for inflation, US military spending has reached its highest level since World War II.
Is there any limit to this spending boom?
The US is allocating more money for defense today than it did during the war against Hitler or the Cold War.
The Bush administration seems to think that today's military threats are graver.
Talk about the so-called "peace dividend" that was supposed to come with the fall of the Berlin Wall has been silenced.
Of course, because the US economy has grown faster than military spending, the share of GDP dedicated to military expenditures has fallen over the years.
The US spent 14% of its GDP on the military during the Korean War (1950-1953, the Cold War's peak), 9% during the Vietnam War and only 4 % nowadays.
Yet, given the sheer scale of military spending today, one can wonder if it is rational.
The US economy is probably in recession, clouds are gathering over its pension and health-care systems, and its military budget may not make sense even in strategic terms.
America alone accounts for around 50% of the world's military expenditures, which is historically unprecedented for a single country.
Most other countries don't come anywhere close.
Indeed, the second-ranked country in terms of total annual military spending, the United Kingdom, lags far behind, at $55 billion, followed by France ($45 billion), Japan ($41 billion), and Germany ($35 billion).
China and Russia, which can be considered strategic rivals of the US, spend $35 billion and $24 billion, respectively (though these figures probably underestimate expenditure, the true amount is certainly still far below the US -- level).
Iran, depicted by the Bush administration as a major threat, is a military dwarf, spending $6.6 billion on its military.
Some voices in America are calling for even bigger increases.
Indeed, the Pentagon wants to enlarge the Marine Corps and Special Operations forces.
Since it is increasingly difficult to recruit and retain soldiers, to do so will probably require raising their wages and improving their quality of life.
Disabled soldiers also will cost a lot of money, even if the Pentagon won't automatically pay everything for them.
But fulfilling the ostensible rationale for this seemingly interminable spending orgy -- success in the so-called "war on terror" -- does not seem anywhere within reach.
Mike McConnell, America's Director of National Intelligence, recently admitted to a US Senate panel that al-Qaeda is gaining strength and steadily improving its ability to recruit, train, and even attack the US.
That assessment is stunning, yet few American leaders -- Democrats and Republicans alike -- appear to be wondering if military power is the best answer to security issues.
Indeed, by relying mainly on military solutions to political problems, the US seems to be increasing rather than reducing the threats it faces.
After all, the dangers that America faces today do not come from nation states, but from non-states actors against whom nuclear weapons and aircraft carriers are useless.
It would be less expensive and more fruitful for America to tackle the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, return to a multilateral approach, and respect the moral principles that it recommends to others.
Likewise, only by adopting such a strategy can the US start to compress the Pentagon's inflated budget and begin to address its many domestic woes.
Sarkozy's Secret Rupture
Of course, it is impossible at this early stage to evaluate with any degree of precision the long-term strategic repercussions of Sarkozy's apparent decision to return France to NATO's integrated military command and strengthen the French military commitment to NATO's out-of-theater engagement -- its first ever -- in Afghanistan.
But the implication of these decisions is clear: France under Sarkozy is now back at the heart of the Atlantic Alliance.
Although this may seem mundane outside France, Sarkozy's foreign policy revolution has incited fierce opposition at home.
Indeed, all left-wing parties denounce Sarkozy's rupture with the Fifth Republic's military/diplomatic heritage.
Of course, the left's real quarrel with Sarkozy's policy has at its roots in his conception of France's relationship with the United States.
Wariness of America was, to be sure, not just a leftist pose; many Gaullists over the decades have been tinged with anti-Americanism, too.
But, although Sarkozy may not have sold his party on the merits of George Bush's America, he has softened its once habitual suspicions about the US.
As a result, a left-right divide has opened in this central area of French diplomacy -- a division that has not been seen in France for four decades.
The French left, not surprisingly, rejects Sarkozy's Atlanticist impulses and frequently charge him with betraying General de Gaulle's legacy.
The majority of French people, however, appear to favor improving ties with the US.
There is more than a little irony here.
In the year that the Socialists are celebrating the fortieth anniversary of the May 1968 demonstrations against de Gaulle, they are also trying to steal his diplomatic clothes by proclaiming themselves the defenders of the independent French foreign policy that he championed.
In the 1960's, both Socialists and Centrists denounced de Gaulle's "anti-Americanism."
On NATO, France's Middle East policy, or the constitution, Francois Mitterrand (the Socialist leader in the 1960's) and the opposition sharply criticized de Gaulle's go-it-alone ways for shattering the Alliance consensus.
Indeed, the Socialists opposed de Gaulle's decision to withdraw France from NATO's unified military command, opposed the creation of an independent French nuclear arsenal (they preferred the American nuclear guarantee), and were hostile to de Gaulle's rupture with Israel after the Six Day War.
But the Socialists began to change their stripes in the late 1970's, rallying around the concept of nuclear dissuasion as a guarantee of national independence and beginning to distance themselves from America.
Although Mitterrand did stand firm with the US on the stationing of Pershing missiles in Europe in the early 1980's, which won him respect from President Ronald Reagan, by this point the Gaullist consensus on the fundamentals of French foreign policy had spread across all political groups.
Even the Communist Party could be said to have basically embraced its tenets.
Sarkozy has now broken with this so-called "Gaullist- Mitterrandist" orientation, which was based on the persistence of a belief in French "exceptionalism" in the field of foreign affairs.  This does not mean that Sarkozy's France will toe the American line on all international issues.
Far from it.
But it does mean that France will no longer oppose America just for the sake of opposing America.
Female Genital Mutilation Mutilates Us All
On December 10th, women from around the world will gather at the European Parliament to fight against Female Genital Mutilation.
According to the World Health Organization, some 130 million women have, over the last few years, suffered from genital mutilation in some form.
In reality, those figures are probably even worse, because illegalities are almost always underestimated.
Female genital mutilation, according to the WHO, consists of the "removal of all or part of the external female genital organs."
It is a painful procedure carried out in unsafe ways by old women who are seeking to initiate girls into womanhood, and, more concretely, into a life that will be an unending chain of physical pain and social marginalization.
Indeed, genital mutilation makes a woman's experience of sex, that taboo of taboos, into a painful, humiliating, punitive procedure.
Over the last 80 years, women in democratic societies have struggled to be recognized and treated as citizens endowed with equal rights.
The right to own property, vote, work, divorce, the right to choose whether or not to have children have been secured only through political struggle.
All these civil victories for women contributed mightily to the advancement of social life and have been instrumental in initiating comprehensive social reforms that have transformed Western societies.
In these epochal battles, women's fiercest enemy has been tradition, and its staunch ally: religion.
With the help of information, education and mass participation, women and men, have defeated ignorance and the violence that goes with it hand-in-hand.
The fight against female genital mutilation is not a replay of the West's 'battle of the sexes' circa the 1960s; rather, it is a struggle against the fear of unknown enemies; against fear of change and the opportunities and contexts that arrive in the wake of change.
Throughout the world, from sub-Saharan Africa to the Arab peninsula, from certain regions of the Far East to expatriate communities in Europe, the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, women are reacting against their being genitally, socially, civilly, and politically mutilated.
In other words, they react to their being considered and treated like some "unknown other."
Networks of local practitioners, non-governmental organizations and politicians are collaborating to confront the issue of female genital mutilation at a national level and to publicize it.
There are ongoing efforts in Africa and elsewhere to internationalize a campaign that seeks to bring to galvanize public awareness of the dark fact that, in many countries, women remain mere commodities at the disposal of tradition.
Today, most of the African, Arab, and Asian countries blighted by the custom female genital mutilation are nonetheless signatories of the international conventions that condemn this practice, particularly the international Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women and the international Convention on the Rights of the Child.
Most of these countries also support a series of UN resolutions that call for eliminating female genital mutilation.
But all these commendable efforts have failed to counter the phenomenon.
So the issue is not good words and public promises, it is one of securing the political will necessary to stamp out the practice.
Female genital mutilation is a crime with real victims, but who are the criminals?
Should we incarcerate all women who carry out these mutilations on their fellow women?
Should we imprison mothers because they are willingly sacrifice their daughters' physical integrity on the altar of tradition?
Should we impose sanctions on countries that do not make the practice unlawful?
Should we patrol remote African villages with groups of human rights activists?
Tradition can only be countered by creativity.
We need to find ways to address the lack of a real freedom of expression for women in so many societies and, at the same, time to redress damage done to those victimized by female genital mutilation.
In doing so, we must be aware that the solution to genital mutilation of women cannot be limited to this issue alone.
In fact, it needs to be part of a more comprehensive effort aiming at empowering and giving civil rights to women - 50% of the people that live in societies where the practice is carried out.
Such a concerted action must go beyond the sacrosanct effort of providing the old women who practice female genital mutilation with another job or in finding symbolic or ritualistic substitutes to the act of cutting off a woman's clitoris.
We need to reach into politics, because there will be no freedom for African, Arab, or Asian women without the advent of political democracy in their countries.
Here is the challenge that confronts those who live in countries where female genital mutilation is not routinely practiced but who care about the fate of women around the world.
Failure to recognize the political aspect of the issue will insure defeat and the continuance of a violent practice that abuses millions of women each year.
Over the last few years, I have had the chance to meet hundreds of individuals and groups in places where the practice exists.
Those people made the fight against female genital mutilation a priority in their lives.
Their courage, expertise, dedication and resolve is encouraging, but we must not leave them to fight their fight alone.
In Brussels on December 11th, eminent personalities from Africa and all over the world will launch an appeal open to signatures to internationalize their struggle.
Those who want to join the Stop Female Genital Mutilation campaign carried out by AIDOS (Italian Association of Women for Development), TAMWA (Tanzania Media Women's Association), and No Peace Without Justice can sign the petition by visiting www.stopfgm.org .
In allowing so many lives to be blighted through genital mutilation, we degrade ourselves and our world.
The Other War That Should Be Stopped
The world's attention has been focused on the war on Iraq.
But another war--this one UN-sanctioned--has been going on simultaneously: the war on drugs.
In my view, every sensible person should want this largely ignored war to end as well.
While the UN should play a role in leading Iraq toward a free and democratic society, it must also change dramatically its own course in the war on drugs and lead the world to a saner policy.
In 1998, to celebrate the 10
On April 16 Illicit Drug Trends , new markets for narcotics are expanding faster than old ones are being shut down.
Drug dealers, like sharp businessmen everywhere, have gone out and found new markets.
Eastern countries (the postcommunist world in Europe and the richer countries of Asia) are consuming more and more drugs, because the older markets of Western Europe and North America are saturated.
Across the world, narcotics trafficking is on the increase, not only because new markets are coming online, but also because new countries have taken up production.
Moreover, new synthetic and chemical substances, which are more potent and often less expensive than the "classic" ones, are being invented.
It is time to acknowledge that the "war on drugs" is lost--indeed, a monumental failure--and that hostilities should end.
Every aspect of the war strategy has failed.
Harsh new domestic laws in many countries have not only failed to control the spread of drugs throughout the world, but have delivered a vast new source of state intrusiveness into the lives of millions of people.
Prohibition created a pretext for authoritarian regimes to resist the abolition of death penalty; yet even states that execute people for drug-related crimes have not been able to stem the tide.
To circumvent the harsh legal regime now in place narcotics mafias have forged ever-tighter alliances with terrorist networks.
Can the world afford to continue subsidizing this failure?
Can our money be wasted for much longer on fumigating Colombian valleys or arresting non-violent drug offenders?
Can we--including those of us who are elected officials--pretend that prohibitions on illicit drugs will one day prove effective?
The answer to all these questions, of course, is: "No, we cannot."
Instead, we must recognize that prohibition, rather than curtailing use, generates crime, because it makes trading in illicit drugs a lucrative business.
As politicians everywhere remain loath to be seen as "soft on drugs," something must be done to call attention to this remorseless failure.
One ploy taken up by some members of my Transnational Radical Party in France, Belgium, the UK, and Italy has been to "denounce themselves" to their national authorities and then to disobey the prohibitionist laws by distributing drugs to passers-by during political demonstrations.
By openly inviting the police to jail otherwise respected members of the community, these activists hope to show the absurdity of harsh anti-drug laws.
These Gandhian acts of non-violent civil disobedience have had an effect.
Recently, 109 members of the European Parliament introduced a recommendation calling for reform of the UN Conventions on drugs.
An "International Anti-Prohibitionist League" is now at work, calling for repeal or amendment of the UN treaties in order to allow for experimentation with legalization by individual nations.
At the upcoming Commission on Narcotics meeting in April, UN member states will have an opportunity to reassess the effectiveness of the 1998 Plan of Action.
Sadly, however, the reality of its failure to come anywhere close to achieving its stated goals has not dented the minds of national governments: not one state has voiced its opposition to current strategies.
But turning a blind eye to failure only increases its cost.
So long as the UN anti-drug mandates remain in place, legalization of treatments, cures, and drugs that today are illicit--and recall that it was the end of prohibition alone that ended the reign of gangsters like Al Capone in the 1920s--will remain impossible.
The Vienna meeting offers a rare opportunity to change course.
Instead of insisting on replicating our failures, the world needs to adopt new approaches that treat the disease of drug use, instead of criminalizing it.
Otherwise, we will all remain addicted to a failed drug war.
For an International Trial of Saddam Hussein
Now that Saddam Hussein has been captured, the world's attention has turned to his trial.
Should Saddam be tried by Iraqis in Iraq, or should he face an international tribunal?
The forthcoming conference on democracy, human rights and the role of the International Criminal Court in Yemen on January 10-12 will provide a forum to debate these questions.
It is, of course, certain that Saddam Hussein will not escape trial for the extra-judicial, extra-legal and summary executions, torture, and systematic persecution of hundreds of thousands of Iraqis that marked his decades of murderous misrule.
However, the aim of his trial should be not only to bring to justice the dictator and his accomplices, but also to foster national reconciliation through the affirmation by Iraqis of universal principles such as non-discrimination, fairness, and transparency.
For years, Iraq has only known the brutal laws of force and intimidation.
If judging Saddam Hussein and his regime is to become a cornerstone in the building of a free, democratic, and reconciled Iraq, then the US, as the leader of the coalition that ousted him, should do everything in its power to pursue this opportunity and set a very high standard of justice.
President George W. Bush has stated that he would "work with Iraqis to develop a way to try [Saddam Hussein] that will withstand international scrutiny."
The best way to address that scrutiny and avoid accusations of "victor's justice" is to involve other international players in the exercise.
These institutions have finally established the principle that major violations of human rights and dignity are of universal concern and that the international community should actively participate in the quest for justice and reparation for victims.
While no one doubts the willingness of Iraqi judges to try their former "head of state" in a national court, the novelty of such an effort and its political implications suggest some type of international participation for the sake of competence and, most of all, impartiality.
Over the last ten years, the international community has established special or ad hoc tribunals, with international participation in those situations where local institutions could not ensure due process of law or fair trials.
Iraq presents another such situation.
Thirty years of brutal dictatorship have destroyed the very concept of justice in Iraq.
For justice must mean more than the cries of "Death to Saddam" that now echo in some quarters around the world.
Stem Cell Obscurantism
On May 19, a group of Korean scientists published in the magazine Science the results of research that for the first time isolated human embryonic stem cell lines specifically tailored to match the DNA of male and female patients of various ages.
The next day, British scientists at Newcastle University announced that they had successfully produced a cloned human embryo using donated eggs and genetic material from stem cells.
Both breakthroughs constitute a stunning advance in stem cell research.
Embryonic stem cells are pluripotent, meaning that they have the ability to develop into any type of human tissue.
This carries great promise, in particular, for sufferers of spinal cord injuries and diseases.
Years of studies, and the passionate pleas of patients worldwide, are finally opening the way to a technique -- somatic cell nuclear transfer, also known as "therapeutic cloning" -- that may bring about epochal changes for the health of us all.
No less remarkable than the latest discoveries was the timing of their announcement, which came on the eve of a vote in the United States Congress to expand federal funding for research on embryonic stem cells created during in vitro fertilization (but never implanted in a womb).
Both announcements also came a month ahead of an Italian referendum -- the largest popular consultation on the matter ever held anywhere -- that seeks to change a law adopted last year that prohibits both in vitro fertilization and stem cell research.
The debate over therapeutic cloning is, of course, hardly limited to the US and Italy.
The UN General Assembly ended a two-year debate on the matter in March 2005 by approving a non-binding declaration that calls upon states to "prohibit all forms of human cloning inasmuch as they are incompatible with human dignity and the protection of human life." The declaration passed with 84 votes in favor, 34 against, and 37 abstentions.
Last summer, in response to the UN decision, 78 Nobel laureates signed a petition discouraging the adoption of an international ban on human cloning, because "it would condemn hundreds of millions of individuals afflicted by debilitating diseases to a life deprived of hope." The petition, initiated by Luca Coscioni Association, an NGO devoted to the promotion of the freedom of scientific research, called on governments to reject prohibitions in favor of "rules that protect the right to life and health by ensuring freedom of research, choice, and knowledge."
There is, of course, widespread consensus against cloning devoted to the reproduction of human beings, and most of the world has outlawed the technique.
So this is not the issue.
The Nobelists' point is that, as far as therapeutic cloning is concerned, rather than attempting global prohibition, it would be much wiser, and possibly more effective, to promote an international regulatory regime through ample legalization of stem cell research.
But, as the UN declaration -- and the long debate surrounding its adoption -- illustrate, scientific arguments are not at the center of national and international debates, which revolve around questions concerning the beginning of "human life."
As we know, science and religion offer different answers.
Some Christian theologians, for example, believe that life begins at conception, while scientists maintain that nerve and brain cells emerge around 14 days after conception.
Scientists generally agree that research should be done within that period -- and always allowed on spare embryos that will never be implanted.
In such a crucially important debate, the quality of the information offered is paramount, and it is no coincidence that those who oppose stem cell research prefer to avoid a public debate that would force them to confront scientific arguments.
They know all too well that whenever a secular and scientific debate has been permitted and encouraged, the general public -- regardless of nationality and religious or political affiliation -- has overwhelmingly expressed itself in favor of stem cell research.
We saw a clear example of this last November in California, where 60% of the electorate voted in favor of Proposition 71 on state funding for stem cell research.
Similarly, the latest polls in Italy suggest that the overwhelming majority of those who intend to vote are in favor of therapeutic cloning.
However, a referendum in Italy requires 50% turnout to validate the outcome.
Revealingly, the Vatican, knowing that it cannot win, is currently campaigning strongly for mass abstention.
More than the advancement of science is at stake here.
The Vatican's stance on the Italian vote is emblematic of a broader threat to the very foundation of modern liberal democracy: the constitutional separation of Church and State.
In an era of growing concern about religious fundamentalism, liberal democratic institutions must reaffirm their role in protecting individual rights for all.
And, in order to enable the full enjoyment of our freedoms -- be they of worship or scientific research -- the state must reassert its secular nature.
We need mechanisms to address violations of moral or religious beliefs, but we cannot place restrictions on individuals' ability to contribute to the public welfare.
Poppy Power
This proposal was originally made by the Senlis Council, an independent organization based in Paris, during a workshop in Kabul last September.
The text introduced by the European Liberal Democrats, with the support of virtually all political groups in the European Parliament, is revolutionary, not only because it goes against conventional thinking, but also because it raises the issue above the stagnant reality of the "war on drugs."
In Afghanistan, that so-called war has essentially been based on eradication campaigns and alternative livelihood projects, which have achieved only scant results.
The European Parliament's new stance may, I hope, mark the beginning of a radical policy shift by all actors involved in rebuilding Afghanistan.
According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, despite concerted efforts at eradication and crop substitution, Afghanistan produced 87% of the world's opium in 2005 -- roughly 4.1 tons -- generating $2.7 billion of illegal revenue, which amounts to roughly 52% of the country's GDP.
The 2005 Afghanistan Opium Survey, released last November, estimates that the total value of this opium, once turned into heroin and distributed around the world, could reach more than $40 billion.
Moreover, in recent years, factories and laboratories for processing opium into heroin have been sprouting in Afghanistan, producing 420 tons of heroin last year alone.
The increase in domestic heroin production has provided a massive boost to the local retail market, giving rise to concerns about HIV/AIDS spreading in a country with poor infrastructure and nonexistent health services.
In addition, the itineraries used by the export convoys are no longer limited to the infamous "golden route" through Pakistan and Iran, but have multiplied, employing exit points in former Soviet Republics such as Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan.
This is helping to promote further instability in already volatile political contexts.
International counter-narcotics policy is currently driven by pressure for rapid and visible results.
But eradication and alternative livelihood projects mainly affect the lowest end of the value-added chain, the farmers, with no real impact on those higher up, such as large landowners and local traffickers, not to mention the extremely powerful drug lords and the international cartels and mafias.
Most landless farmers find it difficult to switch to different crops, being caught up as they are in the illegal opium-denominated market, which forces them to live at the mercy of the drug traffickers, who provide them with access to credit and market outlets.
The result of this was laid out in a report by the European Union's Election Observation Mission that I presented in Kabul last December: Afghanistan risks becoming a "rentier" state with easy access to resources that lubricate corruption throughout its entire political system, finance illegal armed groups, and fuel regional destabilization.
Illicit Afghan networks, replicating well-known methods that organized crime has applied successfully for decades in other parts of the world, are mobile and resourceful, and can plug into a range of legal economic activities to sustain themselves.
This might lead Afghanistan into a situation of no return: becoming a narco-state that drifts away from any form of rule of law and disengages itself from the fragile social contract with its own citizens that it has started to establish.
As New York University's Barnett Rubin, an expert on Afghan society, has put it: "Afghanistan cannot be stabilized while the most dynamic sector of its economy is illegal, nor if more than half of its economy is destroyed."
So what should be done?
Because of the serious threat that the illegal drug economy poses to stability and democracy in Afghanistan, we must start thinking in terms of regulated poppy growing for medical purposes, in particular for painkillers, with the active participation of donor countries and the UN itself.
Indeed, the UN estimates that just six countries prescribe 78% of the total legal production of opiates, implying shortages of opium-based painkillers in many of the UN's 185 other member states.
Hence the potential legal demand is huge.
Moreover, the UN also estimates that there are 45 million people living with HIV/AIDS in countries where health systems are either absent or very poor, and that over the next 20 years there will be some 10 million new cases of cancer in the developing world.
These estimates, together with poor countries' additional needs when natural catastrophes strike, imply that the potential legal demand for medicinal opiates is even higher.
An increase in production of "medical" opium would address its lack of availability worldwide.
It would also provide Afghan peasants, who have been growing poppy despite forced eradication of the plant and incentives to change crops, with an option that is regulated by law and that, in time, could have an impact on the heroin trade.
Governments, international organizations and individuals that participate in the London conference must not dismiss the call made by the European Parliament, for it offers a far more workable strategy to promote Afghanistan's future than the current counter-narcotics policies permit.
Killing the Death Penalty
But will this December's vote be a mere formality?
Experience teaches us to be prudent.
I have not opened my bottle of spumante yet.
To be honest, I am not sure that all of the world's governments have accepted the inevitable, or that even the most inflexible will now agree to the moratorium.
But I continue to have faith that the General Assembly will know, as always, how to meet this challenge.
We are all aware that even if the vote succeeds, the UN resolution will not be binding, and that establishing and enforcing a moratorium is only a necessary mid-way step toward full abolition.
I believe the UN should push for an immediate de facto suspension, without waiting for the debates to begin on legal reforms in the respective countries.
I hope that this approach will allow a wide consensus in the General Assembly, and that any last minute change of heart will fail.
One big lesson I learned during the struggle to create the International Criminal Court (ICC), and now during the battle for a moratorium on the death penalty, is that it is often better to aim for a realistic result rather than a perfect one.
Before the international community established the ICC, there were two ad hoc tribunals -- one for the former Yugoslavia and one for Rwanda.  Their work paved the way for the ICC.
Some European Union countries wanted to push for complete abolition of the death penalty right away.
I understand their position.
I would have wanted the same thing myself.
But had we followed that route, we would most likely have failed.
There is an important lesson in this for the EU at a time when it is seeking to become a global actor: we must reach an internal consensus while always bearing in mind what the external ramifications of our decision might be.
On the moratorium, we remained pragmatic and built a strong European foreign policy.
And it was an advantage in the UN negotiations to have a common Europeans position and to have spoken with a single voice.
A second lesson that I learned is also useful for the EU, which finds itself in a world in which new powers are emerging and where all actors from Manila to Algiers, from Doha to Libreville, must deal with the challenges of globalization and interdependence on a daily basis.
That lesson is that Europe has more friends than it has enemies in the world.
These friends deserve respect and attention.
If Italy and the EU had not understood the need to work with non-European countries, and make them feel that they were responsible and fully-fledged protagonists, the efforts to establish the ICC and be so close to declare a universal moratorium on the death penalty would have failed.
I know that this is not exactly a new lesson, but it is what I have in mind when I think of efficient multilateralism.
Not only does it work, but, above all, in some cases, it is the only way of moving forward.
Finally, a third lesson -- relevant to the fight against the death penalty and, indeed, to winning any political battle -- is perseverance, which I consider to be a mix of pig-headedness and the ability to maintain one's position.
Without perseverance, there can be no progress.
All this is a success, not only for anti-death penalty radicals, for the "Hands off Cain" association, the Italian government, and for the European Union and its friends in the world.
It is much more: it is a success for all those who believe that it is still possible to improve our world -- and ultimately the human condition -- every day.
A New Deal for the New World
As former members of our countries' congresses we believe that it is time to create a North American Parliamentary Union (NAPU) to address the growing number of big issues that North America's national governments have pushed to the sidelines.
Both past and present have been burdened by the ad hoc nature of relations among the United States, Mexico, and Canada.
A fairer, more prosperous future for all three countries demands that we take a bold step forward.
Despite US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld's snide reference to ``Old Europe,'' North Americans can learn much from the European Union and European Parliament.
In the 1950's, most of Europe considered the idea of a Union with a single Parliament a pipe dream.
Today the EU elects its Parliament, shares a single currency, and controls a budget that emphasizes raising living standards within the less developed member countries.
Within the near future, the EU is likely to be 450 million people strong.
The combined population of the US, Mexico, and Canada is about 410 million people.
Yet North America has failed to match Europe in building the political structures necessary to focus the hemisphere on the problems of immigration, cross border security, labor rights, and environmental degradation; or in facilitating a more united approach to strong economic competition from Europe and Asia.
On the contrary, in the aftermath of the Iraq War, relations between the US and its neighbors, Canada and Mexico, are at their lowest level in years.
Clearly, efforts to deepen North American political and economic integration will be an uphill battle.
In the near future, the US government will be focused on homeland security, Iraq, the slumping domestic economy, and the run-up to the 2004 presidential election.
Canada's government has been more willing to approach North American issues on a bilateral basis than in a tri-national context; furthermore, Canadians are preoccupied with the consequences and aftermath of SARS and mad cow disease, as well as anticipating a new government next year.
Mexico's President Vincente Fox will govern through 2006.
But his vision of a North American Free Trade Association (NAFTA) encompassing elements of social and political fusion with his North American counterparts was sidetracked by the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and by his political rivals' recent successes at the polls.
Notwithstanding this, most Canadians and Mexicans believe that cooperation in North America will proceed regardless of who is in office in Ottawa, Washington, or Mexico City.
Not only are Canada and Mexico the US's first and second largest trading partners, but the three countries maintain a myriad of relationships--in business, tourism, and culture--that do not pass through their embassies or governments.
Good feelings abound.
US citizens register high approval ratings in Canada and Mexico: 90% and 70%, respectively.
In proposing the creation of NAPU, we envision a specific plan to create a larger market by fostering an alliance between the three economies.
In just a single decade, the EU managed to bring poorer, peripheral member states--Greece, Portugal, Spain, and Ireland--from 50% to 90% of the EU average in per capita income, creating a bigger market for companies from wealthier northern countries, and stemming migration from poorer southern economies.
The EU invested upwards of $35 billion a year to assure the success of their Common Market integration.
North America has largely ignored the significance of ``common,'' preferring to focus on ``market.''
This blinded all three countries to the centrality of community.
We have failed to understand that a North American Free Trade Area (NAFTA) that achieves its full potential cannot be accomplished on the cheap.
A regional political structure will maintain the focus on vital but difficult issues such as immigration.
NAFTA was conceived under the assumption that expanded trade would trickle down benefits to all in the three countries.
Regretfully, this corporate-driven NAFTA exacerbated the disparities and asymmetries between Mexico and its two richer northern neighbors.
Moreover, throughout NAFTA's lifetime income and wealth have been further concentrated within the elite sectors of US and Canadian society.
Immigration illustrates the cost of integration without convergence.
Demand for low-cost Mexican labor by US employers and the 10-1 wage gap between the two countries pushes 350,000 Mexicans to risk their lives every year for better paid jobs north of the border.
Without Mexican manpower, much of the work in the US simply would not get done.
The issue must be addressed, not ignored and criminalized.
NAPU would be the ideal forum in which to address this concern.
Everywhere nowadays, key decisions are made by a self-selected group of elites, often in non-transparent circumstances.
NAPU would allow for wider, more consistent participation in the consideration of issues now ignored in all three countries.
Inter-American issues can no longer be left subject to the whims and convenience of individual leaders.
The people of the US, Canada, and Mexico deserve better.
Insuring Against Panic
WASHINGTON, D.C.: The panics of the past two years in emerging markets have driven home many lessons about the global economy.
It is now all too clear that in a world of interwoven financial markets and potentially destabilizing capital flows, there is a greater risk than ever that a crisis in one country will trigger crises elsewhere.
The international community—the IMF and its member countries, other international organizations and the private sector—is addressing this challenge by devising a set of reforms that have come to be known as the "new international financial architecture."
Important progress has been made on this task, but much remains to be done.
Taken together, the reforms being undertaken are designed to create multiple lines of defense that would operate across borders and within individual countries—affecting the way that governments and the private sector operate.
These reforms bring together new or strengthened standards for financial systems, markets, and businesses with a commitment to new levels of transparency.
The aim is to ensure that all parties have access to accurate economic data and information about potentially market-moving developments.
Included in these new global ground rules are standards for such areas as fiscal and monetary policies, accounting, corporate governance, and securities and insurance regulation.
Observance of internationally recognized standards and greater transparency, when combined with sound macroeconomic policies, should place countries on a firmer footing.
By helping to make adverse economic or policy developments more apparent, greater transparency is also likely to lead to earlier incentives for governments to take corrective action.
Prevention, however, must also address the dangers posed by the potentially destabilizing movements of capital.
Recent experience teaches that the speed and magnitude with which both domestic and foreign investors can move into and out of capital markets far exceeds the ability of individual countries—and the international community—to counter such flows.
Many countries do not have foreign currency reserves sufficient to meet sudden and large outflows of capital without destabilizing their domestic economy.
Sometimes these outflows can occur through no fault of the country concerned, but as a result of financial market contagion that spreads from disturbances elsewhere.
This phenomenon was all too evident during the Asian crisis and following the Russian debt default of August 1998.
To help prevent such contagion, the IMF has created a Contingent Credit Line (CCL), a program aimed at providing countries with the financial resources they need to combat a loss of market confidence stemming from events beyond their own policies or economic conditions.
In essence, it will function as an insurance policy for healthy countries of the world financial system.
The CCL marks a significant change in how the IMF interacts with its members.
The Fund traditionally has been asked for assistance by a country seeking to repair the damage after a crisis; contingent lending shifts the emphasis to preventative medicine from curative medicine.
The purpose is to ward off the contagion that posed such a threat to countries with generally good policies over the past two years.
As the new international financial architecture is put in place, the CCL could emerge as an important element in forestalling future crises.
In order to qualify for the CCL, countries will have the incentive to take proactive steps to eliminate the weaknesses that could leave them vulnerable.
Countries can be eligible to obtain a credit line at the IMF if they are making good progress adhering to international standards; working to establish and maintain strong financial systems; maintaining sound fiscal and monetary policies; establishing constructive relationships with private creditors; and satisfactorily managing their external debt and reserves.
All of these elements are aimed at helping countries to withstand the pressure on their balance of payments that might arise from a sudden loss of confidence caused by crises in other countries.
The CCL is intended to provide markets with a seal of approval for good policies, backed up by money—if needed.
Ideally, countries will never have to draw on that money, because the credit line will symbolize their strong defenses against contagion.
It may also mean that the Fund will have to undertake fewer rescue efforts in the future as the markets come to recognize the efforts of individual countries to address potential problems.
The IMF will play a central role not just by providing contingent financing, but also by monitoring more closely and offering technical assistance to individual countries so as to ensure that their policies accord with the international consensus for reform.
At the same time, the IMF itself has made a commitment to greater openness in the way it interacts with countries and makes its decisions.

All of this is part of a learning process intended to reduce the risk that the global economy might again have to go through the kind of difficult passage that threatened decades of prosperity and harmed the livelihood of millions of people.
The Euro at Ten
The euro was launched in January 1999 for a complex set of economic, financial, political, and historical reasons.
It was the final icing on the cake of the plan by many post-World War II leaders, driven by the memory of two horrible world wars originating in and consuming Europe in the previous half-century, to forge closer economic and political ties.
Ten years ago, there were real concerns about launching the new currency.
Would people give up their old national currencies and use the new euro?
Would it maintain its value against the dollar?
(Launched at $1.18, it plunged to almost $0.80 early on, then rose, peaking at nearly $1.60 in 2007-2008, before falling back to around $1.30.)
When a group of individual currencies is replaced by a single currency, as the Deutsche mark, French franc, Italian lira, Spanish peseta, and others were by the euro, there are two primary benefits: lower transaction costs and greater transparency.
Having neither the cost and inconvenience of constant currency transactions nor the uncertainty that arises from fluctuations among currencies is a boon to the common currency area.
And pricing of goods and labor throughout the currency area, which previously had different exchange rates, becomes much more transparent.
The cost of cell-phone minutes in Italy, for example, is much more easily compared to those in Germany or France.
These twin benefits complement the scale advantages of free-trade areas.
Europe is still realizing the full potential of these benefits, but struggling with natural cross-border mergers and the failure or replacement of prominent national companies by better competitors from other countries.
Many proponents of the euro claimed that it would quickly evolve as an alternative reserve currency alongside the dollar, or even replace it, in global markets.
Most of world trade is still invoiced in dollars, but the euro has gradually emerged as a viable alternative -- a strong currency backed by the hard-earned inflation credibility of the European Central Bank.
What, then, of the costs?
Why don't all nations join currency areas, or why not create a single global currency, as Nobel laureate Robert Mundell suggests?
One obvious reason is that there are also disadvantages to a common currency area.
Suppose that southern Europe is hit much harder by today's recession than northern Europe.  An economy has two potential ways to adapt to and mitigate its downturn.
First, its currency would naturally depreciate, making exports more competitive and imports more expensive.
This partially cushions the downturn.
Alternatively, labor could migrate from high-unemployment southern Europe to lower-unemployment northern Europe. 
The United States offers an important example of such labor mobility.
In the early 1980's, when US unemployment reached almost 11%, many workers moved from the so-called Rust Belt -- the hardest-hit industrial area of the upper Midwest -- to other parts of the country.
In the early 1990's, when California had a more severe recession, people sought jobs in neighboring states.
Labor migration operated as a safety valve against even worse unemployment.
Labor migration in Europe is, historically, far less extensive.
Many don't want to abandon the deep roots they have in their home regions; others don't want to move to another country, where language and culture may be obstacles.
With limited labor mobility, and the euro removing the other shock absorber (exchange-rate adjustments), great pressure will fall on those countries with the worst downturns.
This has led some economists to question whether the euro zone is a good idea at all, and to predict that, when confronted with a test of a severe differential recession, it will break apart. 
Low inflation, no currency risk, decreased transaction costs, and greater transparency have made the euro a success.
But the decreased flexibility in response to economic shocks will certainly test it.
At present, it is boldly highlighting the disparate, even discordant, fiscal responses now being embraced by European Union governments. 
This raises the old question about whether a currency union can work without a fiscal union, or at least stronger and more binding fiscal rules (the Maastricht deficit commitments are too easily breached).
To that we must add coordinated financial regulation and bailout policies, as deposits flow rapidly across borders in response to national guarantees and insurance in the euro zone.
Will the euro's second decade be as successful as the first?
The financial crisis and deepening recession have created many challenges.
The euro zone's less competitive economies are tethered to monetary policy (interest rates) set by the ECB, but pursue diverse approaches to bank bailouts and fiscal stimulus.
Italy and Greece, in particular, face serious debt issues amid financial market concerns about the possibility of default or their leaving the euro zone.
The gaps between German bond yields and Italian and Greek yields are at record levels.
The price of default insurance has tripled.
But the weaker economies get the inflation credibility of the ECB and protection from severe exchange-rate swings.
Indeed, avoiding continuous competitive devaluations is more a blessing than a curse.
On balance, that may even make membership more appealing for non-members such as Denmark and Poland.
Global Disaster Recovery
Countries' policy responses have ranged from modest to immense.
China has undertaken a 6%-of-GDP stimulus package aimed (mostly) at infrastructure; the United States has enacted a two-year $800 billion spending and tax rebate package.
The Federal Reserve and the Bank of England lowered short-term interest-rate targets to near zero and are adopting "quantitative easing" -- i.e., continuous infusions of money.
Despite all this, massive excess bank reserves remain unlent.
During Japan's "lost decade," the Bank of Japan mostly bought Japanese government bonds, whereas the Fed is trying to reopen secondary markets for securitized private lending (which in the US is as important as bank lending), buying mortgage-backed securities and consumer and business loans, as well as U.S. Treasury bonds.
The Bank of England is buying UK government bonds ("gilts").
The European Central Bank, reflecting a strong inflation concern, has responded more slowly.
The US government is now insuring, lending or spending over $10 trillion from guaranteeing money market funds to the AIG bailout to the Fed's swap lines supporting foreign central banks.
Analogous guarantees and bank bailouts have occurred in the other major economies (the ECB does not play this role for Europe; national governments do).
The fiscal response -- tax cuts and spending increases -- has varied considerably, being somewhat more tepid in debt-averse Europe than in the US and China.
The US is hectoring Europe for more fiscal stimulus, while the Europeans pressure the US for greater and more globally coordinated financial regulation.
Will near-zero interest rates, financial-sector bailouts, and fiscal stimulus work?
What else could be done?
As for fiscal measures, the empirical evidence suggests that three-quarters of consumption is based on longer-term economic prospects, not short-run disposable income.
Thus, temporary tax rebates are mostly saved, not spent.
Targeting liquidity-constrained people, especially the unemployed, is a bit more effective, as well as humane. 
Some claim that infrastructure spending creates a big Keynesian "multiplier," a bigger increase in incomes than the initial spending (estimates range up to about 1.5 times the initial increase in spending).
But infrastructure spending is usually slow -- and almost always driven heavily by parochial political considerations.
Japan's annual 15-20 trillion yen infrastructure-intensive stimulus didn't prevent its lost decade.
Nor did American government spending end the Great Depression (unemployment was still over 15% in 1939, a decade after the depression's onset).
A more effective stimulus would speed up spending that needs to be done anyway.  Or cut taxes to change the marginal calculus of firms on layoffs and consumers on spending -- for example, by suspending the payroll tax on firms and workers for a year or suspending part or all of the sales tax or national value-added tax.
Better yet would be permanent rate reductions and controls on future spending.
But governments should be wary of expensive fiscal stimulus.
It is likely to yield little cushion for employment and income per dollar spent, while servicing the large debt accumulation will impede long-run growth, either by forcing substantial future tax increases or spending cuts, or by forcing central banks to inflate.
Indeed, China frets over the safety of the US Treasury bonds that it holds.
In theory, enough quantitative easing implies future inflation, motivating people to buy big-ticket items, like cars and appliances, now to avoid the run-up in prices later.
(In practice, it is an experiment.)
High and rising inflation creates great costs and is difficult to reverse.
After mitigating the downturn, central bankers must withdraw the immense infusion of liquidity before inflation takes off, a tricky maneuver.
The bottom line, though, is that better policies can at best mitigate the economic consequences of this horrible recession.
We will not get out of this mess completely any time soon.
Sometimes, strong recoveries follow recessions, but recovery following financial crises is always immensely painful, time-consuming, and traumatic.
The economists Ken Rogoff and Carmen Reinhart have argued that the major financial crises of the last century typically lasted a half-decade or longer.
In many of the previous banking crises, it was a country or a region that was hit hard (Argentina, Japan, etc.).
This time, virtually every economy is suffering substantially and the banking crisis is global.
Policymakers will continue to throw whatever ammunition they can find at the problem, but it will take time for the deleveraging from the boom to run its course.
At times of serious economic distress, policymakers thrash about seeking solutions, and some people lose confidence in the economic system itself.
Indeed, in the Great Depression of the 1930's, it was common for Western intellectuals to turn to communism and central planning as a hoped-for panacea.
Some never returned from that intellectual journey, despite the collapse of communism.
There is, of course, no case for going back to socialism and central planning.
Once off government lifelines, we will need a better-regulated financial system.
Any financial institution that is too big or too interconnected to fail, or could quickly become so, must be closely regulated and monitored for risk and capital adequacy in real time, or be broken up into smaller firms.
In the meantime, let's hope that Messrs. Bernanke, King, Trichet, and the world's other central bank governors get monetary policy roughly right, and that our politicians don't waste vast sums on ineffective fiscal stimulus.
Grading Obamanomics
Obama outsourced the details of the $787 billion fiscal stimulus to Congress and, no surprise, the old barons of the House stuffed it with pork and social engineering.
Several months later, only 4%-6% of the funds have been spent, and the federal government is brow-beating state governments -- for example, demanding that California rescind a small pay cut for some unionized workers or lose $7 billion in stimulus funds.
(Intervening in contractual relations ex post to enforce union demands is an emerging characteristic of the administration).
The foreclosure relief plan is off to an even slower start, and is likely to run into numerous problems concerning how to rework delinquent mortgages without inducing a lot more delinquencies.
So score the stimulus a very expensive, largely wasted opportunity.
Instead, Obama could, for example, have suspended the payroll tax for a year, getting money directly into people's pockets quickly and decreasing the need for firms to lay off workers.
Obama's long-run budget calls for much higher spending, higher taxes, and an explosion of debt that will crowd out borrowing in capital markets by private companies, state and local governments, and developing countries.
Obama would add $6.5 trillion to the United States' national debt, more than all previous presidents, from George Washington to George W. Bush, combined.
That is in addition to explicit tax hikes on income, capital gains, and dividends, the implicit ones on energy via cap-and-trade, etc.
It appears that the Obama strategy is to "stuff the beast" (the mirror image of the tax-cutting "starve the beast" philosophy attributed to some of President Ronald Reagan's advisers), i.e., to initiate massive spending and hide the true cost from citizens.
The large deficits will eventually force much higher taxes, such as a national value-added tax similar to those in Europe, or gigantic increases in everyone's income taxes.
The Federal Reserve lowered its target federal funds rate to zero before Obama was inaugurated, and initiated many programs to try to revive credit markets, with mixed results (the commercial paper facility has helped, whereas others seem to have gotten off to less sanguine starts).
The Fed's independence is a key component of its anti-inflation credibility, and a key test for Obama will be to support the Fed's efforts to withdraw the liquidity before substantial inflation pressures assert themselves several years from now. 
The Obama administration also seems to be heading toward regulating derivatives and financial institutions deemed too big to fail.
America does need a clearinghouse for derivatives, and a much higher percentage of derivative trading should take place on exchanges, rather than bilaterally over the counter.
Any institution that is or could quickly become too big to fail needs to have adequate capital (rising with size), and real-time continuous monitoring of risk, but these measures should be implemented without overbearing micromanagement.
Unfortunately, the Obama administration's decision to put the unions ahead of secured debt-holders in the orchestrated Chrysler bankruptcy risks rupturing the basic fabric of credit markets.
But Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner's much-ridiculed bank "stress tests" made sense (although one can argue that sufficiently dire scenarios were not included or that too much was negotiated with the banks, etc.).
Determining the size of likely losses is necessary to decide whether banks' retained earnings from profitable ongoing operations and their ability to raise private capital will allow them to work down their toxic assets over time.
If not, more draconian solutions will be necessary. 
I support Geithner's plan to cooperate with private investors in dealing with the banks' toxic assets, because they make better business decisions than government bureaucrats.
But the Fed's low-interest, non-recourse loans to buy up toxic assets have not yet caused a stampede of participants.
Will banks be willing to part with the assets at a low enough price to attract private investment?
And would doing so force larger write-downs, requiring banks, in turn, to ration credit -- and thus harming the economy?
Obama has been better than feared on international trade.
He was famously protectionist during the primaries, declaring he would unilaterally rewrite NAFTA.
But, while he has continued his softer tone since the election, he has not even bothered to ask for fast-track trade-promotion authority, let alone try to pump new life into the Doha Round of global trade talks.
Obama is getting a large part of his agenda.
Unfortunately, the numbers don't add up and he is laying twin time bombs with the explosion of federal government debt and inefficient government micromanagement of the economy.
His call for immense deficits  even once the economy is back to normal, funds are returned from the financial bailouts, and the US is out of Iraq -- is simply irresponsible.
The American economy will likely return to growth late this year and next, especially with all the monetary and fiscal stimulus (growth would have initially been slower and then much stronger without it), but it will still be an economy on a government lifeline.
The big questions left unanswered are how far Obama wants to push the US toward a European-style social-welfare state, how he intends to pay for it, and how much long-term economic damage will result?
Of Banks and Bailouts
The financial system is a complex interaction of lenders and borrowers, buyers and sellers, and savers and investors.
When it functions well, it balances risk and reward, and innovation and safety.
Banks and other financial firms borrow short -- increasingly in recent years from the commercial securities market, not deposits -- and lend long at higher interest rates, taking on both credit risk (of default) and interest-rate risk.
Increasing leverage boosts returns on the upside but is very risky on the downside.
No surprise, then, that the large financial firms that failed -- Bear Stearns, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, AIG, and Lehman Brothers -- had the highest leverage, in the range of 30 or 40 times their capital. 
From 2002-2007, trillions of dollars were loaned for sub-prime and prime mortgages, autos, credit cards, commercial real estate, private equity, and more, on the assumption by (most) borrowers and lenders that strong global growth, rising home prices and cheap, readily available short-term credit would continue for the foreseeable future.
Once the music stopped, the assets plunged in value.
The complexity of securitized pools of loans that were sold worldwide -- bilaterally over the counter -- as pieces of various tranches, meant that nobody was certain about who owned what or what it was worth.
This difficulty in valuing the now so-called toxic assets remains at the core of today's credit difficulties.
The immense response by central banks and finance ministries has eased the strain.
The United States Federal Reserve's commercial paper facility was helpful in reopening the commercial paper market (although other of its facilities have been less successful).
The barometer of stress watched most closely by experts, the LIBOR-OIS (Overnight Indexed Swap) spread is down substantially from its stratospheric crisis levels.
Some government programs are shrinking from lack of demand.
But there remain little new securitization and bank debt offerings without government backup.
The original idea for the US government to buy up (some of the) toxic assets with the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) gave way to capital infusions (and auto bailouts).
Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner's new public-private investment program to buy toxic assets has few takers, despite subsidized non-recourse financing.  So the toxic assets remain on bank (and other) balance sheets.
Can banks generate enough profits for long enough to buy time to write down smaller losses and raise private capital later in a stronger economy?
Or are the losses so large -- and in danger of mounting further as others (such as commercial real estate) are added -- that a gradual workout is unlikely, if not impossible?
Estimates of the losses on US loans and securities range from under $1 trillion to almost $4 trillion.
The IMF puts them at $2.7 trillion, but the range of uncertainty is enormous.  More than half is held by banks and broker-dealers.
And analogous problems exist in Western Europe (e.g., for loans to Eastern Europe) and Asia.
Gradualism and profitability, and eventually US Brady bonds, worked in the Latin American debt crisis in the 1980's.
But a difficult economy will drive down the value of toxic assets and make more assets toxic.
For example, falling home prices put more families in negative equity -- mortgages worth more than the home.
This creates an incentive to default, which increases foreclosures and lowers the value of the mortgage-backed securities on financial firms' books.
Policymakers need a Plan B in the event that one proves necessary, modeled on America's rapid resolution of insolvent savings and loans in the early 1990s, together with sales of toxic assets in large blocks (to prevent so-called adverse selection from unraveling any bidding process).
History is instructive.
Of the $500 billion that America required for the Resolution Trust Corporation (equivalent to $1¼ trillion today), $400 billion was returned from asset sales, for a net cost of $100 billion, one-tenth the worst-case private forecasts of $1 trillion.
The final tab on the toxic mortgage bailout and other assets is likely to be a larger percentage of a larger amount, but still far less than the face value of the loans, because the underlying assets will in many cases retain considerable value.
In addition to bailouts and toxic asset plans, governments worldwide want central banks to monitor macroeconomic and overall financial-sector risk (as opposed to focusing on individual firms).
Barack Obama's administration would anoint the Fed, whose history has been to recognize crises late.
The Bank of England seeks similar powers.
The European Union wants to establish a European Systemic Risk Board composed of the national central bank governors, chaired by the European Central Bank.
What will these central bankers do to advise on macro-prudential risk?
Demand adjustments in large current-account imbalances?
Call for reductions in taxes, spending, and government debt, which are the primary systemic risks?
To do that could jeopardize monetary policy independence and heighten the threat of future inflation.
Dealing with financial institutions deemed too big to fail won't be easy.
The current system, which allows privatized gains from highly leveraged risk-taking but socializes losses in the event of failure, must be changed to avoid episodic financial meltdowns.
To balance the benefits of scale and scope with the socialized losses to taxpayers, firms deemed too big to fail should be required to have more capital, and the amount should rise disproportionately with size.
Converting some portion of debt to equity under predetermined solvency-threatening conditions would provide an extra layer of protection.
Add a higher bar for government bailouts, and these stronger incentives would induce private financial institutions and investors to take responsibility before disaster strikes.
Assisted dying -- from ‘Should we do it?' to ‘Who should do it?'
In the past, intentionally hastening the death of any person was always a crime, no matter the circumstances.
But public attitudes have been changing.
Assisting a person who has explicitly asked to die is increasingly being seen as a justifiable action, especially in the context of a terminal illness.
This is a consistent finding of opinion polls in westernized countries.
Still, legislative bodies are cautious when considering possible changes to the law.
So far only the Netherlands, Belgium, and the state of Oregon in the US have put explicit legislation into practice.
But serious political discussions on similar legal changes are taking place in many other countries, including the UK, South Africa and Australia.
As adamant opposition to the legal regulation of assisted dying weakens, so the issues of practical applicability become more important.
Of course there is the question of who qualifies for an assisted death.
Should it be only the terminally ill?
Should, for instance, the early stages of Alzheimer's disease qualify?
Or even any serious and incurable illness or disability?
And what about people whose reason for wanting to die is not related to their medical condition at all?
There is also another central question that has not yet been granted the attention it merits: who should actually take responsibility for the assistance?
In public discussions there is often a presumption that it is the task of the medical profession.
There are sometimes specific references to the Dutch practice that allows doctors to end their patients' lives if they explicitly ask for it, as long as certain preconditions of due practice are met.
Assistance in dying provided by a non-physician remains illegal.
In such a medicalized framework it is morally and legally almost irrelevant who finally administers the lethal drug: if physicians are closely involved, there is no reason why they should not administer the lethal drug themselves.
Although Belgium recently followed the Dutch way of regulating voluntary active euthanasia in a strictly medicalized framework, it is precisely this sort of regulation that is increasingly challenged.
Doctors have pointed out that, whilst recognizing that an increasing majority of the population wants such a service to be available, to hasten death intentionally is still inherently incompatible with the basic objectives of medicine.
In this respect, the Death with Dignity Act in Oregon is an interesting law.
Of course, any regulation in this field requires at least some involvement by a doctor but the Oregon Act recognizes the fundamental dilemma faced by doctors confronted with a patient's request to die and strives to keep that involvement to a minimum.
Oregon physicians may write a prescription for a lethal substance on the explicit request of a terminally ill patient, provided they can confirm the fatal prognosis, the patient's decision-making capacity, and have informed the patient about any feasible alternative such as hospice care or pain-control options.
Physicians are not required to be present at the suicide, and they are not allowed to administer the lethal drug.
In Oregon, the patient decides independently of the physician where and when he or she wants to die, or even at all.
Compassion in Dying, a right-to-die society and non-medical NGO, participates in a consultative way in most of these cases.
Interestingly, research on the rationales of people who have legally hastened their death under the Oregon Death with Dignity Act reveals that the fear of pain and other distressing symptoms was not a major concern in most cases.
Instead, issues of personal independence, retaining control and not becoming a burden to family, friends, or caregivers turned out to be the main reasons.
Recent developments in the Netherlands have also shown that euthanasia is discussed more in the context of autonomy, control, and rational choice rather than of uncontrollable medical symptoms.
The decision in such cases is based mostly on personal and social considerations rather than medical ones.
Given that this framework extends far beyond any medical expertise, it is not surprising that no medical association anywhere in the world has so far embraced the Dutch regulation.
Whilst the Dutch Medical Association does not oppose the profession's role in the practice of euthanasia, current evidence suggests a continuing unwillingness on the part of Dutch doctors to report cases of assistance in dying to the authorities, and a return to practices that are closer to a medical context, such as terminal sedation.
So there is great tension everywhere between how the public, and how doctors regard a possible contract in the field of assisted dying.
What is happening at the moment could be described as a power struggle over who should be responsible for a service that more and more people wish to be available but where no amount of professional expertise can fully safeguard the right decision.
At the same time, any wrong decision has far-reaching and irreversible consequences.
It has been said that assisted dying is pivotal to the discussion about what constitutes a good death; it is also a focal point in the relationship between the medical profession and society as a whole.
Europe Means Fair Play
As Ukraine's agonizing struggle for democracy continues, Europeans wonder if the politics of principle can ever eclipse the politics of power.
Is it naive to believe that the world amounts to more than zero-sum thinking?
Can Europe promote fair play in international affairs, or must it accept a new game of great power rivalry as inevitable and throw itself into the fray?
Many Europeans see themselves as champions of global fair play.
But Europe's opinion of its integrity is not always shared.
One example is Russia, which is skeptical about the EU's intentions, most recently over Ukraine.
That should not surprise us.
The EU has expanded from six members to 25, with Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia, and Turkey waiting in the wings.
Russia wants to know where the Union will stop.
Does it plan to swallow Ukraine, Belarus, and the Caucasus?
Most EU members view these as open questions, unlikely to be resolved soon.
The Kremlin, however, seems to see in such vagueness a smokescreen hiding the Union's true intentions, though the recent EU-Russia summit provided an opportunity to clear the air.
Nowadays, when the EU concludes agreements with non-EU countries, it includes all sorts of stiff requirements in areas like human rights, non-proliferation, readmission of migrants, and terrorism.
To countries on the receiving end, these conditions can seem like a subtle form of power politics, with Europe trying to impose its values on the world.
Indeed, for the EU some issues are non-negotiable, because they are pillars of the European model that we seek to share with the world.
These issues include democracy and the rule of law, respect for human rights and the environment, non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and the campaign against terrorism.
Countries cannot expect economic and other benefits from the Union unless they meet its political standards.
But are those standards really an imposition?
It looks as if the principles of fair play are increasingly embraced outside of Europe.
Consider Africa, where the African Union is taking a leading role in resolving conflicts on the continent and is increasingly determined to intervene to halt aggression and assure fair play for African minorities.
Even if the results on the ground in Africa don't yet look spectacular to outsiders, the change in attitude is real.
Instead of playing the "Great Power Game" in Africa, the EU can support Africans' own efforts and allow them to benefit from the Union's experience.
Europe's belief in fair play for all reflects its self-interest, at least in some ways, because the world's balance of power is changing.
Consider the rise of China and India.
The investment bank Goldman Sachs predicts that the dollar size of the Chinese economy will overtake that of Britain and Germany by 2007.
India will pull ahead of France by 2020 and surpass Germany by 2023.
As Asia's economies race forward, so do its political ambitions.
Asians want to assume greater responsibility in the world, and it is in Europe's interest that they do, as long as they, too, respect the rules of fair play.
A sense of fair play also matters within the Union.
The larger the EU gets, the greater its need for coordinated and coherent policies, and the harder it becomes to rally all members around a common position.
Call this the "paradox of enlargement."
The three largest member states -- Britain, France, and Germany -- have tended to respond to this paradox by pursuing closer trilateral cooperation.
Of course, there's nothing wrong with vanguard groups of members forging ahead -- the recent diplomatic initiative concerning Iran's nuclear program is a case in point.
Indeed, every member state can be expected to cling to its right to pursue an independent foreign policy for the foreseeable future.
The Union and the Dragon
This month, China and the European Union mark 30 years of official relations.
During that period, changes within China, and in the nature of those relations, have been dramatic.
But how will relations evolve over the next thirty years?
Will China and the EU be competitors or partners?
Many challenges face both China and the EU.
The first are economic.
China's development in recent years has been magnificent.
But speedy growth always incites turbulence, which China will have to minimize and manage.
As it integrates into the world economy, it must seek to sustain growth while protecting the environment and reducing poverty and inequality.
These are daunting tasks, and China cannot address them alone.
Indeed, sustainable development is a challenge for both China and Europe.
After all, by far the most important factor determining whether our children and grandchildren will enjoy secure, healthy, and productive lives is whether the world's natural ecosystems survive the pressures put on them by modern civilization.
A recent UN report warned that we have already entered the danger zone.
Numerous land and sea ecosystems are in danger of being destroyed forever, with effects that are hard to predict.
One downside to China's rapid growth is its rising demand for energy and the increased CO2 emissions that accompany it.
China is quickly turning into one of the world's largest importers of oil and gas.
The International Energy Agency's World Energy Outlook 2004 predicts that, between now and 2030, global demand for energy will rise by roughly 60%, with China and India accounting for nearly two-thirds of that increase.
Huge investments -- worth trillions of euros -- will be needed to meet global energy requirements.
The same report warns that, if we do not change our ways, worldwide CO2 emissions will rise exponentially.
So a new phase in international environmental cooperation is needed, with China's active contribution.
Of course, China clearly has a right -- like any country -- to seek the energy, minerals, and other resources it needs.
But a lack of cooperation could result in higher-than-necessary oil and gas prices and perhaps defeat in the battle against climate change.
This means that China must treat climate change and intelligent energy use as priorities in its national policies.
Beyond economics, China must reassure others that its awakening will not make the world tremble.
Thus, in formulating its policies, China must also sell those policies to a global audience.
Most Europeans believe that China wants to be a shaper of -- not a challenger to -- a balanced world order, a strong United Nations, and an effective multilateral system.
But, in a global village, misperceptions can arise all too easily -- and can do great damage.
China's important role concerning North Korea's nuclear ambitions is a good example of exercising responsibility for international security and stability.
The international community counts on China to pursue that role with vigor.
If necessary, it must use its influence even more assertively to bring Pyongyang back to the negotiating table.
Obviously, that solution must be in line with Chinese proposals and interests: a denuclearized Korean peninsula, which has the support of the EU.
Opportunities exist for a constructive Chinese role elsewhere.
Having concluded a ten-year energy agreement with Iran, China is in a position to support the EU's efforts to prevent nuclear proliferation, as the Union supports China's efforts concerning North Korea.
This is not just about Iran, but also about the threat of a nuclear arms race across the entire Middle East.
Chinese interests are served by a Middle East marked by regional cooperation.
We count on China's continued support for European and American efforts in making sure that Iran's nuclear program remains limited to purely civilian purposes.
Europe and the world are also watching China's handling of domestic human rights issues.
The EU welcomed the inclusion last year of the following clause in the Chinese Constitution: "The government respects and protects the human rights of the people." But it is deeds that matter.
At the EU-China Summit, we discussed the Chinese government's plans for ratification of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.
One subject China should address is freedom of belief.
The obligation of prior registration of religious communities is discriminatory.
Ratification of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights -- and the resulting changes in Chinese laws and practice -- would help to secure social and political stability in China, boost dialogue between China and the EU, and increase China's moral authority.
It is time to replace the old cooperation agreement between the Union and China, dating from 1985.
Our relationship has evolved from a predominantly economic one into one that includes fighting terrorism, piracy, and organized crime, as well as many other issues.
A structured dialogue -- including the private sector, which is so intimately involved in China's development -- is needed on energy, sustainable development, and the environment.
We must see environmental problems and energy scarcity for what they are: threats to mankind as a whole.
China will undoubtedly find the EU a tough negotiating partner.
The EU sets all kinds of conditions for cooperation with other countries.
Some issues are non-negotiable, because they are pillars of the European model that we seek to share with the world.
These include democracy and the rule of law, respect for human rights and the environment, non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery, and the campaign against terrorism.
The EU's political standards are high, but the fruits of cooperation are sweet.
If we tackle our common problems together, China and Europe can be instrumental in turning the twenty-first century into a century of hope.
Putin the Pleaser
MOSCOW: Russia's election campaign was a bore.
I wish I could explain that it was tedious because we are now a normal democratic country, a place where politics is mundane, not a matter of life and death.
But Russia is still another type of country. So a Russian election that seems Soviet in its utter predictability is not to be welcomed.
Fundamental issues remain unsettled; hard choices must be made.
Informed, consent is needed, and our democratic election did not provide it.
Voters were so bored that there was real doubt that the minimum 51% of all eligible voters would cast their ballots and thus make the election results valid.
Abstention on such a scale would at least have made the election interesting.
Outside Russia, of course, the world has been preoccupied by our so-called campaign, probably only because Russia's democracy still seem such a novelty.
As expected for months, Vladimir Putin won by a wide margin.
No longer is he "acting" president. Instead, Putin rules in his own right.
But what is his mandate?
No one knows for certain.
Hints as to the general tenor of his presidency can, perhaps, be found in discovering why Putin's star rose so meteorically.
Putin stands for change, inchoate change, but change nonetheless.
For Russians tired of Boris Yeltsin long ago.
From a crowd favourite, an idol of women and intellectuals, Yeltsin turned into a feeble old man who aroused pity.
People were sick of his "unpredictability", of his inability to control his temper or knock sense-- if not integrity--into the Kremlin's corrupt gang.
People held Yeltsin responsible for making Russia a global laughing stock, and were sick of his broken promises.
All of this makes Yeltsin a tragic figure.
He assumed responsibilities beyond his strength.
He undoubtedly saved the freedoms Gorbachev brought--freedom of choice, speech, the press, freedom of conscience. But he did not succeed in delivering real, sustainable freedom--the freedom to live in a responsible, safe, and stable state.
Under these circumstances, any presidential candidate chosen from Yeltsin's entourage seemed doomed.
But Putin, because of his non-Moscow and non-Kremlin background, was able to overcome his patron.
He was not perceived as a man from the Kremlin's ragged--through so many government reshuffles--pack of political cards.
He was not deemed a creature of the "family" (Yeltsin's trusted advisers, supporters and aids).
Putin's youth, his energy, his ability to talk in a language crowds understand, are the visible signs of the change he seems to promise.
More importantly, he is all things to all people.
Our intelligentsia loves him because he regularly attends theatre, opera, and ballet.
Economists cheer because he understands the free market.
Lawyers are happy; he promised to establish the "dictatorship of law."
Politicians from across the political spectrum endorse him because his political program runs the gamut from communism to liberalism.
Last but not the least, he is a man of the military and KGB.
Chechnya also announced his promise of change.
Although many view the second Chechen war as a conspiracy launched with the presidential election in mind, it was the Chechens who handed Putin, through their invasion of Dagestan in August 1999, a unifying cause and campaign theme.
Ever the opportunist, Putin caught the country's mood and staked his future.
He chose the "unity of Russia," and the "threat of Russia's disintegration" as the foundation of his politics and so "took on the noble task to crack down on all separatists."
Like the northern states that rallied to Abraham Lincoln during America's Civil War, most Russians genuinely supported Putin, for he did not hesitate to fight for "Russia's wholeness."
That decision also played well with Russia's wounded national pride, as it offered proof that Russia could act in its own interest, making tough decisions regardless of what the Western said.
Although re-conquering Chechnya focussed Putin's energy, the real prize was Russia and he kept his eyes on it.
The promise to strengthen the state, imposing discipline and order, as encapsulated in the Chechen War seemed to make Putin's presidential aspirations clear. The "dictatorship of law," the only kind of dictatorship Russia has never experienced in its history, is at the heart of his program and is the real source of his strength and popularity.
Russians like strong leaders, and everyone (especially the West) insists that Russia needs the rule of law.
Putin may be one of the few leaders ever to base his popularity on a promise to get tough.
Yet, despite his image as a hard man of the KGB, Putin is deft at pleasing people.
Indeed, his most astonishing attribute is intellectual flexibility, to say what everyone wants to hear.
Here Putin resembles a magic mirror.
Everyone who looks in it sees himself.
In a campaign, this is a useful quality, for it brings Putin close to everyone, to those who look forward and those who look back, to liberal democrats and ill-liberal conservatives, to nationalists, patriots, communists and independents, to federalists and confederalists.
Putin wears these many hats well.
But being all things to all people only works well only in a campaign.
Pursued in government, it can weaken.
Putin's rule must amount to more than popularity if he is to be successful.
So what will Putin provide Russia?
This is the mystery Russia faces, for after our boring campaign we left with only a guessing game.
This is just the opposite of what democracy should be. Campaigns should excite and point the way; governing is about the dull slog of detailed policies, and the effort to build enough support for necessary actions to enhance prosperity and freedom to take place.
Success here means opposing as much as pleasing.
To achieve results, Putin will have to stop pleasing everyone and start really governing.
Africa's Odious Debts
One side effect of the American/British occupation of Iraq is that it sparked public debate on a dark secret of international finance: the debts taken on by odious regimes.
As Iraq's new rulers debate what to do about the billions of dollars in foreign debts inherited from Saddam Hussein's regime, voices ranging from the charity Oxfam-International to US defence guru Richard Perle are calling for debt repudiation on the grounds that the debts Iraq now bears were contracted to sustain a corrupt, oppressive regime.
Iraq is not the only country burdened by such debts.
Across sub-Saharan Africa, many of the world's poorest people struggle with the crippling legacy of profligate lending to corrupt, oppressive rulers.
During his 32-year dictatorship, Congo's former president Joseph Mobutu accumulated a personal fortune estimated at $4 billion, while his government ran up a $12 billion foreign debt.
More of the same in Angola, where last year an IMF investigation revealed that $4 billion disappeared from Angola's treasury over the past five years.
It so happens that the Angolan government borrowed a similar sum from private banks in this period, mortgaging future oil revenues as security.
Much of Africa's ill-gotten wealth is now stashed abroad.
In a study of 30 sub-Saharan African countries, we estimate that total capital flight for the period 1970-1996 amounted to $187 billion.
Adding imputed interest earnings, the stock of Africa's capital flight stood at $274 billion - a sum equivalent to 145% of the debts owed by those countries.
In other words, sub-Saharan Africa is a net creditor to the rest of the world: its external assets exceed its external debts.
The difference is that the assets are private and the debts public.
Statistical analysis reveals that roughly 80 cents on every dollar borrowed by African countries flowed back as capital flight in the same year.
Foreign borrowing and capital flight were connected by a financial revolving door, as funds borrowed in the name of governments were captured by politically connected individuals and channeled overseas as their private wealth.
Moreover, every dollar added to a country's total debt generated 3 to 4 cents of extra capital flight per year in subsequent years, implying that capital flight was partly a response to the deteriorating economic environment associated with rising debt burdens.
In the last decade, sub-Saharan Africa recorded a "net transfer" (new borrowing minus debt service on past loans) of negative $11 billion.
That is, more money flowed out of Africa to creditors than returned as fresh lending.
The countries of the region spend more on debt service than on health.
Despite this haemorrhage, the debt burden grows ever larger.

But there is a remedy at hand.
The doctrine of "odious debt" dates from the end of the 19
Properly functioning financial markets require creditors to bear the consequences of imprudent lending.
The notion that lenders should always be repaid, regardless of how and to whom they lend, is indefensible.
The logic of sound banking tells us that current and future African governments should accept liability only for those portions of public debts that were incurred to finance bona fide domestic investment or public consumption.
Invoking the doctrine of odious debt, they could selectively repudiate that portion of the debt for which no such uses can be demonstrated.
This policy poses two practical problems.
The first is to determine who should bear the burden of proof in identifying which debts are "odious."
Given the evidence of widespread capital flight fueled by external borrowing, African governments can rightly insist that creditors have the responsibility of establishing that their loans were used for bona fide purposes.
If the fate of borrowed money cannot be traced, then they must infer that it was diverted into private pockets.
The second problem is that creditors may withhold new lending from governments that have the nerve to reject odious debts.
But today resources flow from Africa to creditors, rather than the reverse.
In the short run, African countries will save money by staunching this outflow.
In the long run, selective repudiation of odious debts will benefit both borrowers and creditors by promoting more responsible lending practices.
If Iraq's occupation gives impetus to legal challenges that free Africans from the burden of odious debts, then the war will have succeeded in dismantling at least one weapon of mass destruction.
Iraq's Potemkin Government
In the short term, there are good reasons to believe that the most powerful among Iraq's three main groups will do so.
But can any such government administer the country as a whole?
The answer to that question is likely to be no, which is why Iraq probably will be a much less stable place a year from now.
The new Iraqi government, when it is formed, will have at least the appearance of viability for the immediate future.
Shia have an interest in supporting the central government because they believe that their demographic weight (60% of Iraq's population) means that representative democracy will guarantee them the right to rule and protect them from Sunni demands and attacks.
Sunnis also will support the government, at least initially, because it represents their only opportunity to win what they consider their share of power, resources, and revenues.
Kurds will accept the arrangement because they believe that the new constitution guarantees their right to control most of the oil wealth that lies beneath their territory, and because they don't want the blame should Baghdad descend into chaos.
There is another reason Shia, Sunnis, and Kurds won't move immediately to undermine federal authority: the central government in Baghdad won't have the legal or economic means to challenge their local power.
In essence, while all of Iraq's factions have a strong interest in promoting a central government that appears fully functional, that government's powers will in fact be limited.
But, in the longer term, those limits on federal power will push Iraq toward a sectarian scramble for power and revenue.
Article 11 of the new constitution declares that "All that is not written in the exclusive powers of the federal authorities is in the authority of the regions."
That formulation all but pits the central government and regions against one another in a battle for political supremacy.
Similarly, under current law, soldiers will answer not to Baghdad but to regional powerbrokers, while the Iraqi constitution guarantees local governments the right to pocket the revenue that flows from new oil fields within their jurisdiction.
In fact, although the central government has the authority to collect the revenues generated by existing fields, there is no law to prevent local officials from modernizing old sites and claiming that they are new.
The impact of this state of affairs can hardly be overestimated.
Oil accounts for about 98% of Iraq's current export revenue.
It is the lifeblood of Iraq's economy and the source of the money that the central government will need to build durable institutions.
Although inflows of international financial assistance remain substantial, reconstruction money from abroad will begin to dry up as Iraq puts its central government in place.
In sum, the national government will lack both the authority and the means to govern Iraq.
Indeed, with Shiite-Sunni violence already intensifying, the Iraqi government may not be able to maintain even the appearance of effectiveness for very long.
Moreover, the Kurds are the proverbial dog that hasn't yet barked.
They enjoy relative economic prosperity, and their political institutions are growing more effective and efficient.
Thus, for the moment, they have no reason to challenge the status quo.
But this stability will face new challenges in 2006.
Gubernatorial elections this November will force Kurdish political contenders to offer opposing programs, and some candidates will seek electoral advantage via populist calls for independence.
At the same time, cooler heads will struggle to postpone a potentially divisive 2007 referendum on the final status of the oil-rich city of Kirkuk.
In fact, the friction generated by electoral politics is likely to stoke resentments within Shia and Sunni communities as well.
There is a great danger that the new Iraq's sectarian politics will benefit those who promise their constituents the most -- at the expense of the central government and the country's other factions.
Debates over possible constitutional amendments intended to pacify angry Sunnis and to de-fang the insurgency are likely to incite factional hostility as well.
More worryingly, when Shia, Sunnis, and/or Kurds decide that their elected officials are not delivering the promised perks and protections, they are likely to look beyond politics to advance their individual interests.
Some Shia may turn to militia leaders, Sunnis to insurgents, and Kurds to leaders demanding independence.
At that point, the future of an independent Iraq itself will be called into question.
Any separatist moves by Kurdish leaders would bring Turkey into Iraqi politics.
At the same time, the protection that American forces offer Iraqi officials will diminish as troops are gradually withdrawn, and Iran will race to fill the security vacuum.
In sum, the Iraqi government may appear effective for much of 2006, but it will be committed to trying to serve the competing interests of sharply divided constituencies.
The central government's weakness, continued insurgent violence, growing Iranian influence in Baghdad and with Shiite powerbrokers in the south, and the natural progression of sectarian politics suggest that the new Iraq will be markedly less stable as the year draws to a close.
The America that Can Say No
Some observers cite these episodes as evidence of decline in America's international clout.
But there's a larger point: so far, except for relatively small sums offered to the Kyrgyz, Russia and China haven't offered much help.   
Amid much talk of a "post-American world," many observers see a shift from a US-dominated international order toward a multipolar system, in which countries like China, Russia, and several others compete for global leadership on a range of common challenges and risks.
More than five years ago, China's President Hu Jintao proclaimed that, "the trend toward a multipolar world is irreversible and dominant."
When Vladimir Putin complained during a conference in Munich last year that US unilateralism stoked conflict around the world, an offended Senator John McCain responded that confrontation was unnecessary in "today's multipolar world."
When Putin welcomed Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez to Russia last September, he observed that, "Latin America is becoming a noticeable link in the chain of the multipolar world that is forming." Chávez agreed: "A multipolar world is becoming reality."
All of them have it wrong.
US dominance is clearly on the wane, but a multipolar order implies that several emerging powers hold competing views about how the world should be run, and that they are prepared to act to advance their global agendas.
That is not the case.
Instead, we are witnessing the birth of a non-polar order, in which America's chief competitors remain too busy with problems at home and in their immediate neighborhoods to shoulder the heaviest international burdens.
None of the emerging powers has even begun to use its growing political and economic clout to advance truly global ambitions -- or to take on responsibilities that Washington can no longer afford.
Start with Russia.
Despite its growing ties with Venezuela and efforts to coordinate energy policy with natural gas-rich countries in North Africa, the Kremlin has no aspirations to rebuild Soviet-scale influence in Latin America, Africa, or Southeast Asia.
Nor does it have Soviet-style ideological appeal.
Instead, Russia's leaders are busy protecting Russian markets, banks, and companies from the worst effects of the global financial crisis, consolidating state control over domestic economic sectors, and extending their foreign-policy leverage across former Soviet territory.
China's need to satisfy its hunger for imported oil and other commodities has given it an international presence.
But its influence is more commercial than political.
China's leaders must devote their attention to a staggering array of pressing problems at home: averting an economic slowdown that could push millions out of work and into the streets, the fallout from rural land reform, and efforts to manage enormous environmental and public health problems.
India must hold its own in China's lengthening shadow.
Facing elections next year, the ruling Congress Party is spending the government's time and money on subsidies for consumers, wage hikes for state employees, and debt relief for farmers.
Brazil is similarly preoccupied, appearing to have no grander near-term aspirations than to promote stability in Latin America, manage the effects of the global financial crisis, and inspire others in the developing world.
In short, there is a vacuum of global leadership just at the moment when it is badly needed.
President Barack Obama's attention is now concentrated on stimulating the anemic US economy, crafting tax cuts, reforming energy and health-care policies, and restoring confidence in US financial institutions.
The European Union continues its internal debate over how best to bail out its failing banks and industries, handle the fallout from EU and euro-zone expansion, and manage increasingly rocky relations with Russia.
Who, then, can take the lead on efforts to create a new global financial architecture that reflects the complexities of twenty-first-century commerce?
Who can drive consensus on a multilateral response to climate change?
Who will replace an obsolete nonproliferation regime, provide collective security in emerging international hotspots, and build momentum behind Middle East Peace talks?
The international summit meeting in Washington in November 2008 underlined the problem.
The world's richest countries (the G7) turned to the emerging powers within the G20 to help coordinate a response to the global financial slowdown.
Difficult as it is for seven countries to agree on anything, imagine the challenge of building consensus among 20.
Consider the competing views within this group on democracy, transparency, the proper economic role of government, new rules of the road for financial markets and trade, and how best to ensure that the United Nations, International Monetary Fund, and the World Bank fairly reflect today's global balance of power.
For the next several years, when those in crisis turn to the US for help, they are increasingly likely to hear the word no.
And it is not at all clear that anyone else is willing and able to say yes.
Capitals of Capital
Like the financial crisis itself, this trend is now global.
Political leaders in dozens of countries are making decisions that will drive the performance of local (and global) markets for the foreseeable future.
In China, exports fell by more than 25% in February.
Not to worry, said Premier Wen Jiabao: the Chinese government has "adequate ammunition" to add to its $586 billion stimulus package, a plan meant to create millions of jobs via enormous government investment in transportation, energy infrastructure, housing, and other large-scale projects.
In India, where government is more often considered a drag on commerce than a catalyst of growth, the decisions that move local markets are now more likely to come from bureaucrats in Delhi than from innovators in Mumbai.
In fact, the Congress Party-led government, anxious to appear responsive to public demand for help during an election-year economic slowdown, has pushed forward three stimulus packages since December.
The bottom line: to find out how, when, and where assets will be allocated and wealth generated in dozens of countries across the developed and developing worlds these days, we must now look toward political, not financial, capitals.  
This trend will spell trouble for longer-term global economic growth.
First, it's tough enough for leaders within the Chinese Communist Party elite to agree on economic-policy priorities.
The challenges facing US President Barack Obama as he tries to win support for risky and expensive policy options from quarrelsome Democrats and obstinate Republicans will create some tortured legislative compromises.
That pattern is being repeated elsewhere.
In Russia, Ukraine, Hungary, Pakistan, Turkey, Malaysia, Mexico, Nigeria, and other states, battles among domestic political factions will yield often-incoherent responses to pressing economic problems.
Second, if it's difficult to forge consensus within one country on how best to promote growth, imagine the same argument on a global scale.
Most politicians craft policy to serve their local constituents and to protect their personal political capital.
Reinvigorating global growth runs a distant second.
In Washington, many Democrats will use these policy debates to capitalize on popular fury at Wall Street, while many Republicans look for an opening to capitalize on hoped-for public anger at the Democrats.
Some within the Chinese Communist Party leadership will support plans to engineer a shift from export-led growth to a model based on domestic consumption.
Others will try to direct state funding toward their personal investment projects.
Factions within the Russian, Indian, Mexican, and South African governments have their own competing political priorities.
With so many political officials crafting crisis responses to solve local problems or to create local opportunities, how likely are they to agree on a unified international approach?
Our first glimpse of the trouble in coordinating an international response to the financial crisis came last November, during the emergency G-20 summit in Washington.
To get the G-8 to agree on priorities is a complicated enough; building consensus within the G-20 is exponentially more difficult, not simply because of the larger number of players involved, but because many of them don't agree on the most basic rules of the global economic game.
While the April G-20 summit in London produced more economic-policy agreement than expected, this was largely because the most divisive issue -- the US and British demand for more global stimulus spending -- was removed from the table beforehand.
As a result, the smiling presidents and prime ministers could afford to be more diplomatic than Czech Prime Minister Mirek Topolanek, who, in his role as acting president of the European Union, had warned that Obama's economic plan would lead others down a "road to hell."
Topolanek wasn't at the G-20; his country is not a member.
And, while British Prime Minister Gordon Brown agrees with Obama that the world's leading industrialized countries must stimulate their domestic economies as much as they can, Bank of England Governor Mervyn King has warned that Britain may already have taken on too much debt for another round of stimulus.  
However frightening the global recession, a coordinated and coherent response to it by the world's political leaders remains highly uncertain at best.
And the increasingly heavy influence of political factors on market performance will likely weigh on global growth for years to come.
Should the Troops Come Home Now?
Bush waited weeks for a positive development that would allow him to suggest he can reduce troop levels in Iraq from 133,000 to 100,000 by the end of 2006.
Blair, still stung by his Labour Party's defeat in local elections in early May, also welcomed the good news from Iraq.
During a triumphal surprise visit to Baghdad on May 22, he said he expected Iraqi forces to take responsibility for "territorial security" in much of the country by the end of the year. "It is the violence that keeps us here," he said.
"It is the peace that allows us to go."
The optimism is premature.
The formation of a unity government is only the first of many hurdles Iraq's new government must clear if it is to build a durable peace.
Its first task will be to remove those provisions of Iraq's constitution that pit Iraq's Sunni, Shia, and Kurds against one another.
Under current Iraqi law, the parliamentary committee charged with making these constitutional changes has four months to complete its task.
The four-month clock began ticking on May 3, following the first meeting of Iraq's new parliament.
The changes are badly needed.
The committee must enact a new hydrocarbon law that guarantees each of Iraq's factions a fair share of the country's oil wealth, which accounts for 97% of total export revenue.
Under the current constitution, local governments have the right to exploit (and profit directly from) oil extracted from new sites beneath their territory, while only a share of the income from existing sites must go to Iraq's central government.
On May 15, two small independent energy companies (Turkey's Genel Enerji and Canada's Addax Petroleum) became the latest foreign firms to begin drilling in Kurdish-controlled territory under an agreement with the regional government.
Kurdish politicians within the new parliament have good reason to protect these lucrative deals as debate begins over constitutional changes.
But the central government will need a large share of that income if it is to finance the construction of new institutions of governance, invest in critical infrastructure, undertake onerous reforms aimed at economic liberalization, and provide the resource-poor (and already restive) Sunnis of central Iraq with a greater share of the country's wealth.
The constitution must also be amended to reverse the worst effects of a de-Baathification process that aimed to dismantle the vestiges of Saddam Hussein's regime.
In practice, de-Baathification has excluded thousands of Iraqis -- most of them Sunnis who joined the party during the Saddam era only to secure good jobs -- from the country's political and economic life.
Finally, the Iraqi government must begin dismantling the militia groups that still outgun the fledgling Iraqi army, and it must defeat the largely Sunni-led insurgency.
Each of these tasks is formidable.
If Bush and Blair prematurely withdraw large numbers of the troops that support Iraqi stability, the country's new government would have little chance of success.
There is some reason for optimism that efforts to stem the tide of violence can succeed.
Media reports of Iraqi bloodshed focus overwhelmingly on Baghdad -- where the large majority of foreign journalists are based -- creating the impression that the desperate security situation there is representative of the country as a whole.
But in the Kurdish-controlled areas of the north and Shiite-dominated provinces in the south, levels of crime and deadly violence compare favorably with those in many cities in the United States.
But attacks in Iraq's "Sunni triangle" (and Baghdad in particular) occur at a rate rivaling those in Chechnya and the Niger Delta.
Since Sunni militants destroyed the Shiite Askariya mosque in February, hundreds of Iraqis have been killed in a series of tit-for-tat sectarian attacks.
Tens of thousands have fled from mixed Sunni-Shiite cities to safer havens in ethnically homogenous enclaves that are effectively controlled by Sunni and Shiite militias.
Only the presence of foreign troops slows the further balkanization of the country's already fractious politics.
That's why the temptation for Bush and Blair to limit further political damage at home by prematurely declaring victory in Iraq is so dangerous.
If they use the good news to begin withdrawing significant numbers of the foreign troops who bolster Iraq's stability at a crucial and vulnerable moment, they will have undermined the project to which both have devoted so much political capital.
And they will leave the new Iraqi government at the mercy of forces that would eventually pull the country apart.
Learning from Mexico
On September 1, dozens of opposition lawmakers created a primetime spectacle inside Mexico's parliament by occupying the speaker's podium, thereby denying outgoing President Vicente Fox the chance to deliver his final state of the nation address in person.
Four days later, Mexico highest electoral court ruled that Fox had improperly interfered in the election but unanimously reaffirmed Calderon's victory.
Lopez Obrador has vowed to obstruct Calderon's presidency from the moment he takes office on December 1.
You learn a lot about a country's underlying stability by how it responds to a crisis.
Similar electoral conflicts unfolded in the United States in 2000 and in Ukraine in 2004.
In the wake of fiercely contested presidential elections, large numbers of voters in each country questioned the legitimacy of the outcome.
The nation's highest courts were compelled to rule on demands for a ballot recount.
But US political and economic stability was never in doubt in 2000, because public confidence in the country's governing institutions allowed them to resolve the conflict peacefully.
These institutions proved far more powerful than the political personalities involved.
In Ukraine, on the other hand, public outrage, buttressed by international pressure, brought the government to a halt.
In a second vote, the election's loser was crowned the winner.
But the initial euphoria that accompanied the so-called "Orange Revolution" quickly faded, and Ukraine is still dealing with the political and economic fallout.
What, then, should we make of Mexico and its disputed election?
Here, too, a large segment of the electorate told pollsters that they doubted the legitimacy of the official result.
The judiciary rejected calls for a full recount, though they did examine roughly 9% of the ballots before ruling that the review indicated no challenge to the election's outcome.
Like Ukraine's Viktor Yushchenko, who lost the initial vote in Ukraine, Lopez Obrador demanded that the result be overturned.
Unlike Yushchenko, he was denied.
But the good news for Mexicans is that their country's political institutions have proven far more stable than did Ukraine's.
Despite Lopez Obrador's best efforts to create chaos in the streets with public demonstrations involving hundreds of thousands of protesters, domestic and international confidence remains strong.
The peso has barely budged since the election—a clear indication that investors have not lost faith in the country.
Their resilience is important, because market fears of instability often become a self-fulfilling prophecy.
The point is not that public confidence (or lack thereof) in an election outcome doesn't matter.
It does.
But the broader picture -- whether, as in Mexico, a country is able to continue to go about its business as its political institutions sort out the mess -- matters far more.
Unlike in Ukraine, investors have shrugged off the noisy demonstrations in Mexico City's streets and remained focused on interest rates and fluctuations in the global economy.
This suggests that governing principles and sturdy political institutions, not powerful individuals, have become the bedrock of Mexican governance.
Indeed, while Lopez Obrador continues to denounce the outcome and has threatened to make Mexico ungovernable, Mexico's growing middle class has taken the political conflict in stride.
Many who supported Lopez Obrador's candidacy do not support the post-election protests in his name.
A recent poll in the newspaper Reforma found that Calderon would now defeat him by 19 percentage points.
Voters may prefer Lopez Obrador, but they value Mexico's stability above all.
Moreover, during the political standoff, Calderon has worked behind the scenes to form an administration and to settle on a governing strategy.
Aware that he must establish a greater sense of political legitimacy, his cabinet is likely to include representatives of other political parties.
He will probably introduce measures to tackle poverty and create jobs.
The underlying stability highlighted by Mexico's post-election crisis is also evident elsewhere in Latin America.
Whatever the potential for a leftward shift this year in some Latin American countries, others, including Mexico, Chile, and Brazil, are clearly less vulnerable to the type of populist rule we've seen in Venezuela and Bolivia.
Elected leaders in these countries face institutional constraints -- parliaments that check the powers of the executive and courts that check the powers of both -- on their ability to shape policy.
To be sure, political and market volatility in a broad range of emerging-market economies will continue.
But some of them appear to have "graduated" toward a stability rooted in sustainable governance.
Beyond Latin America, several Eastern European countries offer ready examples.
In these states, regulatory and taxation issues now affect confidence more deeply and consistently than does political tension.
Many in the media may not comprehend that yet.
But markets do.
Though Mexico's election saga may continue to make headlines, its true significance is that it reveals just how politically sturdy a place Mexico has become.
Defusing Iran's Oil Weapon
What, then, can the US do to undermine Iran's position?
As the world's fourth largest oil exporter, Iran has profited mightily from the tripling of global oil prices over the last four years.
Its economic stability is dependent on oil revenues, so it is here that Iran's rulers are vulnerable.
American diplomats are never going to persuade the UN Security Council to impose sanctions on Iran's energy exports.
But the Bush administration can seek ways to contain global energy prices -- and it should begin by refusing to be baited into escalating tensions whenever Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad pleases.
Ahmadinejad has proven resourceful in driving the diplomatic conflict.
His government has rejected international calls to halt uranium enrichment, ignored UN-imposed deadlines, armed Iraqi militias, supplied Hezbollah with weapons for attacks on Israel, denied the Holocaust, and staged military exercises near the Strait of Hormuz, through which 40% of the world's sea-traded oil passes.
All these provocations add upward pressure on oil prices, enriching the Iranian government.
When Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei hinted that Iran could play the oil card, US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice dismissed the idea. "Let's just remember that Iran is some 80% dependent on oil in its budget," she said, so it is "not really able to live with a disruption."
But if Iran pulls modest amounts of its oil from international markets, price increases are likely to offset (perhaps completely) any loss in revenue from the supply cut.
In addition, threats to the Strait of Hormuz would allow Iran to force prices up without any reduction in output.
It is not an accident that virtually every public move Iran's government has made in the international arena over the past year has added risk to energy markets.
At times, the US has effectively -- if unintentionally -- undercut Iran's position.
This summer, the Bush administration offered Iran direct talks.
In September, Bush made an unexpectedly low-key speech to the UN General Assembly.
Resistance to sanctions from Russia, China, and France has persuaded US officials to "allow more time for diplomacy" before pushing for punitive action in the Security Council.
All of these choices helped return slack to energy markets.
Oil prices have fallen from above $78 per barrel in mid-July to less than $60 in early October.
The drop -- due in no small measure to an easing of tensions over Iran's nuclear program -- is costing the Iranian government money, compounding the regime's domestic problems.
Inflation in Iran is rising, perhaps to as high as 20%.
On October 1, Khamenei called on Ahmadinejad to address the growing problem.
There are price freezes on certain subsidized goods and services, and rising inflation makes these subsidies even more expensive for the government.
Indeed, the government indicates that it may begin rationing gasoline.
Unemployment stands at about 12%, and is probably twice as high among young people.
The US can undermine the Iranian regime by avoiding statements and actions that help drive energy prices higher and bolster Iran's economy.
Administration officials should lower the political temperature.
They should again offer Iran direct talks.
Bush should invite Ahmadinejad to Washington.
Better yet, invite him to Crawford.
Make him breakfast.
Washington can also press the Saudis, who control virtually all of the world's spare capacity, to keep their output high to contain prices.
Saudi Arabia's ruling Sunnis are more threatened than is the US by Iran's support for a shift in the regional balance of power toward Shia Muslims.
Yes, Ahmadinejad will probably find a way to re-escalate the conflict.
No one can stop Iran from threatening the Strait of Hormuz.
But no one can blame the US for that when Bush is offering to talk.
Iran probably needs two or three years to develop a nuclear weapon.
How strong will Ahmadinejad's domestic position be then?
If the US does not provide him with threats that help rally domestic support, his failure to revitalize Iran's economy will erode his standing at home.
Lower oil prices would mean less money to spend on domestic projects that buoy his popularity -- or on the nuclear program.
If cutting into Iran's oil income fails to weaken Ahmadinejad, the US would retain military options.
But undermining his domestic standing by limiting Iran's revenues stands a better chance of succeeding than diplomatic efforts to persuade the regime to suspend uranium enrichment voluntarily, or coercive sanctions.
Easing tensions will not win Bush points with those who prefer a muscular strategy.
But the administration's confrontational approach is failing, because it is precisely what Iran's rulers want.
Is Bush Right?
At the heart of the new strategy is Bush's decision to take the fight directly to Iraq's most powerful militia, the Mahdi Army.
Under the nominal control of the militant cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, the group has become Iraq's largest and best-armed fighting force and is pursuing its own political and security agenda.
The Mahdi Army has exchanged fire with US troops before, most notably during the fierce battles for control of the southern Iraqi cities of Najaf and Karbala in 2004.
Those confrontations ended with a truce of sorts -- though skirmishes have continued -- because US forces have been reluctant to fight Sunni insurgents and Shi'a militiamen at the same time.
Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki has also been reluctant to take on the Mahdi Army, mainly because the support of Sadr loyalists in Iraq's parliament is crucial for his political survival.
Now, instead of waiting for Maliki to act, US forces appear poised to do the job themselves.
If they can significantly degrade the militia's strength, or at least contain its influence within Baghdad's Shi'a slums, the Iraqi government will have a somewhat better chance of developing a credible security force and Bush can claim some success.
At the very least, the new strategy recognizes that the gravest challenge to stability in the near term comes from militia groups in general and the Mahdi Army in particular.
Then there is the broader and growing conflict with Iran.
Recent official US rhetoric and actions on the ground -- including the arrest of five Iranians in Irbil in early January and Bush's authorization of deadly force against Iranians who threaten Iraqi security or US troops -- reflect a much more confrontational approach toward Iran's influence inside Iraq.
But it also indicates recognition that Iran's effort to extend its regional influence poses the single biggest challenge to the Middle East's long-term stability.
To be sure, Bush's new strategy is highly unlikely to help Iraqis avert a slide into sectarian civil war.
A temporary 16% boost in troops simply is not enough to get that job done.
Bush insists that there will soon be enough US troops in central Iraq to "hold" areas seized from militia groups and insurgents.
But for how long?
A month?
Four months?
Three years?
American troops will eventually leave Iraq, and all the relevant parties -- the Maliki government, Shi'a militias, Sunni insurgents, Iran, and Iraq's Sunni Arab neighbors -- know it.
Sadr can simply hold back and wait the Americans out.
Moreover, any viable solution in Iraq requires political agreement among Iraqis, which in turn will depend on their willingness to compromise.
Laws guaranteeing a fair division of Iraqi oil profits must be drafted, and all factions must have confidence that what is agreed will be enforced.
Sunnis must be persuaded that neither their minority status nor former membership in Saddam Hussein's Ba'ath Party will exclude them from political and economic life.
But Sunnis and Shi'a are now killing one another in increasing numbers, and the new aggressiveness of US forces will make compromise all but impossible.
It is unrealistic to expect Iraqi politicians to make substantial political sacrifices while their constituents are fighting Americans and one another.
Finally, Bush's strategy already faces challenges at home.
Few Americans -- and therefore few US lawmakers -- have much confidence in Bush's leadership on Iraq.
If the new strategy fails to produce positive and tangible results within a few months, the steady domestic drumbeat for troop withdrawals will become deafening.
A sharp spike in US casualties would compound the pressure to get out.
Even so, the new strategy has some benefits.
First, it sidelines Maliki, which means that he will be less damaged politically than if he were directly identified with US attacks on Iraqi Shi'a.
US actions will spark Iraqi criticism that Maliki is impotent or an American puppet, but those charges have already been made.
Nothing could be worse for Maliki than explicit authorization for attacks on Shi'a militias, and the near-term survival of his government is crucial if any progress is to be made on the political challenges facing all of Iraq's factions.
Second, the new strategy will keep the Mahdi Army on its heels.
Sadr's militia threatens to quickly become Iraq's answer to Hezbollah: a well-armed, politically connected private army with its own foreign policy.
The more that US forces can degrade the Mahdi Army's position and force Sadr into face-saving political moves, the weaker the militia will be relative to other forces in Iraq after US troops head home.
Finally, taking the fight directly to Iraq's most powerful Shi'a militia and Iranians inside Iraq will align the US much more closely with its traditional Sunni Arab allies -- Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, and the Gulf states.
Arab governments have been especially angry over the chaos in Iraq, fearing that the US will abandon the Sunni minority to the not-so-tender mercies of revenge-minded Shi'a and expressing growing anxiety that the war has empowered Iran to extend Shi'a influence throughout the Middle East.
When Iraq falls apart, as now appears all but inevitable, the US will need as many friends in the region as it can get, particularly as the battle with Iran for regional influence and the conflict over its nuclear program intensifies.
If nothing else, having a common enemy will help the US and its Arab allies restore damaged ties.
Genetics' Next Frontier
In 1974, I published a paper entitled "The genetics of Caenorhabditis elegans ," also known as the nematode.
Its first sentence read: "How genes might specify the complex structures found in higher organisms is a major unsolved problem of biology."
This remains true today.
How do genes build organs, bones, or skin and specify their function?
Has our slowness in finding out been due to our difficulties in choosing the right organism to study?
Until the early 1960's, biology's great-unanswered question was far more modest: how does DNA determine the simplest of proteins?
But then it became clear that all you have to do is get a gene and sequence it, get a protein and sequence it, and simply translate one into the other.
In principle, we could learn what genes do just by reading their chemical language.
Of course we didn't have the right tools at the time.
We did have primitive tools to sequence proteins, so we could figure out their chemistry.
But we could not tackle the chemistry of genes.
All we could do was follow the standard--and painfully slow--procedure established by Gregor Mendel, the 19 allele .
For example, Mendel could not say that there was a gene for tallness in a plant species until he discovered dwarf mutants of the same species.
This approach defines genes according to an organism's observable characteristics.
Fortunately, technological progress lets us define genes much faster than Mendel could.
With the discovery of genetic recombination in viruses that penetrate rapidly reproducing bacteria, it became possible to measure variation in offspring much more minutely, and thus to dissect the fine structure of a gene.
So it was natural by this point for biologists to ask whether a similar approach would crack the genetics of more complex, multi-cellular organisms.
The rule from the earlier research on bacteria was to obtain mutants and study them as deeply as possible.
I was interested in the nervous system, and thought it important to study it in a way that it could be summarized in the form of a wiring diagram.
The plan was not to trace genes directly to behavior, but to separate the problem into two questions: a developmental question ("how do genes build nervous systems?"), and a physiological question ("how do nervous systems or brains generate behavior?").
The idea was to study mutants of C. elegans in the hope of finding mutants of genes that regulate behavior.
But even in an organism as simple as C. elegans , our technological limits made it extremely difficult to pinpoint the function of genes.
We started by studying muscle, simply because it gave us large amounts of proteins.
The invention in the mid-1970's of technology to clone and sequence DNA opened new vistas for research, and its use on humans and other mammals has been enormously successful in terms of scientific discovery.
But the development of genetics has remained dependent on the ability to study model organisms like C. elegans and Drosophila (the fruit fly).
In fact, the great risk nowadays is that with so many genetic descriptions of organisms pouring out, we are drowning in a sea of data but are moving further away from understanding biological complexity.
The basic functional units of all complex living organisms, it should be remembered, are cells , not genes.
Russia's Manipulative Media
MOSCOW: Today, there are no political parties in Russia, only mass media.
This is the little noticed result of the last parliamentary and presidential elections.
To be sure, the press is powerful in most democracies and often influences the ways in which political messages are read by the public.
But in more developed systems, political programs and ideas are ultimately the work of political parties and politicians -- what people ultimately vote for or against.
In Russia, the media don't "mediate"; they are the very source of Russia's political ideas.
Russian voters vote don't vote a party line, they vote the mass media line.
Last summer there was little doubt that the coming parliamentary elections would make the Luzhkov/Primakov Fatherland-All Russia party (OVR) the biggest fraction in the Duma.
After the vote on December 19, OVR was not even runner up: it came third, with 13% of the vote and 46 out of 450 seats in the Duma.
Similarly, no one doubted last July that the next President would be either ex-prime minister Primakov or Moscow's mayor Luzhkov.
All that was left to guessing was which of the two would agree to be prime-minister in the other's presidential administration.
When the presidential election occurred, however, neither man was anywhere to be seen.
What happened to OVR, supposedly the new party of power?
What happened to Primakov and Luzhkov?
Did they change their political positions?
Did OVR commit some huge political blunder that finished them off?
They were destroyed, not by themselves or their unpopularity with voters, but by the mass media.
That same mass media also created a new idol who has now swept all before him.
A new inter-regional movement, Unity, founded only in September ‘99, dominated the parliamentary elections last December on a platform that could be summarized in two words: Vladimir Putin.
From then on the presidential election was a yawn: the only (not very exciting) question was whether Putin would need one or two rounds to switch from being the "acting" to the "elected" holder of the highest office.
In the wake of Putin's personal juggernaut, Unity also lapsed into desuetude.
To understand what happened, we need to look beyond politics and into the psychological makeup of Russian voters.
Only two groups of Russians today show some resistance to the all-powerful sway of the media.
The first -- around 30% of the voting population -- is made up of political extremes, mostly hard core communist supporters for whom "party discipline"and unqualified hatred of everything since the Soviet Union's collapse trumps all other considerations.
Included in this 30% is a also sprinkling of right-wing nationalists who look at post-1991 history as a vast anti-Russian conspiracy.
The other group less subject to informational hypnosis are young people.
By and large, the new generation, grown to adulthood after 1991, has its own mind and does not look at every published word as if it was revealed truth.
But in what is perhaps the most damning failure of democracy in Russia, the young are politically apathetic and refuse to vote or actively participate in politics.
The rest of the Russian public is held in thrall by TV and the press.
How?
After all, the Russian media do not seem more trustworthy, better informed, or more professionally run than in most countries; quite to the contrary, they are owned by a few oligarchs, and their bias and manipulation are both transparent and crude.
The answer lies in the most insidious Soviet heritage.
More than 62 million Russians who are over 40 today were formed by the Soviet system.
Although many do not have much sympathy for the old regime, most have been conditioned to view any published word, or anything they see on TV, as a type of gospel truth not subject critical assessment.
Such atrophy of critical thinking and unprecedented information naivete make it possible for a politically and financially motivated press to manipulate a good half of the voters.
The abnormal power of the media also means that they are not run as normal businesses.
Since owning the media allows powerful interests to achieve their coveted political or economic objectives, political influence, not profit, drives media behavior.
Just look at who stands behind the most important newspapers and TV stations in Russia.
The largest players are the state and business empires for which the media is not a significant profit center.
The list of major owners, in addition to the federal government and the usually mentioned moguls, such as Berezovsky and Gusinsky, includes the oil giant Lukoil, the gas empire Gazprom, the financial group Oneksimbank, the Moscow government, and others.
Of these, only the Gusinsky group derives its profits primarily from the media.
Another peculiarity of Russia's media market, stemming from the absence of the profit motive, is a chronic overproduction of titles.
New players are forever trying to gain a foothold of political influence. 17 daily newspapers are published in Moscow, 10 of which call themselves "national."
Some 5,000 newspapers appear in Russia.
Their total combined circulation is of similar size to total newspaper circulation in Germany, but there fewer than 500 titles do the job.
All the while, the total volume of advertisements during the best of times (before the 1998 crisis) did not exceed $2.5billion, as compared with more than $20 billion in Germany and more than $117 billion in America.
The power to think critically develops only slowly.
So Russia must wait before Russian politics asserts its independence and the media learns to report, rather than create.
The hope that this may one day happen lies in the fact that, despite its corruption, the media is free -- one of the great legacies of Yeltsin's presidency.
High Tensions In the Low Countries
Europe cannot afford a dogfight between these two founding member states, so it's high time to put emotions aside and review their differences on the future course of European integration.
As a former Dutch State Secretary for European Affairs and Benelux Coordinator, I believe that the Netherlands and Belgium can once again play complementary roles.
From the very beginning, these countries have represented the different aspects of Europe's identity: Belgium, as an industrial country, continentally oriented, bilingual, and an intermediary with southern Europe, and the Netherlands with its strong agricultural and trading tradition and its Anglo-Saxon and Atlantic orientation.
Of the two, Belgium tends to be more uncritically supportive of the EU.
Polls show that more than 80% of Belgians want yet more integration, whereas roughly 50% of the Dutch describing themselves as Euroskeptics.
They value the Union for its economic benefits, but are wary of its politics.
Belgian-Dutch cooperation has in years past been essential in helping Europe to move forward.
The Benelux Economic Union treaty of 1944 was an early testing ground for the Europe of the Six, and it was the joint Benelux Memorandum, fathered by the far-sighted J. W. Beyen and presented in Messina in 1955, that gave the impetus to the creation of the common market.
Indeed, it was the basis on which Belgian Foreign Minister Paul-Henri Spaak and his colleagues worked when setting the scene for the Treaty of Rome and the European Economic Community.
The Spaak committee devised a system that balanced the voting power of states of varying size.
Clearly, a system of one vote per member state would have meant domination by Europe's smaller states.
Conversely, a system based on population would have gone too far in favoring the big ones.
Balance was achieved partly by a system of weighting of votes in the Council of Ministers, where most decisions are taken.
With each enlargement of the Union, this system of decision-making has been largely maintained.
The equilibrium in voting rights between small and large member states was also secured by vesting exclusive authority to propose regulation in the Commission, which expresses the common interests of the Community.
This authority was reinforced by requiring unanimity among member states to overrule the Commission -- a provision that has strengthened the smaller states against the larger ones.
As open economies, Belgium and the Netherlands have both been interested in developing the internal market, while differing in their methods.
Belgium followed the mainly French monetarist school, while the Netherlands shared Germany's preference for economic convergence before committing to exchange-rate parity.
Once President Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Federal Chancellor Helmut Schmidt made the joint Franco German proposal for the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), both Belgium and the Netherlands worked together to achieve that common goal.
