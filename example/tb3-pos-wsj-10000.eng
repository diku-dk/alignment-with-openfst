The current account deficit on France 's balance of payments narrowed to 1.48 billion French francs ( $ 236.8 million ) in August from a revised 2.1 billion francs in July , the Finance Ministry said .
Previously , the July figure was estimated at a deficit of 613 million francs .
Seasonally adjusted figures for August were n't available because of a recent strike
that has disrupted the ministry 's data collection .
Every workday at 11 a.m. , 40-year-old Mike Sinyard dons cycling clothes , hops on a bike
he keeps at his Morgan Hill , Calif. , office and sets out to cover a distance most people would travel only by car .
As many as 50 of his employees at Specialized Bicycle Components Inc. ride with him .
When they return to their desks at 1 p.m. , they have pedaled 20 miles .
Such fervor for cycling helped Mr. Sinyard build a creative company at the forefront of its industry .
Founded by bike enthusiasts rather than businessmen , Specialized spotted the appeal of fat-tired bikes
that go almost anywhere and began mass-producing them in 1981 .
In the past five years , the company 's sales have grown to $ 80 million from $ 26 million .
Today , so-called mountain bikes account for two-thirds of the $ 2 billion spent annually on all bicycles in the U.S .
With 65 % of its sales coming from mountain bikes , Specialized is widely considered to be a market leader .
( Accessories , largely for mountain-bike users , account for much of the rest of sales .
)
But today , the company needs its entrepreneurial spirit more than ever .
One large competitor after another is leaping into the booming market Specialized helped create , turning out mountain bikes with such well-known names as Schwinn , Peugeot , Raleigh and Nishiki .
Thus , Mr. Sinyard 's company must innovate more than ever to stay ahead of them , by developing new products specifically for mountain biking .
At the same time , though , it must become more structured to better manage its growth .
Accomplishing both will be a balancing act as challenging as riding a unicycle .
It is a problem common to small companies
that have grown fast -- especially when their success attracts big-time competitors .
`` The big word around Specialized is passion , '' says Erik Eidsmo , a former ski-industry executive
whom Mr. Sinyard recruited from Citicorp to run marketing and sales .
`` What
I hope to bring to this is another word : process .
That 's my challenge .
It 's Mike 's challenge as well .
''
Mr. Eidsmo is one of several key people from outside the cycling industry
who were hired to bring the free-wheeling , fast-growing company under tighter control .
`` We had a lot of problems , '' Mr. Sinyard says .
While the company 's sales were soaring , `` We still had a system
that was probably appropriate for $ 10 million to $ 20 million in sales .
'' Adds Mr. Eidsmo , `` What felt good that day was done that day .
Since his arrival in May , Mr. Eidsmo has put in place techniques learned while working for Citicorp , such as management-by-objective , detailed project plans and forecasts of company sales and product trends .
`` We 're finally getting -- and it 's been very painful -- some understanding of what
the company 's long-term horizon should begin to look like , '' Mr. Eidsmo says .
`` But it 's risky , '' he says of Specialized
's attempt to adopt a corporate structure .
`` You do n't want to lose the magic '' of the company 's creative drive .
Hoping to stay ahead of the pack , the company is emphasizing innovation .
At a recent trade show , convention-goers lined up to view a new Specialized bike frame
that weighs just 2.7 pounds -- a pound less than the lightest mountain-bike frame on the market .
By replacing the frame 's steel lugs with titanium ones , Mr. Sinyard 's company plans to make its next generation of frames even lighter .
At the trade show , Specialized also unveiled a revolutionary three-spoked bike wheel developed jointly by Specialized and Du Pont Co .
Made of space-age materials , the wheel spokes are designed like airplane wings to shave 10 minutes off the time of a rider in a 100-mile race , the company claims .
It currently costs $ 750 , though Mr. Sinyard thinks the price can be reduced within three years to between $ 200 and $ 250 .
He was able to slash the price of the company 's least expensive mountain bike to $ 279 from $ 750 in
But demands on the company 's creativity are certain to grow .
Competition is intensifying as larger companies invade a mountain-bike market Mr. Sinyard 's company once had virtually all to itself .
U.S. Cycling Federation official Philip Milburn says mountain biking is `` growing at such a monstrous rate that a lot of companies are getting into this .
One especially coveted Specialized market
the new players are targeting is mountain-bike accessories , which
Mr. Eidsmo calls `` the future of our business .
'' Accessories not only sell faster than whole bikes , they also offer profit margins nearly double the 25 % to 30 % or so on sales of complete cycles .
To get a piece of the business , Nike Inc. , Beaverton , Ore. , introduced a line of mountain-bike shoes .
About a month ago , Michelin Tire Corp. , Greenville , S.C. , began selling mountain-bike tires , for years
a Specialized stronghold .
Competition in the sale of complete bikes is heating up too .
Trek Bicycle Corp. , which accounts for one-quarter of the $ 400 million in annual sales at its Milwaukee-based parent , Intrepid Corp. , entered the mountain-bike business in 1983 .
Trek previously made only traditional road bikes , but `` it did n't take a rocket scientist to change a road bike into a mountain bike , '' says Trek 's president , Dick Burke .
The segment now makes up roughly two-thirds of his company 's total sales .
At Giant Bicycle Inc. , Rancho Dominguez , Calif. , sales have tripled since the company entered the U.S. mountain-bike business in 1987 .
A subsidiary of a Taiwanese holding company with world-wide sales of $ 150 million , Giant is one example of the sudden globalization of Mr. Sinyard 's once-cozy market niche .
Schwinn Bicycle Co. , Chicago , established joint ventures with bike companies in mainland China and Hungary to sell bikes .
In the past year , Derby International Corp. , Luxembourg , has acquired such major brands as Peugeot , Raleigh and Nishiki .
In response to the internationalization of the business , Mr. Sinyard 's company is replacing independent distributors overseas with wholly owned subsidiaries .
The move will cut out the cost of a middleman and give Specialized more control over marketing and sales .
But as Bill Austin , Giant 's president , puts it , `` With some of the bigger players consolidating their strength , the game has changed .
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell to a seasonally adjusted 332,000 for the week ended Oct. 14 from 396,000
the previous week , the Labor Department said .
The number of people receiving state benefits in the week ended Oct. 7 fell to a seasonally adjusted 2,202,000 , or 2.1 % of those covered by unemployment insurance , from 2,205,000
the previous week , when the insured unemployment rate was 2.2 % .
Counting all state and federal benefit programs , the number of people receiving unemployment benefits in the week ended Oct. 7 fell to 1,784,400 from 1,810,700
a week earlier .
These figures are n't seasonally adjusted .
Revco D.S. Inc. , the drugstore chain
that filed for bankruptcy-court protection last year , received a $ 925 million offer from a group led by Texas billionaire Robert Bass .
Revco reacted cautiously , saying the plan would add $ 260 million of new debt to the highly leveraged company .
It was Revco 's huge debt from its $ 1.3 billion leveraged buy-out in 1986 that forced it to seek protection under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code .
Revco insists that the proposal is simply an `` expression of interest , '' because under Chapter 11 Revco has `` exclusivity rights '' until Feb. 28 .
Those rights prevent anyone other than Revco from proposing a reorganization plan .
Also under Chapter 11 , a reorganization plan is subject to approval by bondholders , banks and other creditors .
A financial adviser for Revco bondholders , David Schulte , of Chilmark Partners , had mixed reactions to the offer .
He said he feared a Revco reorganization might force bondholders to accept a `` cheap deal , '' and that the Bass group 's offer would give them more money .
However , the group is offering to pay off bondholders in cash only -- $ 260.5 million -- and no equity .
The Revco bonds are high-yield , high-risk `` junk '' bonds ; holders have $ 750 million in claims against Revco , Mr. Schulte said .
Revco received the offer Oct. 20 , but issued a response yesterday only after a copy of the proposal was made public by bondholders .
Acadia Partners Limited Partnership , a Fort Worth , Texas , partnership
that includes the Robert M. Bass Group , made the proposal .
Mr. Bass is based in Fort Worth .
Analysts said the nation 's second-largest drugstore chain was a valuable company , despite its financial woes .
Its problem , they say , is that management paid too much in the leveraged buy-out and the current $ 515 million debt load is keeping Revco in the red .
`` If bought at the right price , it could still be profitable , '' said Jeffrey Stein , an analyst at McDonald & Co. , Cleveland .
In addition , Revco 's 1,900 stores in 27 states represent a lot of real estate , he said , and demographics are helping pharmacies : The nation 's aging population will boost demand for prescription drugs .
Last week , Revco 's parent company , Anac Holding Corp. , said the company reported a loss of $ 16.2 million for the fiscal first quarter , compared with a loss of $ 27.9 million in the year-earlier quarter .
Sales were $ 597.8 million , up 2.4 % from the previous year .
The company , based in Twinsburg , Ohio , said its operating profit before depreciation and amortization increased 51 % , to $ 9.2 million from $ 6.1 million .
Acadia Partners and the Bass Group declined to comment .
The partnership also includes American Express Co. , Equitable Life Assurance Society of the U.S. and Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc .
The offer consists of $ 410.5 million in cash and the rest in notes .
Acadia would sell up to 10 % of the equity in the reorganized company to creditors and bondholders in exchange for the cash distribution , but creditors and bondholders would receive no discount for their shares .
Revco 's chairman and chief executive officer , Boake A. Sells , said both
the company and the bondholders have put forth reorganization plans , but little progress has been made since negotiations began this summer .
He said he has not met with representatives from Acadia .
Any reorganization proposal , Mr. Sells said , is difficult to assess because it must be agreed upon by the company , bondholders , banks and other creditors .
Revco has $ 1.5 billion in claims outstanding .
`` It 's not like the board can decide '' by itself , Mr. Sells said , adding , `` we 're indifferent to ( the Bass ) plan .
We just want a plan that satisfies creditors and at the end leaves a healthy Revco .
But Mr. Schulte , the bondholders ' adviser , said Revco was dragging its feet in responding to the proposal .
`` They want to pretend it does n't exist , '' he said .
Mr. Schulte , who met with Acadia representatives on Oct. 10 , said , `` It 's certainly a responsible offer .
It 's not an effort to steal the company '' in the middle of the night .
American Telephone & Telegraph Co. unveiled a sweetened pension and early-retirement program for management that it hopes will enable it to save $ 450 million in the next year .
AT&T also said net income rose 19 % in the third quarter .
AT&T said its amended pension program will nearly double to 34,000
the number of managers eligible to retire with immediate pension payments .
AT&T said that based on studies of other companies
that have offered retirement plans , it expects about one-third of its eligible managers to retire under the new program .
AT&T said third-quarter net income grew , despite stiff competition in all of the company 's markets .
Net income rose to $ 699 million , or 65 cents
a share , from the year-earlier $ 587 million , or 55 cents
a share .
Revenue edged up to $ 8.9 billion from $ 8.81 billion .
The latest period 's net was reduced $ 102 million , or nine cents
a share , for a change in depreciation method and concurrent changes in estimates of depreciable lives and net salvage for certain telecommunications equipment .
The results roughly matched estimates of securities analysts , who were encouraged by AT&T increasing its operating margin to 13 % from 11 %
a year ago , because of continued cost-cutting efforts .
Sales of long-distance services , an extremely competitive market , rose 6.4 % .
But the growth was partly offset by lower equipment sales and rentals and price cuts on some products .
Under the amended pension program , AT&T managers
who have at least five years of service will have five years added to their age and length of service for pension purposes .
Managers
who retire Dec. 30 will have an additional 15 % added to their monthly pension for as long as five years or age 65 , whichever comes earlier .
An AT&T spokeswoman said the company would likely replace about one-third of its managers
who choose to retire with new employees .
Analysts hailed the sweetened pension package , which
they said had been the subject of rumors for several months .
`` This tells you
AT&T is serious about continuing to manage their cost structure and is committed to 20%-a-year earnings growth , '' said Jack Grubman , an analyst with PaineWebber Inc .
But other analysts expressed disappointment that the cost-cutting move wo n't result in even greater earnings growth .
`` This is a good move , but it only gets you to where people 's expectations already are , '' in terms of earnings growth , said Joel D. Gross , an analyst with Donaldson , Lufkin & Jenrette .
Mr. Gross said he had hoped that a cost savings of $ 450 million would result in even greater growth than the 20 % annual earnings increase AT&T has told analysts
it expects in the future .
AT&T said the special retirement option will increase fourth-quarter expenses .
But the company said the amount ca n't be determined until it knows how many managers opt to retire .
AT&T said the expense increase will be largely offset by a gain from its previously announced plan to swap its holdings in Ing .
C. Olivetti & Co. for shares in Cie .
Industriali Riunite , an Italian holding company .
For the nine months , AT&T said net income was $ 1.99 billion , or $ 1.85
a share , up 19 % from $ 1.67 billion , or $ 1.56
Revenue gained 3.1 % to $ 26.81 billion from $ 26 billion .
In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange , AT&T shares closed at $ 43.375 , up 87.5 cents .
Bankers Trust New York Corp. won permission from the Federal Reserve Board to move the company 's private placement department to its fledgling securities subsidiary .
The seemingly mundane action , which was opposed by the Securities Industry Association , a trade group , has important implications for banks ' recent entry into the underwriting of corporate securities .
The Fed 's action increases the volume of publicly registered securities that banks ' securities affiliates will be able to underwrite .
Several other banks have similar applications pending .
Over the past two years , the Fed has given a handful of banks ' securities affiliates permission to underwrite and deal in a variety of corporate , asset-backed and municipal securities
that had previously been the sole domain of securities firms .
Securities firms have challenged those Fed approvals , saying they violate federal laws separating the banking and securities businesses .
However , the Fed limited the revenue that banks could earn from these new underwriting activities to no more than 10 % of the revenue earned from other securities activities long open to banks , such as dealing in U.S. Treasurys .
For some banks that 10 % ceiling created problems .
But , by allowing BT Securities Inc. to handle private placements , the Fed boosted the volume of new types of underwriting that the unit can do .
Private placements involve debt and equity securities , typically in denominations of $ 1 million , that are sold to institutional investors and are n't registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission .
Last year , Bankers Trust said it placed $ 10 billion of corporate debt and equities privately .
Boston Edison Co. said it will take a previously reported $ 60 million charge against earnings in the fourth quarter .
The charge resulted from a settlement approved yesterday by the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities .
As expected , the settlement limits rate increases for three years and ties future charges to customers for operation of the troubled Pilgrim Nuclear Power Station to that plant 's performance .
In its order , the state regulatory agency said the company `` must be held accountable for the mistakes made in the management of the plant 's operation .
'' Pilgrim had been closed for 32 months .
Furukawa Electric Co. said it plans to increase production of computer memory devices on a large scale in the U.S. and Japan .
As part of the move , its affiliated U.S. company , International Components Technology Corp. , purchased a Mexican plant formerly belonging to KSI Disc Products Inc .
The price was n't disclosed .
Together with two existing plants in the U.S. , Furukawa said it will expand its current local monthly production of memory disks to 1.4 million sheets from 800,000 .
In Japan , Furukawa said it will raise production at a plant outside Tokyo to 300,000 sheets monthly from 100,000 .
Furukawa said the U.S. market is strengthening as related computer technology gains in sophistication and quality .
Singer Bette Midler won a $ 400,000 federal court jury verdict against Young & Rubicam in a case
that threatens a popular advertising industry practice of using `` sound-alike '' performers to tout products .
The decision in Los Angeles federal court stems from a 1985 Mercury Sable TV ad that Young & Rubicam worked up for Ford Motor Co .
The ad agency had approached Ms. Midler about appearing , but she declined , citing a longstanding policy of refusing advertising work .
The agency then turned to a former backup singer for Ms. Midler
who appeared in the ad and crooned what was generally considered a more than credible imitation of Ms. Midler 's 1973 hit song `` Do You Wanna Dance .
The appeals court held : `` When a distinctive voice of a professional singer is widely known and is deliberately imitated in order to sell a product , the sellers have appropriated what is not theirs .
The judge in the jury trial said there was insufficient evidence to hold Ford liable in the case .
In a statement , Young & Rubicam called the award `` unfortunate but bearable .
Peter Laird , a Los Angeles lawyer for Ms. Midler , said , `` We believe that the verdict reaffirms her position and our position that advertisers and advertising agencies can not with impunity imitate the voices of well-known performers .
That is a property right
that belongs to the performer .
The award , although far less than the $ 10 million , including punitive damages , that Ms. Midler sought , is likely to force Madison Avenue to further rethink how they use famous songs in ads .
Last year 's appeals court decision , for instance , spawned several suits , reportedly including a recent action by the heirs of singer Bobby Darin against McDonald 's Corp. over its `` Mac Tonight '' TV commercials , a rough parody of Mr. Darin 's `` Mack
the Knife '' trademark .
The appeals-court decision last year was particularly surprising because the same court had dismissed a similar case in 1970 involving singer Nancy Sinatra and a tire ad -- also a Young & Rubicam product .
Ms. Sinatra sued over the use of her `` These Boots are Made for Walkin ' '' song in the ad .
At that time , the court held that such a claim would interfere with federal copyright law , which has always cracked down on the unauthorized copying of songs and musical compositions but never actual performances .
`` One thing
that is a little unnerving is that you had three old men on the court of appeals in California coming up with a statement that Nancy Sinatra is not distinctive but that Bette Midler is .
I am not sure that judges , many of whom
I like very much , are proper repositories for making distinctions about pop singers , '' said Richard Kurnit , a New York advertising lawyer .
Nonetheless , Mr. Kurnit said that the latest decisions are having a chilling effect .
`` It has made people think twice about how they use music and is forcing them to be more circumspect about doing a particular rendition of a song in its most famous form , '' he said .

Just five months after Ogilvy Group was swallowed up in an unsolicited takeover , Kenneth Roman , Ogilvy 's chairman and chief executive officer , said he is leaving to take a top post at American Express Co .
Mr. Roman , 59 years old , abruptly announced he will leave the venerable ad agency , whose largest client is American Express , to become American Express 's executive vice president for corporate affairs and communications .
He will succeed Harry L. Freeman , 57 , who has said he will retire in December .
Mr. Freeman said in August that he would retire by the end of this year to take `` executive responsibility '' for an embarrassing effort to discredit banker Edmond Safra .
American Express representatives apparently influenced the publication of unfavorable articles about Mr. Safra .
The company later apologized and agreed to make $ 8 million in contributions to charities chosen by him .
Although Mr. Freeman is retiring , he will continue to work as a consultant for American Express on a project basis .
Ad industry executives were n't surprised by Mr. Roman 's decision to leave Ogilvy .
The agency , under his direction , bitterly fought a takeover attempt by WPP Group PLC of London before succumbing in May .
And although Mr. Roman and WPP 's chief executive , Martin Sorrell , have gone out of their way to be publicly supportive of each other , people close to Mr. Roman say he was unhappy giving up control of the company .
Some executives also cite tension because of efforts by Mr. Sorrell , a financial man , to cut costs at the agency .
Mr. Roman will be succeeded as the head of Ogilvy 's flagship ad agency , Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide , by Graham Phillips , 50 , who had been president of North American operations and who , like Mr. Sorrell , is British .
Alexander Brody , 56 , will take on the newly created position of president of the world-wide agency and chief executive of its international operations .
He had been president of the international operations .
Mr. Roman also had overseen Ogilvy Group 's two other units , the Scali McCabe Sloves advertising agency and its research division , but those units will now report directly to WPP .
Mr. Roman appears custom-made for the American Express job .
Known as a traditional executive , he is very much in the conservative American Express mold .
Moreover , after 26 years at Ogilvy
he had honed a reputation for being squeaky-clean and a straight arrow -- which can only help American Express in the wake of the Safra incident .
He also is close to American Express 's chairman and chief executive officer , James D. Robinson III .
Aside from working with Mr. Robinson on the American Express advertising account for about 11 years , Mr. Roman serves on several of the same charities and boards as Mr. Robinson .
The abrupt management change sparked widespread speculation that Mr. Roman had been pushed out of Ogilvy 's top spot by Mr. Sorrell .
But Mr. Roman flatly denied the speculation , saying Mr. Sorrell had tried several times to persuade him to stay , offering various incentives and in one instance sending a note with a case of wine ( The wine , naturally , was Seagram 's brand , an Ogilvy client ) .
`` He asked me not to resign .
The implication that I was pushed aside would n't be accurate , '' Mr. Roman said .
Mr. Sorrell , traveling in the Far East , could n't be reached .
Mr. Roman said American Express 's Mr. Robinson first approached him about the job in late September .
According to industry executives , Peter Sutherland , a former European Community commissioner from Ireland , was also a serious contender for the American Express job .
Although it ultimately was n't offered to him , he will be on retainer to American Express as an adviser on international matters .
After talking on and off for the past four weeks , Mr. Roman said , he agreed to take the job because `` it 's the right time , it 's a terrific opportunity , and I think I leave the company in very strong hands .
It was my decision , not anyone else 's .
Mr. Roman also brushed aside reports about infighting between him and Mr. Phillips , his successor at Ogilvy .
The two executives could hardly be more different .
Mr. Roman comes across as a low-key executive ; Mr. Phillips has a flashier personality .
During time off , Mr. Roman tends to his garden ; Mr. Phillips confesses to a fondness for , among other things , fast cars and planes .
Industry executives say that although the two executives used to clash more frequently , the WPP takeover brought them closer together .
`` I 'm the guy
who made him
head of New York , head of the U.S. , president of North America , and recommended him { to Mr. Sorrell } as my successor .
Would I have done all those things successively if I did n't think he was the right guy ?
'' Mr. Roman asked .
He labeled reports of friction `` ridiculous , '' and said that he spent part of the weekend on Mr. Phillips 's boat in Connecticut .
Mr. Roman will oversee American Express 's public relations and government affairs , among other things , but he wo n't be involved in its advertising , which is handled by the operating units .
`` I consider this a second career , '' he said .
He also will sit on the company 's corporate planning and policy committee , made up of the top corporate and operating executives .
Mr. Roman 's departure is n't expected to have any enormous repercussions at Ogilvy .
American Express , Kraft General Foods , and Mattel executives said the move wo n't affect their relationships with the ad agency .
`` General Foods 's relationships with its agencies are based on the agencies ' work , and will continue to be , '' said David Hurwitt , a vice president of Kraft General Foods .
But some clients and analysts expressed concern that Mr. Phillips is n't as well-known to many clients .
`` Ken was my key contact , '' said J. Nicholas Hahn , president and chief executive officer of Cotton Inc. , which represents cotton producers .
`` I do n't know { Mr. Phillips } all that well .
I have n't seen or talked to him in several years .
And some analysts questioned whether Mr. Phillips would have the skills Ogilvy needs to turn the agency around .
While the agency has done well in many parts of the world , its flagship New York office has had a dismal track record recently ; it has won few new accounts while losing big ones , including Maxwell House .
`` I think { Mr. Phillips } is going to need some help .
I think they need creative leadership , and I do n't think they have it , '' said Emma Hill , an analyst with Wertheim & Co .
Ogilvy & Mather 's top creative executive , Norman Berry , left the agency earlier this year .
`` Norm Berry was a creative inspiration at the company , and nobody has filled that void , '' said Ms. Hill .
But other analysts said that having Mr. Phillips succeed Mr. Roman would make for a smooth transition .
`` Graham Phillips has been there a long time , knows the culture well , is aggressive , and apparently gets along well with '' Mr. Sorrell , said Andrew Wallach , an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert .
`` It 's probably a reasonable transition .
Hopefully , he 'll be the answer to the problems they 've had in New York .
Sale of Saatchi Unit Close
Computer Sciences Corp. , El Segundo , Calif. , said it is close to making final an agreement to buy Cleveland Consulting Associates from Saatchi & Saatchi
Computer Sciences would n't disclose the proposed purchase price for Cleveland Consulting , which counsels companies on logistics and supply .
But David Lord , managing editor of Consultants News , an industry publication based in Fitzwilliam , N.H. , said an industry standard would suggest a purchase price of between one and two times Cleveland Consulting 's approximately $ 15 million annual revenue .
Both Saatchi & Saatchi , which announced its intention to sell off most of its consulting business in June , and Cleveland Consulting declined to comment on the proposed sale .

Japan 's Daiwa Securities Co. named Masahiro Dozen president .
Mr. Dozen succeeds Sadakane Doi , who will become vice chairman .
Yoshitoki Chino retains his title of chairman of Daiwa , Japan 's second-largest securities firm .
In Japanese firms , the president usually is in charge of day-to-day operations , while the chairman 's role is more a ceremonial one .
The title of chief executive officer is n't used .
While people within Daiwa , particularly internationalists , expected that Mr. Dozen , 52 , would eventually become Daiwa 's president , the speed of his promotion surprised many .
It was only earlier this year that the jovial , easygoing executive -- he likes to joke with Americans about how his name is synonymous with twelve -- was appointed deputy president .
Mr. Dozen is taking over the reins of a securities company
that does very well in its domestic market but that is still seeking to realize its potential in global investment banking and securities dealing .
Daiwa is one of the world 's largest securities firms .
As of March 31 , the Daiwa group had shareholder equity of 801.21 billion yen ( $ 5.64 billion ) .
For the six months ended Sept. 30 , Daiwa reported unconsolidated ( parent company ) net income of 79.03 billion yen ( $ 556.5 million ) on revenue of 332.38 billion yen ( $ 2.34 billion ) .
Both
figures were record highs .
Several observers interpreted Mr. Dozen 's appointment as an attempt by Daiwa to make its international operations more profitable while preparing the firm for the effects of the continuing deregulation of Japan 's domestic markets , which should mean increased competition .
All of Japan 's so-called Big Four securities firms -- Nomura Securities Co. Ltd. , the world 's largest , Nikko Securities Co. Ltd. , Yamaichi Securities Co. Ltd. and Daiwa -- have suffered setbacks in their attempts to break into foreign markets .
While they have moved to the fore in underwriting fixed-income securities in the Eurobond market -- mostly for Japanese firms -- they have been only marginally profitable , if at all , in the U.S .
American institutional investors have never had a large appetite for Japanese equities .
And while the Japanese have stepped up their purchases of U.S. shares in the past several months , they have shown themselves in the past to be fickle investors .
At the same time , Daiwa and its brethren have faced stiff competition from well-entrenched American competitors
that have prevented them from building strong links to U.S. corporations and institutional investors .
Mr. Dozen knows these problems firsthand .
When he arrived in the U.S. in 1969 -- the start of an eight-year tour -- he tried selling Japanese yen-denominated bonds to U.S. investors .
`` He made desperate efforts , using the yellow pages from beginning to end , '' said Koji Yoneyama , president of Daiwa 's U.S. unit .
`` But not a single piece of paper was sold .
By his own account , Mr. Dozen did n't do much better with U.S. bonds .
In an interview
a few months ago , he recalled how after some training at Salomon Brothers Inc. , he successfully bid for the opportunity to sell portions of 20 U.S. corporate bond issues .
But he could n't sell any .
`` Japanese stock salesmen selling American bonds ?
Maybe it 's crazy , '' he said .
Mr. Dozen even related the indignity suffered when he and two colleagues went on an overnight fishing expedition off the New Jersey shore and caught nothing .
Upon returning to New York , `` Exhausted , I got into a taxicab , and the woman driver said : ` Americans make better fishermen , ' '' he recalled .
Undaunted , Mr. Dozen said that Daiwa 's goal is to build `` a high-technology oriented international organization with maybe some Japanese flavor to it .
He said that he was particularly interested in his firm gaining expertise in futures , options , mortgaged-backed securities , computerized trading and investment systems as well as mergers and acquisitions .
Mr. Dozen said Daiwa 's strengths were its large capital base , its influential position in the Tokyo market and its links to Japanese corporations and institutional investors .
Mr. Dozen joined Daiwa upon his graduation from Kyoto University in 1959 .
Like many young recruits in Japanese securities firms , he began his career peddling stock to individual investors .
In his climb to the top , Mr. Dozen also headed the company 's stock-exchange division , its fixed-income units and its international operations .
`` He was constantly picking up new things to fill out his experience ; he is very well-balanced , '' said Takuro Isoda , chairman of Daiwa 's U.S. unit in New York .
But it

I suggest that The Wall Street Journal ( as well as other U.S. news publications of like mind ) should put its money where its mouth is : Lend computer equipment to replace that damaged at El Espectador , buy ad space , publish stories under the bylines of El Espectador journalists .
Perhaps an arrangement could be worked out to `` sponsor '' El Espectador journalists and staff by paying for added security in exchange for exclusive stories .
Reward El Espectador 's courage with real support .

This is the year
the negative ad , for years
a secondary presence in most political campaigns , became the main event .
The irony is that the attack commercial , after getting a boost in last year 's presidential campaign , has come of age in an off-off election year with only a few contests scattered across the country .
But in the three leading political contests of 1989 , the negative ads have reached new levels of hostility , raising fears that this kind of mudslinging , empty of significant issues , is ushering in a new era of campaigns without content .
`` Now , '' says Joseph Napolitan , a pioneer in political television , `` the idea is to attack first , last and always .
A trend
that started with the first stirrings of politics , accelerated with the dawn of the television age and became a sometimes-tawdry art form in 1988 , has reached an entirely new stage .
`` To get people 's attention these days , '' says Douglas Bailey , a political consultant , `` your TV ad needs to be bold and entertaining , and , more often than not , that means confrontational .
And , unlike a few years ago , you do n't even have to worry whether the ad is truthful .
In 1989 , as often as not , the principal fights in the major campaigns are prompted by the ads themselves .
Take a look , then , at the main attack commercials
that set the tone for Tuesday 's elections in New York City , New Jersey and Virginia :
New York City : The screen fills with a small , tight facial shot of David Dinkins , Democratic candidate for mayor of New York City .
`` David Dinkins failed to file his income taxes for four straight years , '' says a disembodied male voice .
And then this television commercial , paid for by Republican Rudolph Giuliani 's campaign and produced by Roger Ailes , the master of negative TV ads , really gets down to business .
Mr. Dinkins , the ad charges , also failed to report his campaign contributions accurately , hid his links to a failing insurance company and paid a convicted kidnapper `` through a phony organization with no members , no receipts and no office .
`` David Dinkins , '' says the kicker , `` Why does he always wait until he 's caught ?
`` Nasty innuendoes , '' says John Siegal , Mr. Dinkins 's issues director , `` designed to prosecute a case of political corruption
that simply does n't exist .
Stung by the Giuliani ads , Mr. Dinkins 's TV consultants , Robert Shrum and David Doak , finally unleashed a negative ad of their own .
The screen shows two distorted , unrecognizable photos , presumably of two politicians .
`` Compare two candidates for mayor , '' says the announcer .
`` One says he 's for banning cop-killer bullets .
The other has opposed a ban on cop-killer bullets .
One claims he 's pro-choice .
The other has opposed a woman 's right to choose .
`` Funny thing , '' says the kicker , `` both
these candidates are named Rudolph Giuliani .
Who 's telling the truth ?
Everybody -- and nobody .
It 's a classic situation of ads
that are true but not always fully accurate .
Mr. Dinkins did fail to file his income taxes for four years , but he insists he voluntarily admitted the `` oversight '' when he was being considered for a city job .
He was on the board of an insurance company with financial problems , but he insists he made no secret of it .
The city 's Campaign Finance Board has refused to pay Mr. Dinkins $ 95,142 in matching funds because his campaign records are incomplete .
The campaign has blamed these reporting problems on computer errors .
And , says Mr. Dinkins , he did n't know the man his campaign paid for a get-out-the-vote effort had been convicted of kidnapping .
But , say Mr. Dinkins 's managers , he did have an office and his organization did have members .
Mr. Giuliani 's campaign chairman , Peter Powers , says the Dinkins ad is `` deceptive .
'' The other side , he argues , `` knows Giuliani has always been pro-choice , even though he has personal reservations .
They know he is generally opposed to cop-killer bullets , but that he had some reservations about the language in the legislation .
Virginia : Democratic Lt. Gov. Douglas Wilder opened his gubernatorial battle with Republican Marshall Coleman with an abortion commercial produced by Frank Greer that analysts of every political persuasion agree was a tour de force .
Against a shot of Monticello superimposed on an American flag , an announcer talks about the `` strong tradition of freedom and individual liberty '' that Virginians have nurtured for generations .
Then , just as an image of the statue of Thomas Jefferson dissolves from the screen , the announcer continues : `` On the issue of abortion , Marshall Coleman wants to take away your right to choose and give it to the politicians .
That commercial -- which said Mr. Coleman wanted to take away the right of abortion `` even in cases of rape and incest , '' a charge Mr. Coleman denies -- changed the dynamics of the campaign , transforming it , at least in part , into a referendum on abortion .
The ad prompted Mr. Coleman , the former Virginia attorney general , to launch a series of advertisements created by Bob Goodman and designed to shake Mr. Wilder 's support among the very women
who were attracted by the abortion ad .
The Coleman counterattack featured a close-up of a young woman in shadows and the ad suggested that she was recalling an unpleasant courtroom ordeal .
A voice says , `` C'mon , now , do n't you have boyfriends ?
'' Then an announcer interjects : `` It was Douglas Wilder
who introduced a bill to force rape victims age 13 and younger to be interrogated about their private lives by lawyers for accused rapists .
So the next time Mr. Wilder talks about the rights of women , ask him about this law
he tried to pass .
Mr. Wilder did introduce such legislation 17 years ago , but he did so at the request of a constituent , a common legislative technique used by lawmakers .
The legislation
itself noted that it was introduced `` by request , '' and in 1983 Mr. Wilder introduced a bill to protect rape victims from unfounded interrogation .
`` People have grown tired of these ads and Coleman has gotten the stigma of being a negative campaigner , '' says Mark Rozell , a political scientist at Mary Washington College .
`` Wilder has managed to get across the idea that Coleman will say anything to get elected governor and -- more important -- has been able to put the onus for all the negative campaigning on Coleman .
Mr. Coleman said this week that he would devote the remainder of the political season to positive campaigning , but the truce lasted only hours .
By Tuesday night , television stations were carrying new ads featuring Mr. Coleman himself raising questions about Mr. Wilder 's sensitivity to rape victims .
New Jersey : The attacks began when Democratic Rep. James Florio aired an ad featuring a drawing of Pinocchio and a photograph of Mr. Florio 's rival , Republican Rep. Jim Courter .
`` Remember Pinocchio ?
'' says a female voice .
`` Consider Jim Courter .
And then this commercial , produced by Bob Squier , gets down to its own mean and dirty business .
Pictures of rusted oil drums swim into focus , and the female voice purrs , `` That hazardous waste on his { Mr. Courter 's } property -- the neighbors are suing for consumer fraud .
'' And the nose on Mr. Courter 's face grows .
The only fraud involved , cry Mr. Courter 's partisans , is the Florio commercial
itself , and so the Courter campaign has responded with its own Pinocchio commercial , produced by Mr. Ailes .
In this one , the screen fills with photographs of both
candidates .
`` Who 's really lying ?
'' asks a female voice .
`` Florio 's lying , '' the voice goes on , because `` the barrel on Courter 's land ... contained heating oil , was cleaned up and caused no pollution .
Mr. Courter 's long nose shrinks while Mr. Florio 's grows .
Stephen Salmore , a political scientist at New Jersey 's Eagleton Institute , says it 's another example of an ad
that 's true but not fully accurate .
Barrels were dumped on the Courter property , a complaint was made , but there is no evidence
the barrels were a serious threat to the environment .
Even so , according to Mr. Salmore , the ad was `` devastating '' because it raised questions about Mr. Courter 's credibility .
But it 's building on a long tradition .
In 1966 , on route to a re-election rout of Democrat Frank O'Connor , GOP Gov. Nelson Rockefeller of New York appeared in person saying , `` If you want to keep the crime rates high , O'Connor is your man .
Lep Group PLC of Britain , which holds a 62.42 % stake in Profit Systems Inc. , said it is considering courses of action
that could result in its having `` active control '' of the company .
In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission , Lep Group said a possible course of action may include acquiring some or all of the Profit Systems shares it does n't already own .
It noted , however , that it
has n't determined any specific terms of a possible transaction .
Lep Group and affiliates currently control 3,513,072 Profit Systems common shares , or 62.42 % , the filing said .
Profit Systems , Valley Stream , N.Y. , is an air freight forwarding concern .
MCI Communications Corp. said it received a $ 12 million contract to provide virtual network services to Woolworth Corp. 's 5,600 corporate and retail sites in the
The contract also provides for advanced billing and network management services .
Woolworth said it expects to expand usage of the MCI services as it adds about 6,000 business locations over the next few years .
American Pioneer Inc. said it agreed in principle to sell its American Pioneer Life Insurance Co. subsidiary to Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc. 's HBJ Insurance Cos. for $ 27 million .
American Pioneer , parent of American Pioneer Savings Bank , said the sale will add capital and reduce the level of investments in subsidiaries for the thrift holding company .
Recently , the boards of both
the parent company and the thrift also voted to suspend dividends on preferred shares of both
companies and convert all preferred into common shares .
The company said the move was necessary to meet capital requirements .
The transaction is subject to execution of a definitive purchase agreement and approval by various regulatory agencies , including the insurance departments of the states of Florida and Indiana , the company said .
In the second quarter , American Pioneer reported a loss of $ 7.3 million , compared with net income of $ 1.1 million
a year earlier .
The banking operation had a loss of $ 8.7 million in the second quarter , largely because of problem real-estate loans , while the insurance operations earned $ 884,000 .
Sanwa Shutter Corp. said its affiliated company in Malaysia , established this April , will begin manufacturing steel doors Wednesday .
Its partner in the joint venture is Sin Kean Boon Metal Industries , Penang , Malaysia .
Company officials said the new company , Sin Kean Boon-Sanwa ( J.V .
) is capitalized at the equivalent of 54 million yen ( $ 381,000 ) .
The Japanese concern has a 40 % stake , while the local partner has a 60 % stake .
The new company was created to meet growing demand for steel doors , concurrent with increasing local concern about fire prevention , the company said .
The head of British Satellite Broadcasting Ltd. said he hopes to raise about # 450 million ( $ 711 million ) before the satellite-TV venture makes its delayed debut next spring -- with a major chunk coming from new investors .
`` We 'll raise it through bank loans .
We 'll raise it through { new } equity .
And we 'll raise it through existing shareholders '' as well as through junk bonds , said Anthony Simonds-Gooding , the private consortium 's chief executive .
He said he believes the bank loan , to be arranged by February , will supply about half of the financing .
British Satellite , which already has raised # 423.5 million from 10 backers , initially expected to seek an additional # 400 million .
Mr. Simonds-Gooding said the additional financing may leave British Satellite owned by about 20 investors , including Australian entrepreneur Alan Bond , whose nearly 36 % stake would be reduced to as little as 20 % .
Bond Corp. , British Satellite 's biggest investor , would like to withdraw from the satellite-TV consortium , and analysts have speculated Hollywood studios might buy the Bond stake .
But Mr. Simonds-Gooding said he is n't talking to any studios about investing .
Besides Bond Corp. , British Satellite 's other backers include Pearson PLC , Reed International PLC and Granada Group PLC .
The consortium faced a setback in May when technical problems forced it to postpone the September launch until next spring .
Continued uncertainty about the timing of the consortium 's debut could make it hard to find a # 450 million cash injection .
Mr. Simonds-Gooding conceded that British Satellite 's potential U.K. lenders `` are saying , ` When you 're on the air , you 'll
{ actually } get the money .
' '' The bankers also insist that the loans depend on the consortium raising more money from new and existing backers .
British Satellite today is unveiling
a # 30 million advertising and promotional drive for the consortium 's planned five channels of movies , sports , entertainment and news shows .
As part of the drive , the first 50,000 viewers
who put up # 10 each will get a package valued at # 170 -- including a satellite receiving dish , equipment installation and a three-month subscription to its pay-movie service .
British Satellite faces competition from Sky Television , a satellite-TV venture begun last February and owned by Rupert Murdoch 's News Corp .
The rivals currently are locked in a costly bidding contest for Hollywood film rights .
New England Electric System bowed out of the bidding for Public Service Co. of New Hampshire , saying that the risks were too high and the potential payoff too far in the future to justify a higher offer .
The move leaves United Illuminating Co. and Northeast Utilities as the remaining outside bidders for PS of New Hampshire , which also has proposed an internal reorganization plan in Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings under which
it would remain an independent company .
New England Electric , based in Westborough , Mass. , had offered $ 2 billion to acquire PS of New Hampshire , well below the $ 2.29 billion value United Illuminating places on its bid and the $ 2.25 billion Northeast says its bid is worth .
United Illuminating is based in New Haven , Conn. , and Northeast is based in Hartford , Conn .
PS of New Hampshire , Manchester , N.H. , values its internal reorganization plan at about $ 2.2 billion .
John Rowe , president and chief executive officer of New England Electric , said the company 's return on equity could suffer if it made a higher bid and its forecasts related to PS of New Hampshire -- such as growth in electricity demand and improved operating efficiencies -- did n't come true .
`` When we evaluated raising our bid , the risks seemed substantial and persistent over the next five years , and the rewards seemed a long way out .
That got hard to take , '' he added .
Mr. Rowe also noted that political concerns also worried New England Electric .
No matter
who owns PS of New Hampshire , after it emerges from bankruptcy proceedings its rates will be among the highest in the nation , he said .
`` That attracts attention ...
it was just another
one of the risk factors '' that led to the company 's decision to withdraw from the bidding , he added .
Wilbur Ross Jr. of Rothschild Inc. , the financial adviser to the troubled company 's equity holders , said the withdrawal of New England Electric might speed up the reorganization process .
The fact that New England proposed lower rate increases -- 4.8 % over seven years against around 5.5 % boosts proposed by the other two outside bidders -- complicated negotiations with state officials , Mr. Ross asserted .
`` Now the field is less cluttered , '' he added .
Separately , the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission turned down for now a request by Northeast seeking approval of its possible purchase of PS of New Hampshire .
Northeast said it would refile its request and still hopes for an expedited review by the FERC so that it could complete the purchase by next summer if its bid is the one approved by the bankruptcy court .
PS of New Hampshire shares closed yesterday at $ 3.75 , off 25 cents , in New York Stock Exchange composite trading .
Manville Corp. said it offered to buy $ 500 million of its convertible preferred stock from the Manville Personal Injury Settlement Trust in a move
that would improve the trust 's liquidity and reduce the potential number of Manville shares outstanding .
Manville said it made the offer within the past several weeks as part of an effort to improve shareholder value .
It said it would purchase the stock at market price .
Manville and a spokeswoman for the trust said that the two are discussing the proposal but a decision has n't been made .
`` We are considering that offer along with all other alternatives , '' the trust spokeswoman said .
`` We need to look at how to maximize our cash flow to pay our beneficiaries .
The trust , created as part of Manville 's bankruptcy-law reorganization to compensate victims of asbestos-related diseases , owns 7.2 million of the Series
A convertible preferred shares , which are each convertible into 10 Manville common shares .
The trust also owns half of Manville 's 48 million common shares outstanding .
Based on Manville 's closing price yesterday of $ 9.25
a share , Manville 's offer would purchase about 5.4 million of its preferred shares , or about 75 % of the trust 's preferred stock holding .
In addition to the stock and 20 % of Manville 's profits beginning in 1992 , the trust is supposed to receive $ 2.5 billion over its 27-year life .
But it initially was funded with about $ 765 million and may soon face a cash crunch .
As of June 30 , it had settled about 15,000 of 81,000 claims filed and its unpaid claims totaled $ 136 million , a large portion of its $ 268 million in cash and marketable securities .
Since most of its assets are tied to Manville , a forest and building products concern , the trust might also want to diversify its holdings .
As part of its offer , Manville said it requested changes in some covenants between it and the trust to allow Manville to `` reflect a more typical corporate ownership and financial structure .
'' A Manville spokesman would n't elaborate on the proposed changes .
But he said they are `` to a large degree , housekeeping , '' although some may generate some disagreement .
Manville said the shares issued to the trust were intended to be sold , as needed , and that Manville has the right of first refusal to buy those shares .
Another fight is brewing between Congress and the Bush administration over how to pay for the savings-and-loan bailout without adding to the federal budget deficit .
In a hearing before the House Ways and Means Committee , the General Accounting Office and the Congressional Budget Office , which
both are arms of Congress , advised the new S&L bailout agency to abandon plans to raise temporary working capital through debt issued from an agency
that would n't be counted on the federal budget .
Officials of the Resolution Trust Corp. have said privately that such a plan was the most likely alternative to raise short-term cash for the bailout .
Instead , the GAO and the Congressional Budget Office said , the RTC should consider using Treasury debt , which is less expensive and subject to oversight by Congress .
The spending could be exempted from meeting deficit-reduction targets in the Gramm-Rudman budget law .
The RTC has projected that it will require between $ 50 billion to $ 100 billion in temporary working capital .
The borrowing to raise these funds would be paid off as assets of sick thrifts are sold .
The new S&L law allows the RTC to issue notes for as much as 85 % of the value of the assets
it holds .
But higher interest rates paid on off-budget debt could add billions to the bailout costs , and would n't be subject to congressional scrutiny , Ways and Means members argued .
`` To allow this massive level of unfettered federal borrowing without prior congressional approval would be irresponsible , '' said Rep. Fortney Stark ( D. , Calif. ) , who has introduced a bill to limit the RTC 's authority to issue debt .
The RTC will have to sell or merge hundreds of insolvent thrifts over the next three years .
The new S&L bailout law allows $ 50 billion to be spent to sell or merge sick S&Ls and their assets , but that is a net cost .
In the meantime , the agency must raise cash to maintain assets , such as real estate , until they can be sold .
Then the short-term debt is paid off through the proceeds of selling the assets .
David Mullins , assistant secretary of the Treasury , said that the working capital is necessary to reduce the final costs of the bailout , by allowing the agency to sell savings and loans without their bad assets , then hold the assets until they can be sold under favorable conditions .
He said it has n't yet been determined how the RTC will raise the cash , but the administration does n't want it to be included on the federal budget , because it would `` distort '' the budget process by requiring either exemptions from Gramm-Rudman or big increases in the budget deficit .
But the worst possibility would be raising no working capital , he said .
`` If working capital financing is not provided , '' he said , `` the RTC may have to slow { S&L sales } or dump acquired assets through fire sales .
Immunex Corp. said its scientists isolated a molecule
which may hold potential as a treatment for disruptions of the immune-system , ranging from organ-transplant rejection , to allergies and asthma .
The molecule is the mouse version of a protein called the interleukin-4 receptor .
IL-4 is a hormone
which directs the growth and function of white blood cells involved in the body 's immune response .
The IL-4 receptor on the surface of such cells receives the hormone 's message to rally the body 's defense .
But in certain conditions such as autoimmune diseases and allergies and transplant rejection , doctors would like to damp the immune response so such cells do n't touch off harmful inflammatory reactions or cell destruction .
A soluble form of the receptor might turn off a specific part of the immune response without general immune suppression , the company said .
The IL-4 receptor is one of five such receptors to be developed and tested by Receptech Corp. , a spinoff of Immunex , through a proposed $ 30 million initial public offering .
Immunex will contract with the spinoff to provide the research , development and initial testing of the new agents .
Immunex will have the option to buy back Receptech shares after five years .

First they get us to buy computers so we can get more information .
Then the computers give us more information than we can ever read .
Now they plan to sell us products
that sift through all the information to give us
what
we really want to know .
The products range from computer-edited , personal newsletters to systems
that sit inside a personal computer and pick stories on selected topics off news wires .
`` Filtered news is what people want , '' says Esther Dyson , editor of Release 1.0 , an industry newsletter
that spots new developments .
`` Most people read 10 times more than necessary in order to find out what
they really need .
Geoffrey Goodfellow , who dropped out of high school back in the 1970s to manage a computer network at a California research firm , says : `` Old network hands have started to turn off the network because they do n't have time to wade through the muck .
'' Mr. Goodfellow has started a Menlo Park , Calif. , company called Anterior Technology
that provides human editors for public electronic networks .
`` I see it as a sewage treatment plant , '' he says .
A new product , NewsEdge , carries five business news wires simultaneously into a user 's computer and beeps and flashes whenever an article appears that is of interest to the user .
The product , developed by Desktop Data Corp. , a new company based in Waltham , Mass. , scans the wires looking for articles
that contain key words specified by the user .
One early user , David Semmel , a Chicago venture capitalist and investor in Desktop Data , says he uses it to track takeover developments .
He says he told NewsEdge to look for stories containing such words as takeover , acquisition , acquire , LBO , tender , merger , junk and halted .
`` I 'm pretty confident I 'm catching everything , '' he says .
NewsEdge is pricey : $ 7,500
a year for a limited version , $ 40,000
a year if the cost of all the news wires is included .
And it works best in high-powered personal computers .
But some investors and consultants
who have tried it are enthusiastic .
Jeffrey Tarter , editor of SoftLetter , a Watertown , Mass. , industry newsletter , says : `` I 've seen a lot of people fooling around on the fringes of filtering information .
This is the first time
I 've seen something
I could imagine a lot of people using .
NewsEdge uses an FM radio band to carry news wires provided by Reuters , McGraw-Hill and Dow Jones & Co. , as well as PR Newswire , which carries corporate press releases .
An FM receiver attached to a user 's personal computer receives the information .
Some organizations have devised their own systems to sort through news wire items as they come in .
George Goodwin , an account manager at Royal Bank of Canada , adapted a Lotus Development Corp. program called Agenda to sort through international news wires .
It automatically selects stories from particular countries for reading by the international bankers responsible for lending in those areas .
For those
who do n't need their personalized information moment by moment , some services are offering overnight newsletters .
Individual Inc. , a new company in Brookline , Mass. , uses filtering technology developed by Cornell University computer scientist Gerard Salton , to automatically produce customized newsletters
it sends electronically to subscribers by 8 a.m.
the next day .
`` We are operating an information refinery
that takes a broad stream of raw data and turns it into actionable knowledge , '' says Yosi Amram , founder and president .
The daily newsletter , which is n't widely available yet , will have a base cost of $ 2,000
a year and provides full text of relevant articles under license agreements with Reuters , McGraw Hill , United Press International , two press release news wires and Japan 's Kyodo news service .
One early user is NEC Corp. 's U.S. printer marketing arm .
`` They want the full press releases on printer announcements by their competition , '' Mr. Amram says .
It also tracks personnel and financial announcements by NEC 's distributors and customers .
Individual Inc. 's technology goes beyond word searches by using a computerized thesaurus .
If a customer asks for stories about `` IBM , '' the computer will also supply stories
that mention `` I.B.M. , International Business Machines , or Big Blue , '' Mr. Amram says .
Moreover , Individual Inc. 's computers can weigh the value of an article based on how closely the story matches the subscriber 's interest area .
It compares the position of key words in the story ; words in the headline or first paragraph get a higher value .
And it calculates how often the words appear in the story compared with how often they appear in the entire data base .
The higher the ratio of hits to total words , the higher the presumed value to the reader .
Pinpoint Information Corp. , Chantilly , Va. , a producer of $ 1,800-a-year personalized newsletters about the computer industry
that started full operation last month , relies on 12 human readers to code news releases by topic in order to select items for each subscriber .
`` The computers find all the key words they can , but the editors confirm every one .
Computer picking is n't perfect , '' says Harvey Golomb , president and founder of Pinpoint .
The humans also write abstracts of articles from some 200 computer industry publications .
Once all the articles are coded and put in a data base , Pinpoint 's computers pick the most relevant for each subscriber and lay them out in a three-to-five-page newsletter format ; each newsletter is sent directly from the computer to the subscriber 's fax machine .
Mr. Golomb says each of his computers can produce and send about 75 unique newsletters
a night .
Many computer network users
who never see news wires would like to sort through their electronic mail automatically .
So-called E-mail is the collection of inter-office memos , gossip , technical data , schedules and directives distributed over local and national computer networks .
`` All these interconnected computers make it difficult to sort out what 's junk and what 's important , '' says Chuck Digate , a former Lotus Development executive
who has started a new company to cope with the problem .
Mr. Digate says his firm , Beyond Inc. , has licensed technology known as Information Lens from Massachusetts Institute of Technology and plans to develop it for commercial use .
The MIT project devised ways for E-mail to be automatically categorized as top priority if it comes from certain designated senders or requires action in the next couple of days .
Mr. Digate says that Beyond will refine the product `` so the message will be smart enough to know to come back and bother you again next week .
'' And if a user is busy , `` he can set it for crisis mode : ` Do n't bother me with reports until Monday .
' ''
A program called Notes , which is under development by Lotus , also is designed to sort E-mail sent within work groups .
One thing
that makes E-mail difficult to sift through is that each item looks the same .
Notes , which is designed for advanced computers that display graphics , allows mail senders to put different logos on their mail .
A daily news briefing from the company librarian , for example , would have a distinctive format on the screen , just as a paper version would have .
`` With E-mail , you do n't have the visual clues of paper , '' says Mr. Tarter , the editor of SoftLetter .
`` With Notes , they 're visually distinct .
Watching Congress sweat and grimace through its annual budget labors , fighting the urge to spend more , we 're reminded of those late-night movies in which
the anguished serial killer turns himself in to police and says , `` Stop me before I kill again .
'' The Members know they 're doing wrong , but they need help to restrain their darker compulsions .
Arkansas Democrat David Pryor spilled his guts on the Senate floor
the other day after he 'd joined the Finance Committee 's early-morning pork-barrel revels : `` I must tell you ...
I come to the floor tonight as one
who ended up with a busload of extraneous matter .
It was nothing more or nothing less than a feeding frenzy .
'' He was turning himself in .
`` Frankly , as I was walking back to get in my car , I heard many , many people ... opening champagne bottles and celebrating individual victories that some of us had accomplished in getting our little deal in the tax bill and winking at this person for slipping this in , '' he said .
`` As I was driving home , I did not feel very good about myself .
We can applaud Mr. Pryor 's moment of epiphany , even as we understand that he and his confreres need restraint lest they kill again .
A good place to start the rehabilitation is a `` legislative line-item veto '' bill now being offered by Indiana Senator Dan Coats .
The Coats bill , which already has 32 Senate co-sponsors , is n't a pure line-item veto because it would apply only to spending bills .
Instead it 's a form of `` enhanced rescission , '' giving a President
a chance to rescind , or strike , specific spending items
that just go too far .
Under the proposal , a President would have a chance twice each year to return a package of `` rescissions '' to the Hill -- once when he proposes his budget and again after Congress disposes .
Congress would have 20 days to reject the package with a 50 % majority , but then a President could veto that rejection .
Congress would then need the usual two-thirds majority to override any veto .
The proposal would restore some discipline erased from the budget process by the 1974 Budget `` Reform '' Act .
Before 1974 , a President could `` impound , '' or refuse to spend , funds appropriated by Congress .
Presidents Kennedy and Johnson were both big users of the impoundment power , but Congress saw its chance against a weakened President Nixon and stripped it away .

a President can still send up spending rescissions , but they 're meaningless unless Congress has a guilty conscience and changes its mind .
This is like asking foxes to feel remorse about chickens , and naturally rescissions are almost never approved .
In 1987 , President Reagan sent 73 rescissions back to the Hill , but only 3 % of the spending total was approved by Congress .
Senator Coats 's proposal would let the proposed spending cuts take place automatically unless Congress acts .
The Members could still try to serve their constituents with special-interest goodies , but the police ( in the form of a President ) would be there with a straitjacket if they really get crazy , as they do now .
Mr. Coats plans to offer his proposal as an amendment to a bill to raise the federal debt limit before the end of the month .
President Bush has endorsed the idea , and at least 50 sitting Senators have voted to support enhanced rescission authority in the past .
We 're told Senator Pryor is n't yet a co-sponsor , but if he and his colleagues are serious about kicking their compulsions , they 'll sign up .
First , the somewhat affected idealism of the 1960s .
Then , the all-too-sincere opportunism of the 1970s and 1980s .
What now ?
To judge from novels
that mirror the contemporary scene , we 're back in the age of anxiety .
Where '60s dropouts professed to scorn middle-class life and ambitious yuppies hoped to leave it far behind as they scaled the upper reaches of success , it now seems that so many people feel they 're slipping between the cracks , that middle-class life is viewed with nostalgia or outright longing .
Lisa Zeidner 's third novel , `` Limited Partnerships '' ( North Point Press , 256 pages , $ 18.95 ) is a stylish , funny and thoughtful look at the way love relationships are affected by the pressures of money , or , more specifically , the lack of it .
Nora Worth and Malcolm DeWitt , 33 and 39 respectively , live together in a townhouse in a transitional Philadelphia neighborhood .
Malcolm , a former film-maker turned architect , has just seen his first big chance at a lucrative commission turn to dust with the arrest of his shady , obnoxious client , a fly-by-night real estate developer .
Nora , who still has artistic aspirations , knows she is lucky to be working as a food stylist , prepping pies , burgers , frosty cold drinks and other comestibles to look as appetizing as possible in front of the camera .
After all , she reasons , `` there were housewives with Nikons and degrees from cooking schools in France
who would kill for her job .
'' But Nora and Malcolm feel trapped .
They seem to be having the `` worst of both
worlds : artistic work with none of art 's integrity and no control over the finished product ; self-employment without fun or profit .
It 's a downbeat , `` thirtysomething '' world , in which
bright , still youngish people are engaged in a glossy version of day labor , doing free-lance , semi-professional work
that brings little satisfaction or security but that they know they should be grateful to do .
Uncertainty dogs
every aspect of their lives .
Malcolm faces bankruptcy and an IRS audit , but Nora finds an extra $ 30,000 in her bank account , suddenly increasing her available funds
some fifteenfold .
While she is wondering whether to live it up , and do something even more dramatic , say get married , her life is further complicated by the reappearance of an old flame , David , a film critic and actor
who always seems to be just on the brink of stardom .
In novels of an earlier vintage , David would have represented excitement and danger ; Malcolm , placid , middle-class security .
The irony in this novel is that neither man represents a `` safe '' middle-class haven : Nora 's decision is between emotional excitement and emotional security , with no firm economic base anywhere .
The characters confront a world in which
it seems increasingly difficult to find a `` middle way '' between the extremes of success and failure , wealth and poverty .
In making Malcolm and Nora such wonderfully representative specimens of their class and generation , Ms. Zeidner has somewhat neglected the task of making them distinctively individual characters .
The humor of the story owes much to the fact that no hearts ( even the characters ' own ) are likely to bleed for the plight of health-food eaters .
But readers may well feel the pangs of recognition .
In any case , the foundering middle classes are n't the only ones in trouble -- or whose troubles provide material for fiction .
`` Rascal Money '' ( Contemporary Books , 412 pages , $ 17.95 ) , a novel by consultant and business analyst Joseph R. Garber , tells the story of an innovative , well-run , widely respected computer manufacturing company called PegaSys as it faces a hostile takeover attempt by AIW , a much smaller corporation
that is so incompetently managed as to constitute a standing joke in the business world .
Patrician , dynamic Scott Thatcher , founder and head of PegaSys , initially finds the takeover threat risible .
But , as he and his skilled team soon discover , they 're up against two factors they had n't counted on : first , a business climate in which
a failing company with few assets and many debts can borrow against the assets of the successful company
it hopes to acquire in order to finance the takeover ; second , that standing behind AIW is a sinister consortium of much bigger , shadier and shrewder foreign interests secretly providing the money and muscle for the deal .
Mr. Garber manages to invest this tale of financial wars with the colorful characters and fast-paced action of a suspense novel .
And like a spy or mystery story , this novel has strong elements of allegory , as the good and evil forces battle it out .
Mr. Garber depicts these moral qualities with the broad brush strokes of a satire
that occasionally descends to the realm of cliched caricatures .
Standard-issue portraits of flaky Californians , snobbish homosexuals and Neanderthal union leaders undermine the force of the author 's perceptions .
Yet the heavy-handedness of the satire also can be effective in a book like this : If the head of AIW were not portrayed as an utterly contemptible , malicious dolt , we would not much care whether his schemes were defeated , and would not be so diverted in the process .

Investors in the over-the-counter market dumped banking and insurance issues , sending the Nasdaq composite index lower for the third consecutive session .
All Nasdaq industry indexes finished lower , with financial issues hit the hardest .
Despite some early computer-guided program buying , the Nasdaq composite fell 1.39 to 451.37 .
The OTC market now has declined in eight of the past 11 sessions .
The Nasdaq bank index fell 5.00 to 432.61 , while the insurance index fell 3.56 to 528.56 , and the `` other finance '' index dropped 3.27 to 529.32 .
The largest financial issues , as measured by the Nasdaq financial index , tumbled 3.23 to
Meanwhile , the index of the 100 biggest non-financial stocks , the Nasdaq 100 , gained 0.47 to 438.15 .
Profit-taking accounted for much of the slide in OTC stock prices , according to David Mills , senior vice president of Boston Company Advisers .
He said many portfolio managers , whose year-end bonuses are tied to annual performance , are selling now rather than risk seeing their gains erode further .
`` The profit locking-in is definitely going on , '' said Mr. Mills , whose firm manages $ 600 million for Boston Co .
Tax-loss sellers , those investors
who sell loss-making stocks so they can deduct their losses from this year 's income , are also getting out , Mr. Mills said .
That 's helping put pressure on both
the market 's winners and its losers .
`` The stocks
that have been the best are having big pullbacks , and the ones
that have been the worst are getting clobbered , '' Mr. Mills said .
He expects the market to sink further and to reach a low sometime next month or in December .
The selling by money managers and individual investors is turning traders bearish as well .
`` We are advising a lot of our clients to make moves
that make sense to them , rather than waiting until the last minute , because things have been so volatile , '' said William Sulya , head of OTC trading at A.G. Edwards & Sons in St. Louis .
Ralph Costanza , head of the OTC trading department at Smith Barney , Harris Upham , said many market players are awaiting some resolution of the current debate over program trading .
Much of the market 's recent volatility has been blamed on this large-scale computerized trading technique
that can send stock prices surging or plummeting in a matter of minutes .
The problem has been particularly damaging to the OTC market , traditionally a base for the small investor .

Two New England banks reported substantial third-quarter net losses , reflecting the continuing woes of the region 's developers and lenders .
One Bancorp , Portland , Maine , buffeted by loan write-downs and expanded loss reserves , reported a net loss of $ 48.5 million , or $ 5.92
In the year-earlier period , the bank holding company reported net income of $ 523,000 , or six cents
Holyoke , Mass.-based Heritage Bancorp , also hurt by the depressed New England real estate market , reported a net loss of $ 8.9 million , or $ 1.22
a share , compared with net income of $ 3 million , or 40 cents
One Bancorp , which had warned that it planned to take a $ 49.8 million loan-loss provision in the third quarter , said it expects things to get worse , but more slowly , in the future .
`` Barring marked and unanticipated declines in real estate values , we expect our growth rates of nonperforming loans to slow , '' Vincent E. Furey Jr. , president and chief executive officer , said .
After taking write-downs of about $ 75 million in the last 12 months , he said the company is in position , `` to address accelerated disposal of problem assets .
One Bancorp 's primary capital-to-asset ratio is 6.6 % after third-quarter charges .
Under federal regulations , a 6 % ratio is the standard .
However , the company said it is n't in compliance with certain standards
it agreed to last fall in connection with two Massachusetts acquisitions .
Mr. Furey said the company is working to restore its capital ratio to regulatory compliance and expects to reach an agreement with regulators during the fourth quarter .
He said he expects a formal written agreement documenting One Bancorp 's plan to reduce problem assets and return to compliance .
The third-quarter loss reflected a $ 49.8 million provision for loan losses and write-downs of $ 8.5 million on foreclosed real estate .
One Bancorp said its loan-loss reserve of $ 59.4 million at Sept. 30 was 2.9 % of loans outstanding and 35 % of $ 170 million in nonperforming loans .
At June 30 , reserves of $ 52.2 million were 2.4 % of loans outstanding and 35 % of $ 150 million in nonperforming loans .
Loan and real-estate write-downs have reduced $ 195 million in nonperforming assets by 28 % from their original loan value , One Bancorp said .
Nonperforming assets consist of $ 170 million in nonperforming loans and $ 25 million in real estate acquired by agreement or foreclosure .
As a result of the losses , stockholders ' equity declined to $ 76.6 million , or $ 9.35
a share , at Sept. 30 , from $ 125.1 million , or $ 15.27
a share , at June 30 .
For the first nine months of 1989 , net losses at One Bancorp totaled $ 74.5 million , or $ 9.12
a share , compared to net income of $ 9.7 million , or $ 1.13
a share , in the year-earlier period .
Heritage Bancorp said it added $ 17 million to its loan-loss reserve , making the reserve $ 24.7 million or 1.6 % of total loans and 35 % of nonperforming loans .
Nonperforming loans increased from $ 32.2 million as of June 30 , 1988 , to $ 69.6 million as of Sept. 30 , 1989 .
Assets at Sept. 30 totaled $ 1.73 billion .
Chairman Richard B. Covell said he expects that Heritage will rebound in the fourth quarter and return to a positive mode of operation in 1990 .
`` We are aggressively pursuing workout strategies with respect to nonperforming assets in an effort to resolve these problems as expeditiously as possible , while simultaneously minimizing losses to the company , '' he said .
For the nine months , Heritage reported a net loss of $ 10.9 million , or $ 1.49
a share , compared to net income of $ 8.3 million , or $ 1.12
a share .

European Community employers fear that the EC Commission 's plans for a `` charter of fundamental social rights '' is a danger to industrial competitiveness .
`` We do n't want Brussels deciding conditions for workers unless they are necessary and useful , '' said Zygmunt Tyszkiewicz , secretary general of the employers ' confederation Unice .
Unice -- an acronym for the Union of Industrial and Employers ' Confederations of Europe -- fears that the charter will force EC countries to adopt a single pattern in labor relations .
Workers and management , Mr. Tyszkiewicz said , would lose the `` flexibility and diversity '' that has so far allowed them to adapt to local conditions and traditions .
The British government also strongly opposes the charter in its current form .
It argues , as does Unice , that labor relations are best left to be regulated at the national level .
France will propose a slightly watered-down version of the charter to be discussed by EC social-affairs ministers on Monday , officials said .
But the cosmetic changes are n't expected to win over Britain .
`` We still have serious differences with the text , '' a British official said , because it provides for a `` regulation of the labor market .
Mr. Tyszkiewicz said the charter would put poorer EC countries such as Spain , Greece and Portugal at a disadvantage .
It would force these countries to introduce minimum standards for pay and working hours , and provide for collective bargaining and worker `` participation '' in major corporate decisions .
This , he warned , would prevent these countries from bridging the difference with their richer EC brethren .
Indeed , lower wages -- in Greece , they are a third of the EC average -- are n't enough to offset higher transport costs and lower productivity in the southern countries .
Increasing labor costs , Mr. Tyszkiewicz argued , would only put the countries at a further disadvantage in competing in the barrier-free EC market planned for after 1992 .
But the Unice official said that producing a charter acceptable to both Britain and European industry is n't an unattainable goal .
The charter would just have to be restricted to a list of workers ' fundamental rights , without seeking to impose any norms .
A key provision in the current version of the charter would give the commission
a mandate to produce an `` action program '' detailing on what points EC member states would be required to comply with the goals set out in the charter .
This provision lies at the heart of the British and Unice fears of `` social engineering '' by the commission .
One possible political solution , an EC official said , would be for the commission to present the action program in late November , before the adoption of the charter at a summit of EC governments on Dec. 8 and 9 .
This would leave Britain free to adopt the charter after having rebutted the action program .
The charter was approved by the EC Commission on Sept. 21 .
France 's Socialist government , which currently holds the council 's rotating presidency , is committed to having the charter adopted by all 12 EC states before the end of 1989 -- the bicentennial of the French revolution and its `` Universal Declaration of Human Rights .

Two leading constitutional-law experts said President Bush does n't have the legal authority to exercise a line-item veto .
Professors Philip Kurland of the University of Chicago and Laurence Tribe of Harvard Law School said any effort by President Bush to claim authority for a line-item veto would contradict the text of the Constitution and the intent of its authors , as well as the views of previous presidents .
A line-item veto is a procedure
that would allow a president to veto part of a big congressional spending bill without having to scuttle the entire measure .
Mr. Bush has said he would like to be able to use this procedure .
A White House spokesman said last week that the president is considering declaring that the Constitution implicitly gives him
the authority for a line-item veto to provoke a test case .
But the two legal experts , responding to an inquiry by Sen. Edward Kennedy ( D. , Mass. ) , wrote in a joint letter that the president `` lacks the constitutional authority to exercise a line-item veto .
'' The two professors represent different ends of the political spectrum -- Mr. Kurland is a conservative and Mr. Tribe is a liberal .
The two professors said the Constitution authorizes the president to veto entire bills , not partial measures .
Moreover , they said the first appropriations bill passed 200 years ago covered many different items , and there was no discussion of a line-item veto .
They also said that more than a dozen presidents have called for line-item veto authority since the Civil War , and `` all have shared the view that such lawmaking power is beyond the reach '' of the president .
Sen. Kennedy said in a separate statement that he supports legislation to give the president line-item veto power , but that it would be a `` reckless course of action '' for President Bush to claim the authority without congressional approval .
The head of the nation 's largest car-dealers group is telling dealers to `` just say no '' when auto makers pressure them to stockpile cars on their lots .
In an open letter
that will run today in the trade journal Automotive News , Ron Tonkin , president of the National Car Dealers Association , says dealers should cut their inventories to no more than half the level traditionally considered desirable .
Mr. Tonkin , who has been feuding with the Big Three since he took office earlier this year , said that with half of the nation 's dealers losing money or breaking even , it was time for `` emergency action .
U.S. car dealers had an average of 59 days ' supply of cars in their lots at the end of September , according to Ward 's Automotive Reports .
But Mr. Tonkin said dealers should slash stocks to between 15 and 30 days to reduce the costs of financing inventory .
His message is getting a chilly reception in Detroit , where the Big Three auto makers are already being forced to close plants because of soft sales and reduced dealer orders .
Even before Mr. Tonkin 's broadside , some large dealers said they were cutting inventories .
Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. representatives criticized Mr. Tonkin 's plan as unworkable .
It `` is going to sound neat to the dealer except when his 15-day car supply does n't include the bright red one that the lady wants to buy and she goes up the street to buy one , '' a Chrysler spokesman said .
Telerate Inc. , which has rejected an $ 18-a-share tender offer by Dow Jones & Co. for the 33 % of Telerate that Dow Jones does n't already own , said the two companies began talks yesterday to try to negotiate a friendly transaction .
However , the talks did n't produce any changes in the $ 576 million Dow Jones offer , which
a committee of Telerate 's two independent directors has rejected as inadequate .
Peter Skinner , vice president and corporate general counsel for Dow Jones , said yesterday 's talks took place
both on the telephone and in person .
`` We discussed the bid , but Dow Jones and its board of directors believe the bid is full and fair , '' Mr. Skinner said .
He said no future talks are currently scheduled , but added that Dow Jones representatives will meet again with Telerate officials if Telerate seeks a meeting .
Telerate disclosed the opening of negotiations in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission , which said that `` there can be no assurance that such negotiations will continue or will result in revised terms
that will be satisfactory to the special committee .
The talks followed an effort by Telerate to place a strongly worded advertisement attacking the Dow Jones offer in yesterday 's editions of The Wall Street Journal , according to two people familiar with Telerate .
After Telerate submitted its ad to the Journal Wednesday , the people said , a lawyer for Dow Jones telephoned a Telerate lawyer .
Soon thereafter , Warren H. Phillips , chairman of Dow Jones , telephoned Neil S. Hirsch , chairman of Telerate .
As a result of the conversations , the people said , Telerate decided not to run the ad yesterday , and Dow Jones agreed to meet with Telerate .
Mr. Skinner said that Dow Jones executives had been told that the ad would be submitted by Telerate and were advised of its content .
The Dow Jones executives indicated to Telerate executives that such an ad would not be `` helpful , '' Mr. Skinner said , and Telerate decided not to run the ad .
A spokesman for Telerate declined to elaborate on Telerate 's filing with the SEC .
Telerate stock rose 87.5 cents to close at $ 20.50 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday .
Dow Jones fell 62.5 cents to close at $ 36.625 .
Many of Wall Street 's takeover-stock speculators bought relatively large positions in Telerate stock after Dow Jones announced its tender offer on Sept. 21 .
The traders are betting Dow Jones will increase its $ 18-a-share offer in order to acquire full ownership of Telerate , an electronic distributor of financial-market information .
Several takeover stock traders said yesterday they expect Dow Jones to offer at least $ 21 .
Some analysts , investment bankers and institutional investors
who have studied Telerate have said they believe the company could fetch between $ 25 and $ 30
a share if it were put up for auction .
But the takeover stock traders , who declined to be identified , said they believe it is unrealistic to expect Dow Jones will pay that much , considering it already owns about 67 % of Telerate .
Bruce Thorp , an analyst at Philadelphia-based Provident National Bank , said Dow Jones 's tender offer reflects a typical premium for the purchase of a remaining minority stake .
He thinks Dow Jones will end up paying $ 20 or $ 21
a share for Telerate .
`` The offer will be sweetened , not because it has to be , but because it will make for a smoother transaction , '' Mr. Thorp said .
`` Dow Jones could bludgeon its way through the process and get it for less , but they wo n't do that .
Dow Jones is not going to squeeze as hard as it could .
Dow Jones declined to comment on Mr. Thorp 's speculation .
Telerate 's proposed ad , headlined `` What Now , Dow Jones ? '' was in the form of a letter to Dow Jones directors .
`` How can a company of Dow Jones 's reputation persist in a coercive attempt to squeeze out the minority shareholders of Telerate at a low-ball price of $ 18
a share ? '' the ad asked .
A copy of the ad was obtained from a person familiar with Telerate .
`` We are forced to consider Dow Jones 's actions as hostile -- to Telerate 's shareholders , management , and employees , '' the ad said .
It was signed by Mr. Hirsch , three other Telerate directors
who are employees of Telerate , and two outside directors .
People familiar with Telerate said the ad was intended to encourage Dow Jones to begin negotiations and was submitted to the Journal for that reason .
`` We could have run it in the New York Times , '' one person familiar with Telerate said .
As evidence of their contention that the current Dow Jones offer is too low , takeover-stock speculators pointed to an SEC filing by Dow Jones disclosing that Dow Jones managers had proposed offering $ 19
However , that proposal was overruled by Dow Jones 's board , which decided to offer $ 18
After the Telerate special committee rejected the Dow Jones offer as inadequate , Mr. Phillips of Dow Jones said , `` We are proceeding with our $ 18-a-share offer and continue to believe that the offer is fair to all Telerate stockholders .
'' The offer is scheduled to expire Nov. 3 .
Separately , a hearing is scheduled for Monday in Delaware Chancery Court on a motion by certain Telerate shareholders seeking a court order to block the Dow Jones tender offer .
Dow Jones paid between $ 10 and $ 15
a share for most of the 63.6 million Telerate shares
it owns .
The shares were purchased in various transactions , starting in August 1985 .
However , Dow Jones paid $ 28.75
a share for one block of about 10.5 million Telerate shares in September 1987 .
That price represented a premium of 16.8 % above the then-market price of Telerate shares .
In addition to The Wall Street Journal , Dow Jones publishes Barron 's , various community newspapers , and operates financial news services and computer databases .
Steel jackets of a type
that may have prevented collapse of the columns of a 1.5-mile stretch of the Nimitz Freeway had been installed on at least a small test section of the double-decker highway last year by California 's Department of Transportation , employees familiar with the project say .
The test project -- which reportedly survived Tuesday 's earthquake -- was a prelude to a state plan to retrofit that critical section of the freeway with the steel casings .
State engineers have made a preliminary finding that it was failure of the concrete columns , wrenched and separated from the double-decker roadbed , that was responsible for the collapse .
The failure in Oakland of the freeway segment known as the Cypress structure was the deadliest aspect of the quake , although officials were hopeful yesterday that the death toll
there might be significantly lower than the 250 initially feared .
Sorting out the wreckage is expected to take several days .
Red tractors gingerly picked at the rubble while jackhammers tried to break up some of the massive slabs of concrete .
Giant yellow cranes were wheeled up alongside the collapsed segment , preparing to lift off chunks of the debris .
In Sacramento , a transportation department spokesman said he could n't immediately confirm or deny existence of the test work .
However , he asserted that the department had n't mastered the technology needed to retrofit the entire Cypress structure .
Moreover , other officials noted , snafus in transportation funding that the state has experienced over the years may have restricted the availability of funds for such a retrofitting , even if it were technologically feasible .
Knowledgeable employees said the retrofitting , which had n't yet been budgeted , was part of a planned , three-stage reinforcement of the Cypress structure begun by the California transportation department several years ago .
The Cypress reinforcement project
itself was part of an annual effort to shore up structures believed vulnerable to earthquakes .
The state began such work after a 1971 tremblor in Southern California , when numerous bridges collapsed .
`` We had just finished phase two '' of the Cypress project
that involved installing a series of retaining cables designed to prevent sections of the roadway from separating as a result of seismic shock , a state DOT engineer said .
After completing installation of the jackets on `` one frame '' of the freeway last year , the state DOT had sent the project over to its Sacramento engineers to draw up a final design .
Knowledgeable employees said the project had been stymied somewhat by `` the difficulty of designing '' the jackets .
The procedure involves encasing the concrete columns with steel , then connecting them more securely to the double-decker roadbed .
The employees also said the project may have been snagged by budgetary concerns .
One preliminary estimate put the retrofitting cost at as much as $ 50 million .
The collapse of the span has provoked surprise and anger among state officials .
Gov. George Deukmejian , who said he had been assured by state transportation officials that the structure could withstand an even larger quake , called for an immediate investigation .
`` I want to know who made the decision that it was safe for 186,000 people to use every day , '' said Richard Katz , a state legislator
who is chairman of the California Assembly 's transportation committee .
He said he would convene hearings within two weeks .
The Cypress structure opened in June 1957 , and as such , like many buildings in the San Francisco Bay area , does not meet current building codes requiring considerably more steel support .
The northern piers of the span lie in estuarian deposits
that were of a type to have liquefied easily during the 1906 quake .
Transportation department officials , however , said they were as surprised as anyone by the Cypress destruction .
They said previous earthquakes suggested that multiple-column viaducts would stand up well , although they were working on ways to bolster them .
`` Unfortunately , there is only one laboratory for developing techniques to withstand earthquakes , and that is an earthquake , '' said Burch Bachtold , San Francisco district director for the transportation department .
He said : `` We know of no technology
that exists anywhere in the world
that would allow us to '' reinforce the columns .

Renaissance , a Cincinnati-based money manager , began buying stocks again this week with half of the $ 1.8 billion that it oversees for clients , according to people familiar with the firm 's revised strategy .
It was the first time since January that Renaissance has thought stocks are worth owning .
Renaissance declined to confirm the move , but its stock purchases were thought to have begun Tuesday , timed to coincide with the maturity
this week of Treasury bills owned by the firm .
The other half of its portfolio is expected to remain invested in Treasury bills for the time being .
Wall Street executives said they believed that Renaissance 's $ 900 million buy program was carried out by PaineWebber Inc .
As reported , PaineWebber bought shares Tuesday as part of a customer strategy shift , although the broker 's client was said then to have been Japanese .
Yesterday , PaineWebber declined comment .
When it owns stocks , Renaissance 's portfolio typically is composed of about 60 large-capitalization issues ; to make buy or sell moves , the firm solicits Wall Street brokerage houses a day or so in advance , looking for the best package price to carry out the trades .
The broker winning the business does n't charge commissions , but instead profits by buying or selling for less than the overall package price .
That puts the broker at risk if it 's trying to buy stock in a rising market .
In Tuesday 's gyrating session , the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 80 points early in the day , but finished with less than a four-point loss .
Renaissance 's last portfolio shift , carried out by Goldman , Sachs & Co. , was a highly publicized decision last January to sell its entire stock portfolio and buy Treasury bills .
The sell signal , which sent a bearish chill through the stock market , came when Renaissance 's computer found that stocks were overpriced compared with bonds and Treasury bills .
At the time , the Dow Jones Industrial Average stood at about 2200 .
The Dow average now stands more than 20 % higher , while Renaissance 's portfolio of Treasurys produced a return of about 6 % through the first three quarters of the year .
The computer 's miscalculation has been painful for Renaissance .
Almost any money manager holding stocks has turned in better results , while Renaissance has played it safe with Treasury bills .
So why does Renaissance 's computer like stocks with the Dow at 2653.28 , where it closed yesterday , when it did n't with the Dow at 2200 ?
`` With the decline in stock prices and continued low or stable interest rates , stocks are representing a better value
all the time , '' Renaissance President Frank W. Terrizzi said yesterday .
Three-month T-bill yields have fallen to 7.8 % from about 9 % at the start of the year .
Stock prices , meanwhile , are about 140 points lower than the peak of 2791.41 reached on the Dow industrial average Oct. 9 .
Are those declines enough to signal a partial return to stocks ?
Mr. Terrizzi wo n't say specifically , explaining that if there was such a move , it would take about three days to complete the loose ends of the transaction .
During that time , a buyer with the clout of a Renaissance could end up driving up the price of stocks
it was trying to buy if it tipped its hand .
But everything is relative to Mr. Terrizzi , so stocks in his view can become more attractive in comparison with bonds or T-bills , even if shares are more expensive than when they were sold in January .
`` Our { computer } model has a certain trigger point , '' he said .
When the computer says switch , Renaissance switches .
The firm has made 17 previous shifts from one type of asset to another in its 10-year history .
Almost all have involved at least half and often the firm 's entire portfolio , as the computer searches for the most undervalued investment category , following a money-management style called tactical asset allocation .
Competing asset-allocation firms march to their own computer models , so some have been partly or fully invested in stocks
this year while Renaissance has sat on the sidelines .
As a result , competitors say Renaissance has been looking for any opportunity to return to the stock market , rather than risk losing business by continuing to remain fully invested in Treasury bills .
Mr. Terrizzi confirms some clients have left Renaissance , but no major ones , and the firm has added new accounts .
THE SALES PITCH could n't sound better .
First , there 's the name : `` asset-backed securities .
'' Better than all those offers you get to buy securities backed by nothing .
And there 's more .
The assets backing the securities come from some of the country 's biggest -- and most secure -- institutions .
Most earn high ratings from credit agencies .
Their yields are higher than those of U.S. Treasury issues .
And the booming market has already attracted many of the nation 's biggest institutional investors .
Ready to jump ?
Well , think twice .
The concept may be simple : Take a bunch of loans , tie them up in one neat package , and sell pieces of the package to investors .
But the simplicity may be misleading .
Skeptics say the slightly higher returns are n't enough to compensate for the extra risk .
They warn that asset-backed securities are only as good as the assets and credit backing
that support them -- and those are hard to evaluate .
Moreover , the securities were introduced only about 4 1\/2 years ago ; the biggest unknown is how they will fare in a recession .
`` A lot of this stuff really is in untested waters , '' says Owen Carney , director of the investment securities division of the U.S. comptroller of the currency .
`` We do n't know how this whole market will work in a serious economic downturn .
Such concerns , however , have n't stopped asset-backed securities from becoming one of Wall Street 's hottest new products .
Since the spring of 1985 , financial alchemists have transformed a wide variety of debt into these new securities .
They have sold issues backed by car loans , boat loans and recreational-vehicle loans .
They have offered bundles of homeequity loans , as well as packages of loans used to buy vacation time-shares .
Last year , there was an issue of `` death-backed bonds '' -- securities backed by loans to life-insurance policyholders .
Some predict there will be `` Third World bonds , '' backed by loans to Brazil , Argentina and other debt-ridden nations .
And the biggest volume
this year has been on securities backed by credit-card receivables , sometimes known as `` plastic bonds .
`` This is the heyday of debt , '' says James Grant , editor of Grant 's Interest Rate Observer , a newsletter .
`` Before the sun sets on the '80s , it seems nothing will be left unhocked .
The result is a $ 45 billion market , according to Securities Data Co .
That includes more than $ 9.5 billion issued through August of this year , up sharply from $ 6.5 billion in the comparable 1988 period -- and more than in all of 1987 .
Most issues have been sold to professional money managers , pension funds , bank trust departments and other institutions .
But wealthy individuals also have been jumping in , and lately brokers have been pushing smaller investors into the asset-backed market .
The entry fee is affordable : Issues typically are sold in minimum denominations of $ 1,000 .
`` We expect additional offerings '' of asset-backed securities targeted toward individual investors , says Bill Addiss , a senior vice president at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc .
The process typically begins when an institution , such as Citibank or Sears , Roebuck & Co. , takes a pool of credit-card or other receivables and sells them to a specially created trust .
The trust then issues securities -- generally due in five years or less -- that are underwritten by Wall Street brokerage firms and offered to investors .
Issues typically come with `` credit enhancements , '' such as a bank letter of credit , and thus have received high credit ratings .
Enthusiasts say the booming market has opened up a valuable new source of funds to issuers , while providing a valuable new investment for individuals and institutions .
Asset-backed securities `` are an attractive investment compared to bank certificates of deposit or other corporate bonds , '' says Craig J. Goldberg , managing director and head of the asset-backed securities group at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets .
But skeptics question whether asset-backed bonds offer sufficient rewards to compensate for the extra risks .
Consider a $ 500 million offering of 9 % securities issued last spring and backed by Citibank credit-card receivables .
The triple-A-rated issue offered a yield of only about 0.5 percentage point above four-year Treasury issues .
On a $ 10,000 investment , that 's a difference of only $ 50
a year .
That kind of spread can be critical for money managers
who buy bonds in large quantities and whose livelihood depends on outperforming the money manager across the street .
But for individuals
who buy much smaller amounts and care less about relative performance than in preserving what
they have , that margin is meaningless .
`` If you 're in the bond business playing the relative-performance derby , then even an extra 25 basis points ( 0.25 percentage point ) becomes an important consideration on a career basis , '' says Mr. Grant .
`` But if you 're an individual investing money and trying to get it back again , then that is n't of overwhelming importance .
Moreover , the interest on asset-backed securities is fully taxable , while interest on Treasury issues is tax-free at the state and local level .
That 's why some investment managers , such as Alex Powers , a vice president of Chase Manhattan Bank 's private banking division , do n't recommend most asset-backed issues for individuals in high-tax states , such as New York or California .
But Mr. Powers has purchased asset-backed issues for individuals with tax-deferred accounts , such as retirement plans .
He points out that institutions buying asset-backed issues in large quantities can earn higher spreads over Treasurys than individuals buying smaller amounts .
Another concern is liquidity , or how easily a security can be converted into cash .
The secondary , or resale , market for asset-backed securities is relatively new and much less active than for Treasury issues .
That could make it tricky for investors
who need to sell their holdings quickly before the securities mature .
That 's particularly true , analysts say , for certain of the securities , such as those backed by time-share loans .
`` You could see massive gyrations here because it 's such a thinly traded market , '' says Jonathan S. Paris , a vice president of European Investors Inc. , a New York investment-management firm .
In addition , an investor
who wants to know the daily value of Treasury bonds , or corporate bonds traded on the New York Stock Exchange , can simply check newspaper listings .
There are n't any such listings for asset-backed securities .
Evaluating asset-backed securities poses another problem .
Investors , for instance , may mistakenly assume that the bank or company
that originally held the assets is guaranteeing the securities .
It is n't .
The front cover of the prospectus for the Citibank credit-card receivables offering points out in bold capital letters that the certificates represent an interest only in the specially created trust and `` do not represent interests in or obligations of the banks , Citibank N.A. , Citicorp or any affiliate thereof .
'' In other words , if there 's a problem , do n't expect Citibank to come to the rescue .
The prospectus also notes that the securities are not guaranteed by any government agency .
That means investors have to focus on the quality of the debt
that lies beneath the securities , as well as on the credit enhancement for the issue and the credit ratings
the issue has received .
That also is n't easy .
Take the `` credit enhancements , '' which typically include a bank letter of credit or insurance from a bond-insurance company .
The letter of credit typically is not offered by the bank selling the assets to back the securities .
Nor does it cover the entire portfolio .
Details of credit enhancements vary widely from issue to issue .
Still , they play a crucial role in winning top ratings for most asset-backed issues -- which in turn is why the yield above Treasurys is so slim .
But skeptics ask why you should bother buying this stuff when you can get only slightly lower yields on government-guaranteed paper .
When you buy an asset-backed issue , you take the risk that a bank or an insurer could run into unexpected difficulties .
If a bank 's credit rating was lowered because of , say , its loans to Third World nations , that could also affect the ratings , liquidity and prices of the asset-backed issues that the bank supports .
Underwriters insist these issues are constructed to withstand extremely tough economic conditions .
But despite the credit enhancements , despite the high ratings , some money managers still worry that a recession could wreak havoc on the underlying assets .
At a time when Americans are leveraged to their eyeballs , asset-backed investors may be taking a heady gamble that consumers will be able to repay loans in hard times .
At the very least , a recession would prompt investors to buy the highest-quality bonds they can find -- that is , Treasurys .
That could widen the yield spread between Treasurys and asset-backed securities , as well as make it tougher to unload the latter .
But it could be much worse .
Some analysts are especially wary of credit-card issues .
For one thing , credit-card loans are unsecured .
In addition , they fear that banks have been overeager to issue cards to the public -- giving cards to too many big spenders
who will default during a recession .
`` A day of reckoning is coming where we think the market will place a high premium on the highest-quality debt issues , and therefore we think the best debt investment is U.S. government bonds , '' says Craig Corcoran of Davis\/Zweig Futures Inc. , an investment advisory firm .
What about triple-A-rated asset-backed issues ?
`` Nope , we still say to stick with Treasurys , '' Mr. Corcoran replies .
Ratings , he notes , `` are subject to change .
All this makes asset-backed securities seem too risky for many people .
And it reminds Raymond F. DeVoe Jr. , a market strategist at Legg Mason Wood Walker Inc. , of what
he calls `` DeVoe 's Unprovable but Highly Probable Theory No. 1 :
`` More money has been lost reaching for yield than in all the stock speculations , scams and frauds of all time .

Falcon Cable Systems Co. said it proposed an amendment
that would allow it to increase its debt cap to 65 % of the company 's fair market value from the 40 % currently allowed .
Falcon , a limited partnership , said it wanted the increase in order to continue its $ 2.15-per-unit annual payment , and for expansion and acquisitions .
A spokesman for the company said a meeting would be held for shareholders to vote on the amendment before year 's end .
Varian Associates Inc. , Palo Alto , Calif. , reported fiscal fourth-quarter profit plunged more than 95 % to $ 1 million , or five cents
a share , from $ 24.2 million , or $ 1.10
a share , in the year-earlier quarter .
The diversified electronics company blamed the decline in the quarter ended Sept. 29 , on previously reported operating problems in its Electron Devices & Systems Group .
For the full fiscal year , Varian posted a 13 % profit rise to $ 31.5 million , or $ 1.53
a share , up from $ 27.8 million , or $ 1.27
a share , last year .
Sales for the year rose almost 15 % to $ 1.34 billion from $ 1.17 billion last year .
A profit last year in both
the quarter and year included a net gain of $ 9.6 million , or 44 cents
a share , from the sale of a division .
Additionally , the full-year profit last year reflected an after-tax restructuring charge of $ 22.8 million , or $ 1.04
Shares of Varian , which
last month warned there would be a fourth-quarter plunge , closed at $ 22.75 , down 62.5 cents in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange .
Sales rose 18 % in the fiscal fourth quarter to $ 364.1 million from $ 307.9 million on the strength in semiconductors and other products .
GenCorp Inc. , hurt by a plant accident and other unexpected costs , said it expects to report that fiscal fourth-quarter profit from continuing operations will be significantly below last year 's $ 25 million .
The Fairlawn , Ohio-based company also said that full-year profit from continuing operations will be far below last year 's $ 148 million .
Last year 's figures include a one-time loss of $ 12 million for restructuring and unusual items .
But the automotive parts and aerospace concern expects that net for the year ending Nov. 30 will exceed last fiscal year 's net of $ 70 million , or $ 2.19
a share , primarily because of $ 200 million in gains from sales of discontinued operations .
Harry Millis , an analyst at McDonald & Co. in Cleveland , said GenCorp 's unanticipated losses come largely from an accident at a government-owned assembly plant in Kansas , run by a private subcontractor , that makes cluster bombs for GenCorp 's Aerojet Ordnance business .
Transamerica Corp. , San Francisco , said third-quarter profit was essentially flat despite a large one-time gain a year earlier .
The insurance and financial services concern said profit for the quarter rose 1.1 % to $ 93.9 million , or $ 1.19
a share , compared with $ 92.9 million , or $ 1.18
a share , the year earlier .
The results reflected a 24 % gain in income from its finance businesses , and a 15 % slide in income from insurance operations .
Transamerica said third-quarter investment gains were $ 10.2 million , compared with $ 6.4 million
the year earlier .
It said insurance profit reflected a $ 6 million loss from Hurricane Hugo .
It also estimated that losses from the Oct. 17 earthquake in California would be no more than $ 6 million , and would be included in fourth-quarter results .
We are deeply disturbed that a recent editorial stated that the `` Americans With Disabilities Act of 1989 '' was `` crafted primarily by Democratic Senators Kennedy and Harkin '' with a premise `` based on the presumption that most Americans are hostile to the disabled ... .
'' Perhaps even more offensive is the statement , `` It is surprising that George Bush and the White House inner circle would ally themselves with this crabby philosophy .
This legislation was not drafted by a handful of Democratic `` do-gooders .
'' Quite the contrary -- it results from years of work by members of the National Council on the Handicapped , all appointed by President Reagan .
You depict the bill as something
Democratic leaders `` hoodwinked '' the administration into endorsing .
The opposite is true : It 's the product of many meetings with administration officials , Senate staffers , advocates , and business and transportation officials .
Many congressmen are citing the compromise on the `` Americans With Disabilities Act of 1989 '' as a model for bipartisan deliberations .
Most National Council members are themselves disabled or are parents of children with disabilities .
We know firsthand the discrimination addressed by the act : to be told there 's no place for your child in school ; to spend lonely hours at home because there is no transportation for someone in a wheelchair ; to be denied employment because you are disabled .
Your editorial mockingly entitles this legislation
the `` Lawyers ' Employment Act .
'' For the 43 million people with disabilities and their families , this legislation is the `` Emancipation Proclamation .

Contrary to what might be expected based on the headline on John R. Dorfman 's recent Money Matters article ( `` Pros Hit Theorists Right Where It
Hurts '' Oct. 3 ) , I was able to stand proudly before my undergraduate finance students and proclaim that the findings of your yearlong experiment on stock picking is completely consistent with what
they have been taught in the classroom .
In particular , I do not find the fact that your group of pros ' monthly selections of four stocks outperforms the market in general to be inconsistent with market efficiency .
Mr. Dorfman states that an investor
who invested $ 100,000
a year ago in the first four stocks selected by your pros and then sold those
one
month later , purchasing the four new pro picks , and repeated this process for the year would have accumulated $ 166,537 , excluding account dividends , taxes and commissions .
In contrast , an investor holding the Dow Jones portfolio over the year would have accumulated only $ 127,446 .
Accepted theories of asset pricing offer a perfectly legitimate explanation .
Accepted theories state that investors require higher returns on riskier investments .
Thus , rather than seeing the excess returns to the pro-selected portfolio as being abnormal , I see those returns as simply compensations for taking on added risk .
I believe the risk for each individual stock selected by your pros is very large .
If you asked me to select a stock with the highest expected return , I would select a stock with the greatest amount of undiversifiable risk , as I am sure your pros do .
Your hypothetical investor is simply being compensated for taking on this added risk .
Moreover , your hypothetical investor has forsaken the gains to be had in reducing risk by diversifying his portfolio .
A four-stock portfolio is still exposed to a great deal of unnecessary risk .
This means the returns can vary a great deal .
Mr. Dorfman provides confirming evidence of this phenomenon when he reports that your staff of dart throwers would have accumulated only $ 112,383 by randomly selecting four new stocks to be held in a portfolio
each month .

Your Investment Dartboard article misses the target .
The fact that stock pickers have bested a randomly selected portfolio in eight of 12 months has no bearing on the efficient-market theory .
What matters is that the stocks recommended by your pros tend to be substantially riskier than a diversified portfolio .
For example , your pickers ' recommendations for the coming month are , on average , 22.5 % riskier than holding the market portfolio according to Value Line 's Beta estimates .
James Morgan 's pick for October -- Dynascan -- is a substantial 35 % riskier than the market portfolio ; his lauded Thermo Electron pick is 40 % riskier .

Critics of program trading are calling increasingly for regulators to raise the cost of trading stock-index futures .
The idea : Boost the amount of cash required initially to buy or sell a stock-index futures contract from the relatively low current level of about 7 % of the contract 's value to as much as 50 % , the same amount investors must put up to buy stocks .
Such a move would curb speculation in stock-index futures , the critics contend , and that would stop the stock market 's breathtaking surges and plunges .
But futures traders here argue this cure is worse than the volatility disease .
They warn that raising the costs of trading futures could backfire and end up making stocks even more volatile .
The debate over program trading is tearing Wall Street asunder .
Critics are much more aggressive than they were in 1987 , the last time
the controversy raged this heatedly .
They 're also more effective .
Several big Wall Street securities firms have bowed to pressure and pulled back in recent days from stock-index arbitrage , the form of program trading that many accuse of amplifying , if not actually causing , stock-market volatility .
In stock-index arbitrage , computer-assisted traders buy and sell large amounts of stock with offsetting trades in stock-index futures , profiting from fleeting price discrepancies between the two markets .
The 190-point plunge in the Dow Jones Industrial Average Oct. 13 , followed by an 80-point rebound in the next trading session , set off the current outcry against program trading .
Chicago futures traders , knowing they ca n't escape the critics ' wrath , are bracing for trouble .
They got a taste of it yesterday morning in full-page ads in major newspapers , including this paper , in which
Neuberger & Berman , a big money New York manager , demanded federal regulators `` immediately '' boost margins on stock-index futures to 50 % .
The term `` margin '' has slightly different meanings in the stock and futures markets , but they
both describe the amount of cash investors must put up to get into the game .
Stock margins are literally down payments made toward the purchase of a stock , and the level is set by the Federal Reserve Board .
In the futures market , a margin payment is simply a good faith deposit .
Each exchange sets its own minimums , with oversight by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission .
Margin requirements loom large in the program trading debate .
Because a trader can control $ 100 in market value for $ 7 cash in the futures market -- rather than for $ 50 in the stock market -- critics contend that speculation is encouraged to a degree
that would be prohibitively expensive in stocks alone .
And with the markets linked so closely through arbitrage , speculation in futures is translated quickly into stocks .
But raising stock-index futures margins could make the stock market even more volatile , futures traders contend .
Higher margins would price many professional speculators -- whose trades help futures markets function smoothly -- out of business .
If these speculators ca n't afford to trade as actively as before , stock-index futures prices , and therefore stock prices , may have to fall further than they might otherwise to attract buyers .
`` If you drive away the specs , then prices will fall in both
futures and stocks , '' declared the head of one Chicago Mercantile Exchange member firm
who asked not to be named , reflecting the highly charged debate over program trading .
Another consequence of driving out speculators here , traders say , could be to widen the momentary price differences between stocks and stock-index futures
that entice index arbitragers in the first place .
That could trigger wide price swings and more , not less , stock-index arbitrage .
`` If you decrease the liquidity in the futures market , you increase the discrepancies between stocks and futures , '' said Christopher Pedersen , director of trading at Twenty-First Securities Corp .
Opponents of index arbitrage trading do n't lose much sleep over the prospect of futures speculators being driven out of the market .
They argue that raising the cost of trading stock-index futures would eventually choke off price-jarring arbitrage trades between stocks and futures and increase the stability of stock prices .
`` You would diminish the impact of stock-index arbitrage enormously if you change the margin requirements for futures , '' said Richard Cantor , chief investment officer for Neuberger & Berman , which manages $ 17.5 billion in client funds .
Mr. Cantor said that it was difficult to quantify the impact of stock index arbitrage on the performance of Neuberger & Berman -- whose tax-exempt accounts are lagging broad market averages so far this year -- or of other institutional investors .
But he echoed the complaints of other money managers in claiming that stock-index arbitrage has tended to `` commoditize securities , shifting from a focus on earnings and assets to a trading focus .
Raising stock-index futures margins sharply could curtail the volume of index arbitrage trading by the handful of Wall Street securities firms
that dominate the business .
But these firms , many of whom say they have already quit doing index arbitrage trades for their own accounts , are especially resourceful when it comes to taking advantage of profitable opportunities .
A few firms , while claiming not to trade for their own accounts , are effectively doing just that in the guise of executing customer orders , then quietly splitting the profits with their customers , futures traders say .
Tax-exempt institutional investors do n't trade on margin , and therefore would n't be affected by an increase in stock-index futures margins .
Raising stock-index futures margins sharply would n't have much of an effect on S&P 500 futures traders known as locals .
They often trade opposite brokerage firms , but as long as they do n't carry positions overnight , they effectively trade without putting any money down .
Futures industry officials here -- who fear the program-trading debate might turn into an attack on the futures markets themselves -- raise the specter of foreign competition when they argue against the kinds of changes critics are proposing .
`` If futures margins are raised substantially , some other country will allow lower margins , and that 's where the business will go , '' said Barry Lind , chairman of Lind-Waldock & Co. , a futures broker .
WEIRTON STEEL Corp. said it completed a $ 300 million sale of 10-year notes , the final step in the 1984 buy-out of the company from National Steel Corp .
The 10 7\/8 % notes were priced at 99.5 % to yield 10.958 % in an offering managed by Bear , Stearns & Co. , Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. and Lazard Freres & Co. , the company said .

CONFRONTATIONS LOOM between Bush and Democrats in Congress .
The early bipartisanship dissipates as issues become more contentious and the Democrats find their voice .
They begin to blame Bush 's insistence on a capital-gains cut for the disarray in the budget process ; one White House aide sees a `` train wreck '' coming .
The Democrats also increasingly lash Bush for timidity on Eastern Europe .
White House advisers formally threaten vetoes of the foreign-aid and child-care bills and informally discuss a possible veto of the defense bill .
Child care could be an especially tough fight ; after Bush 's veto of abortion funding for rape and incest victims , anti-abortion lawmakers feel extra pressure to show attention to women 's concerns .
Bush still tries a personal touch ; he
golfs with Ways and Means Chairman Rostenkowski and meets privately with Senate Democrats .
A `` MUST-SIGN '' BILL becomes a magnet for controversial proposals .
To avoid missing Social Security payments , the government must get a raise in its borrowing limit by Nov. 8 ; the necessity of the measure attracts numerous attempts at adding unrelated measures to it .
Republicans will try to offer the capital-gains cut in the Senate ; the Democrats probably have the votes to block it , though some fear brinksmanship on the bill .
Other likely candidates for riders include revision of the Gramm-Rudman law , repeal of catastrophic-illness insurance , child care and other measures
that were stripped off the recent budget-reconciliation bill .
Democratic leaders will try to keep them off , fearing that allowing any of them would weaken their argument against capital gains .
BUSH TURNS
the failed Panama coup to his advantage , at least for now .
His complaints about secret restrictions on anti-Noriega plots put Congress on the defensive , even though the curbs did n't play a role in the coup 's collapse .
Senate intelligence chiefs Boren and Cohen agree with the White House to loosen the rules ; CIA agents stand to gain broad leeway to work with rebels , even if a coup might endanger Noriega 's life .
The next step : a new covert plan for unseating the dictator .
One possibility is more active American recruitment of rebels
who would agree to hand Noriega to the U.S. and install the elected leaders
he rebuffed .
The last coup plotters refused to do either .
But Bush 's handling of the previous attempt hobbles future efforts .
Noriega has purged potential enemies , and doubts grow about U.S. resolve .

General Electric Co. executives and lawyers provided `` misleading and false '' information to the Pentagon in 1985 in an effort to cover up `` longstanding fraudulent '' billing practices , federal prosecutors alleged in legal briefs .
The government 's startling allegations , filed only days before the scheduled start of a criminal overcharge trial against GE in Philadelphia federal district court , challenge the motives and veracity of the nation 's third-largest defense contractor .
In a strongly worded response summarizing a filing made in the same court yesterday , GE asserted that `` prosecutors have misstated the testimony of witnesses , distorted documents and ignored important facts .
'' The company attacked the government 's allegations as `` reckless and baseless mudslinging , '' and said its management `` promptly and accurately reported '' to the Pentagon
all relevant information about billing practices .
The case strikes at the corporate image of GE , which provides the military with everything from jet engines and electronic warfare equipment to highly classified design work on the Strategic Defense Initiative , and could cause a loss of future defense contracts if Pentagon and Justice Department officials take a tough stance .
The company has been considered an industry leader in advocating cooperation and voluntary disclosures of improper or inflated billing practices .
But the government now claims that a group of company managers and lawyers engaged in an elaborate strategy over five years to obscure from federal authorities
the extent and details of `` widespread '' fraudulent billing practices .
The problems were uncovered during a series of internal investigations of the company 's Space Systems division , which has been the focus of two separate overcharge prosecutions by the government since 1985 .
The dispute stems from pretrial maneuvering in the pending court case , in which prosecutors have been demanding access to a host of internal company memos , reports and documents .
Last November , a federal grand jury indicted GE on charges of fraud and false claims in connection with an alleged scheme to defraud the Army of $ 21 million on a logistics computer contract .
The company , for its part , maintains that many of the disputed documents are privileged attorney-client communications
that should n't be turned over to prosecutors .
A hearing is scheduled on the issue today .
The government 's 136-page filing covers events leading up to the current case and an earlier indictment in March 1985 , when GE was accused of defrauding the Pentagon by illegally claiming cost overruns on Minuteman missile contracts .
GE pleaded guilty and paid a fine of more than $ 1 million in the Minuteman case , which involved some of the same individuals and operations
that are at the center of the dispute in the Philadelphia court .
In order to show that all of its units had corrected billing problems and therefore should become eligible again for new contracts , prosecutors contend that `` high-level GE executives '' and company lawyers provided `` misleading statements '' to then-Air Force Secretary Verne Orr and other Pentagon officials during a series of meetings in 1985 .
Overall , the government contends that GE 's disclosure efforts largely were intended to `` curry favor '' with Pentagon officials without detailing the extent of the management lapses and allegedly pervasive billing irregularities uncovered by company investigations .
Prosecutors depict a company
that allegedly sat on damaging evidence of overcharges from 1983 to 1985 , despite warnings from an internal auditor .
When GE finally disclosed the problems , prosecutors contend that Mr. Orr `` was erroneously informed that the { suspected } practices had only just been discovered '' by GE management .
In its brief , the government asserted that it needs the internal GE documents to rebut anticipated efforts by GE during the trial to demonstrate `` its good corporate character .
GE , which was surprised by the last-minute subpoena for more than 100 boxes and file cabinets of documents , countered that senior GE managers did n't find out about questionable billing practices until 1985 , and that the information was passed on quickly to Mr. Orr at his first meeting with company representatives .
Subsequent meetings , initiated after the company and two of its units were briefly suspended from federal contracts , were held to familiarize Mr. Orr with the company 's self-policing procedures and to disclose additional information , according to GE .
GE 's filing contends that the billing practices at the heart of the current controversy involved technical disputes rather than criminal activity .
The company 's conduct `` does not even raise a question of wrongful corporate intent , ratification or cover-up , '' GE 's brief asserts .
`` On the contrary , it shows a corporation reacting swiftly and aggressively to very difficult issues in largely uncharted waters .
Mr. Orr could n't be reached for comment yesterday .
Weirton Steel Corp. said it reached a tentative agreement on a 48-month labor contract with the Independent Steelworkers Union covering production and maintenance employees .

an hour retroactive to Sept. 25 , 1989 , and for increases of 19 cents , 70 cents and 35 cents
an hour effective Jan. 1 , 1991 , 1992 and 1993 , respectively .

Georgia-Pacific Corp. 's unsolicited $ 3.19 billion bid for Great Northern Nekoosa Corp. was hailed by Wall Street despite a cool reception by the target company .
William R. Laidig , Nekoosa 's chairman , chief executive officer and president , characterized the $ 58-a-share bid as `` uninvited '' and said Nekoosa 's board would consider the offer `` in due course .
T. Marshall Hahn Jr. , Georgia-Pacific 's chairman and chief executive , said in an interview that all terms of the offer are negotiable .
He added that he had spoken with Mr. Laidig , whom
he referred to as a friend , by telephone Monday evening .
`` I 'm hopeful that we 'll have further discussions , '' Mr. Hahn said .
On Wall Street , takeover stock traders bid Nekoosa 's stock well above the Georgia-Pacific bid , assuming that Nekoosa 's will either be sold to a rival bidder or to Georgia-Pacific at a higher price -- as much as $ 75
a share , according to some estimates .
Yesterday , Nekoosa common closed in composite New York Stock Exchange trading at $ 62.875 , up $ 20.125 , on volume of almost 6.3 million shares .
Georgia-Pacific closed down $ 2.50 , at $ 50.875 in Big Board trading .
Takeover stock traders noted that with the junk-bond market in disarray , Georgia-Pacific 's bid is an indication of where the takeover game is headed : namely , industrial companies can continue bidding for one another , but financial buyers such as leveraged buy-out firms will be at a disadvantage in obtaining financing .
`` The way
the world is shaping up , the strategic buyer is going to be the rule and the financial buyer is going to be the exception , '' said one trader .
For the paper industry specifically , most analysts said the deal will spur a wave of paper-company takeovers , possibly involving such companies as Union Camp Corp. , Federal Paperboard Co. and Mead Corp .
The analysts argued that Georgia-Pacific 's offer , the first hostile bid ever among major players in the paper industry , ends the unwritten taboo on hostile bids , and will push managements to look closely at the industry 's several attractive takeover candidates .
`` Consolidation has been long overdue .
It was just the culture of the industry
that kept it from happening .
The Georgia-Pacific offer has definitely changed the landscape , '' said Gary Palmero of Oppenheimer & Co .
Added Mark Rogers of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. : `` It 's much easier to be second .
A Georgia-Pacific acquisition of Nekoosa would create the largest U.S. forest-products company .
Based on 1988 sales , Georgia-Pacific ranked third at $ 9.51 billion , behind Weyerhaeuser Co. at $ 10 billion and International Paper Co. at $ 9.53 billion .
Nekoosa ranked 11th with sales of $ 3.59 billion .
The combined company would have had 1988 sales of $ 13.1 billion .
But such a combination also presents great risks .
At a time when most analysts and industry consultants say pulp and paper prices are heading for a dive , adding capacity and debt could squeeze Georgia-Pacific if the industry declines more than the company expects .
Moreover , any unexpected strengthening of the dollar would hurt Georgia-Pacific because two of Nekoosa 's major product lines -- containerboard , which is used to make shipping boxes , and market pulp -- are exported in large quantities .
`` Nobody knows how deep the cycle is going to be , '' said Rod Young , vice president of Resource Information Systems Inc. , a Bedford , Mass. , economic-forecasting firm .
`` Depending on how far down you go , it may be difficult to pay off that debt .
One person familiar with Georgia-Pacific said the acquisition would more than double the company 's debt of almost $ 3 billion .
It also could be a drag on Georgia-Pacific earnings because the roughly $ 1.5 billion in goodwill -- the amount by which
the bid exceeds Nekoosa 's book value of $ 1.5 billion -- will have to be subtracted from earnings over a period of decades .
Georgia-Pacific 's Mr. Hahn said that a combined operation would allow savings in many ways .
The two companies
each produce market pulp , containerboard and white paper .
That means goods could be manufactured closer to customers , saving shipping costs , he said .
Moreover , production runs would be longer , cutting inefficiencies from adjusting machinery between production cycles .
And Georgia-Pacific could save money in selling pulp , because the company uses its own sales organization while Nekoosa employs higher-cost agents .
Mr. Hahn said Georgia-Pacific has accounted in its strategy for a `` significant downturn '' in the pulp and paper industry , an event that he said would temporarily dilute earnings .
But he said that even under those conditions , the company still would realize a savings of tens of millions of dollars in the first year following a merger .
`` The fit is so good , we see this as a time of opportunity , '' he said .
Georgia-Pacific , which has suspended its stock-repurchase program , would finance the acquisition with all bank debt , provided by banks led by BankAmerica Corp .
Georgia-Pacific owns 349,900 Nekoosa shares and would need federal antitrust clearance to buy more than $ 15 million worth .
U.S. clearance also is needed for the proposed acquisition .
For Nekoosa , defense options may be undercut somewhat by the precarious state of the junk-bond market , which limits how much value
the target could reach in a debt-financed recapitalization .
The company 's chairman , Mr. Laidig , and a group of advisers met at the offices of Wachtel Lipton Rosen & Katz , a law firm specializing in takeover defense .
Nekoosa also is being advised by Goldman , Sachs & Co .
Georgia-Pacific 's advisers are Wasserstein , Perella & Co. , which stands to receive a $ 15 million fee if the takeover succeeds , and the law firm of Shearman & Sterling .
People familiar with Nekoosa said its board is n't likely to meet before the week after next to respond to the bid .
The board has 10 business days to respond .
In addition to the usual array of defenses , including a so-called poison pill and a staggered board , Nekoosa has another takeover defense : a Maine state law barring hostile bidders from merging acquired businesses for five years .
Nekoosa is incorporated in Maine .
Georgia-Pacific has filed a lawsuit in federal court in Maine challenging the poison pill and the Maine merger law .
Nekoosa 's poison pill allows shareholders to vote to rescind it , but Georgia-Pacific is n't likely to pursue such a course immediately because that would take 90 to 120 days , and would n't affect the provisions of the Maine law .
Among companies mentioned by analysts as possible counterbidders for Nekoosa are International Paper , Weyerhaeuser , Canadian Pacific Ltd. and MacMillan Bloedel Ltd .
`` I 'm sure everybody else is putting pencil to paper , '' said Kathryn McAuley , an analyst with First Manhattan Co .
International Paper and Weyerhaeuser declined to comment .
Canadian Pacific could n't be reached for comment , and MacMillan Bloedel said it has n't any plans to make a bid for Nekoosa .
Investors were quick to spot other potential takeover candidates , all of which have strong cash flows and low-cost operations .
Among paper company stocks
that rallied on the Big Board because of the offer were Union Camp , up $ 2.75 to $ 37.75 , Federal Paperboard , up $ 1.75 to $ 27.875 , Mead , up $ 2.375 to $ 38.75 , and Temple Inland Inc. , up $ 3.75 to $ 62.25 .
In over-the-counter national trading , Bowater Inc. jumped $ 1.50 to $ 27.50 .
Some analysts argued that there wo n't be a flurry of takeovers because the industry 's continuing capacity-expansion program is eating up available cash .
Moreover , some analysts said they expect a foreign paper company with deeper pockets than Georgia-Pacific to end up acquiring Nekoosa , signaling to the rest of the industry that hostile bids are unproductive .
`` This is a one-time event , '' said Lawrence Ross of PaineWebber Inc. , referring to the Georgia-Pacific bid .
But many analysts believe that , given the attractiveness of paper companies ' cash flows , as well as the frantic consolidation of the paper industry in Europe , there will be at least a few more big hostile bids for U.S. companies within the next several months .
The buyers , these analysts added , could be either foreign or other U.S. concerns .
`` The Georgia-Pacific bid may open the door to a new era of consolidation '' in the paper industry , said Mark Devario of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc .
`` I do n't think anyone is now immune from takeover , '' said Robert Schneider of Duff & Phelps Inc. , Chicago .
He added : `` Every paper company management has to be saying to itself , ` Before someone comes after me , I 'm going to go after somebody .
Prudential-Bache 's Mr. Rodgers said he does n't see the industry 's capacity-expansion program hindering takeover activity .
Several projects , he said , are still on the drawing board .
Moreover , `` it 's a lot cheaper and quicker to buy a plant than to build one .
Indeed , a number of analysts said that Japanese paper companies are hungry to acquire additional manufacturing capacity anywhere in the world .
Some predicted that Nekoosa will end up being owned by a Japanese company .
Meanwhile , Shearson Lehman 's Mr. Devario said that , to stay competitive , the U.S. paper industry needs to catch up with the European industry .
Since the most-recent wave of friendly takeovers was completed in the U.S. in 1986 , there have been more than 100 mergers and acquisitions within the European paper industry , he said .

West Texas Intermediate , the U.S. benchmark crude , seemed tethered again yesterday in trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange .
Widely expected to open 10 to 15 cents
a barrel higher on the strength of statistics from the American Petroleum Institute , the December contract managed to start the session only eight cents higher .
In the last hour of the trading day , December contract took a tumble to end the session 10 cents lower at $ 19.62
a barrel .
And now that the price has fallen below $ 19.65 , which
many had said showed considerable resistance , some traders and analysts figure there 's little to stop the price from going lower on technical decisions .
With no petroleum-related news or changes in the fundamentals to dictate price moves , `` technicians are wanting to sell this stuff , '' said Eric Bolling of Edge Trading Corp .
`` And short-term , the technicians may have their way .
The market quickly discounted the weekly inventory report showing a 6.3 million barrel decrease in U.S. crude oil stocks as the legacy of Hurricane Jerry .
That storm hit the Gulf Coast Oct. 13 , closing the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port for a time and preventing tankers from unloading .
Next week 's report could very well show an increase in crude inventories .
Dismissing the trade group 's numbers left traders plenty of time to worry anew about the latest reports on OPEC production .
An AP-Dow Jones survey of integrated oil companies , independent refiners , and oil industry consultants indicates that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries increased its production to 22.2 million barrels
a day in September .
Estimates suggest October 's figure may be even higher .
That level of production is n't of much concern as long as demand continues strong , analysts said .
But the first quarter of the year is generally the weakest and OPEC production does n't seem to be slackening in anticipation of that .
Also , maintaining current demand assumes no significant slowdown in world economies .
To top off the bearish factors affecting yesterday 's trading , late October weather , especially in the Northeast U.S. , continues to be very moderate , leaving heating oil futures trading lackluster .
`` We are n't seeing any cold weather here , '' Mr. Bolling said from New York .
In other commodity markets yesterday :
GRAINS AND SOYBEANS : Soybean and corn futures prices moved higher on the strength of buying from commodity pool managers trying to profit from technical price trends , as well as continued export strength .
A leveling off of farmer selling tied to the harvest also removed some of the downward pressure on futures contract prices .
Wheat futures prices fell , however , at least partly in reaction to the rumored selling of futures contracts equal to several million bushels of wheat by commodity speculator Richard Dennis .
Neither Mr. Dennis nor officials of his Chicago trading company , C&D Commodities , could be reached for comment .
As for corn and soybean futures , `` a lot of commission house buying this morning and computer-driven buying '' supported prices in early trading , said Steven Freed , a futures analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago .
Soybean futures for November delivery gained 5.25 cents
a bushel to close at $ 5.66
a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade .
December corn futures added 2.25 cents
a bushel to close at $ 2.4225
a bushel on the Board of Trade .
Announced and anticipated purchases from foreign countries are also supporting futures prices .
`` Russian ships are arriving in the gulf and there is n't enough grain in the pipeline , '' said Katharina Zimmer , a futures analyst with Merrill Lynch & Co. in New York .
The Soviet Union has purchased roughly eight million tons of grain
this month , and is expected to take delivery by year end , analysts said .
COTTON : Futures prices rose modestly , but trading volume was n't very heavy .
The December contract settled at 73.97 cents
a pound , up 0.59 cent , but it rose as high as 74.20 cents .
Several cotton analysts said that the move appeared to be mostly technical .
Traders
who had sold contracts earlier , in hopes of buying them back at lower prices , yesterday were buying contracts back at higher prices to limit their losses .
Floor traders also said that the market could have been helped by rumors , which have been circulating for the past two days , about China purchasing cotton .
The rumor , which has been neither confirmed nor denied , has China buying 125,000 to 200,000 bales for near-term delivery .
One floor trader said that if there were Chinese purchases , they should have had a bigger effect on the market .
Another said that if China was a buyer , it would be the earliest that country had made purchases since the 1979-80 crop year , and thus would be a bullish sign .
This trader characterized the recent price action as a contest between the fundamentalists , who see higher prices ahead , and the technicians , who are basically buying cotton toward the bottom of the current trading range , around 71 cents , and selling it when the price climbs more than 74 cents .
This trader said that he thought the market would turn aggressively bullish from a technical standpoint if the December contract was able to exceed 75.75 cents .
He also noted that stocks on Aug. 1 , 1990 , are currently projected at 3.3 million bales , the smallest end-of-season supply since 1985 .
COCOA : The modest sell-off , which started on Tuesday , continued .
The December contract ended at $ 999
a metric ton , down $ 15 .
The market is drifting , at least partly , because of a lack of crop information out of Ghana and the Ivory Coast , the two largest African producers .
Harry Schwartz , a soft commodity specialist for Cargill Investors Services in New York , said the only report Ghana has issued about the arrival of cocoa from the interior was for 7,839 metric tons as of Oct. 12 .
By this time last year , he noted , arrivals totaling 33,270 tons had been announced .
A similar situation apparently exists in the Ivory Coast with no figures released yet this year , compared with 55,000 tons as of this time
a year ago .
He said that if little cocoa actually has arrived at the ports , shipping delays could result .
This is the worry
that probably brought steadiness to the market earlier in the week , he said .
There was also some fear that without Ivory Coast cocoa
a large French cocoa merchant , Cie .
Financiere Sucre et Denrees , might not be able to deliver cocoa against the contracts
it had sold earlier for December delivery in London .
However , the French merchant has about 200,000 tons of old crop Ivory Coast cocoa stored in the Netherlands from an agreement
it had negotiated with the Ivory Coast last spring .
Cargill thinks that even though the merchant has a contract stating that it wo n't bring this cocoa to market until after March 1991 , there is some evidence
the contract has been modified .
This modification , apparently , would permit the French merchant to deliver this cocoa , if necessary , against existing short positions .
Your Oct. 6 editorial `` The Ill Homeless '' referred to research by us and six of our colleagues
that was reported in the Sept. 8 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association .
Your comments implied we had discovered that the `` principal cause '' of homelessness is to be found in the large numbers of mentally ill and substance-abusing people in the homeless population .
We have made no such statement .
It is clear that most mentally ill people and most alcoholics do not become homeless .
The `` causes '' of homelessness are poorly understood and complex in any individual case .
In quoting from our research
you emphasized the high prevalance of mental illness and alcoholism .
You did not note that the homeless people we examined had a multitude of physical disorders in addition to their psychiatric problems and substance abuse .
They suffered from malnutrition , chest diseases , cardiovascular disorders , skin problems , infectious diseases and the aftereffects of assaults and rape .
Homeless people not only lack safety , privacy and shelter , they also lack the elementary necessities of nutrition , cleanliness and basic health care .
In a recent report , the Institute of Medicine pointed out that certain health problems may predispose a person to homelessness , others may be a consequence of it , and a third category is composed of disorders whose treatment is difficult or impossible if a person lacks adequate shelter .
The interactions between health and homelessness are complex , defying sweeping generalizations as to `` cause '' or `` effect .
If we look to the future , preventing homelessness is an important objective .
This will require us to develop a much
more sophisticated understanding of the dynamics of homelessness than we currently possess , an understanding

A study by Tulane Prof. James Wright says homelessness is due to a complex array of problems , with the common thread of poverty .
The study shows that nearly 40 % of the homeless population is made up of women and children and that only 25 % of the homeless exhibits
some combination of drug , alcohol and mental problems .
According to Dr. Wright , homelessness is `` simultaneously a housing problem , an employment problem , a demographic problem , a problem of social disaffiliation , a mental health problem , a family violence problem , a problem created by the cutbacks in social welfare spending , a problem resulting from the decay of the traditional nuclear family , and a problem intimately connected to the recent increase in the number of persons living below the poverty level .

To quote the highly regarded director of a privately funded drop-in center for the homeless in New York : `` If you 're homeless , you do n't sleep for fear of being robbed or murdered .
After your first three weeks of sleep deprivation , you 're scarcely in touch with reality
any more ; without psychiatric treatment , you may well be unable to fend for yourself ever again .
Some of the homeless , obviously , had pre-existing mental illness or addiction .
But many others have fallen through cracks in the economy into the grim , brutal world of our city streets .
Once there , what ways of escape are open to them other than drink , drugs or insanity ?

You dismiss as `` sentimental '' the view that the reduction of federal housing-assistance programs by 77 % might have played a significant role in the increased number of men and women sleeping on our city streets during the Reagan-Bush years .
There is no sign that you bothered to consider the inverse of your logic : namely , that mental illness and substance abuse might be to some degree consequences rather than causes of homelessness .
Your research stopped when a convenient assertion could be made .

Of the approximately 200 sponsors of the recent march in Washington for the homeless , you chose to cite such groups as the National Association of Home Builders and the International Union of Bricklayers and Allied Craftsmen , insinuating that the march got its major support from self-serving groups that `` know a good thing when they see it , '' and that the crusade was based on greed or the profit motive .
But is n't the desire for profit
the driving force behind those
who subscribe to , and advertise in , your paper ?
Why did n't you mention the YMCA or the YWCA or Catholic Charities USA or a hundred other nonprofit organizations
that participated in the march ?
As for the findings on the 203 Baltimore homeless
who underwent psychiatric examinations , I suggest you conduct your own survey .
Choose 203 business executives , including , perhaps , someone from your own staff , and put them out on the streets , to be deprived for one month of their homes , families and income .
I would predict that within a short time most of them would find Thunderbird
a satisfactory substitute for Chivas Regal and that their `` normal '' phobias , anxieties , depressions and substance abuse would increase dramatically .

Well , the arrogant East Coast media have spoken again ( `` Going for the Green , '' editorial , Oct. 17 ) .
Having resided in the great state of California for the past seven years , I find it hard to ignore our environmental problems when I start my commute to work with eyes tearing and head aching from the polluted air ; when I try to enjoy the beaches and come home covered with tar and oil ; when I hear of numerous deaths related to irresponsible processing of cheese and use of chemicals in fruit growing .
Perhaps it 's entertaining for those like you to discount the concerns of environmentalists , suggesting that their save-the-earth initiatives are `` whacky '' and referring to so many citizens as `` la-la activists .
'' Strange that we do n't hear similar criticisms of the East Coast activists
who seek to clean up Boston Harbor or rid their beaches of medical waste .
While there are no easy low-cost solutions , simply ignoring our problems will result in their severity increasing and spreading throughout the state , the nation and the world .
If nothing else , such initiatives as these will provide an awareness to citizens and lawmakers and encourage appropriate corrective action .
Before your next California-bashing editorial , please spend more time out here witnessing the situation -- it just may change your view .

I realize you were just looking for something snotty to say about California and its environmental movement , but picking Frank Lloyd Wright to say it for you was a bad call .
Wright 's organic architecture demonstrated a keen sensitivity to the environment decades before it became fashionable among `` la-la activists .
'' Indeed , Wright said all his life that the greatest lessons
he learned were derived from the study of nature .
Obviously , it 's lost on you that about 75 % of the American people these days ( and in fact
the president of the United States ) consider themselves
environmentalists .
As for California being a state run by liberal environmental loonies , let 's not forget where Ronald Reagan came from .
Perhaps Mr. Reagan , who claimed that air pollution is caused by trees , is the man
you should be quoting to back up your position that economics is more important than the Earth .
But it was Frank Lloyd Wright
who said , `` Is this not Anti-Christ ?
The Moloch
that knows no God but more ?

Your editorial was commendable and neatly matched by the readers ' comments in letters to the editor , `` Alar : Scaring on the Side of Caution .
'' The illogic and inaccuracy of John H. Adams 's comments for the National Resources Defense Council fully justifies your characterization of California 's Greens in particular as `` la-la activists .
'' We may all hope that California 's voters will heed the scientific realities that their own university 's renowned Prof. Tom Jukes provides them and ignore the charlatanry profferred by their `` wealthy Hollywood weepers .
I have a different approach to offer , not only to Californians , but to all Americans .
In a free country , the law should restrict citizens as little as is consistent with good manners and public safety .
Would-be naysayers should have the burden of proving reasonable necessity when they urge a prohibition for enactment into law .

The 170 airlines in the International Air Transport Association last year posted group net profit of $ 2.5 billion on revenue of $ 125.1 billion .
According to the association 's annual report , scheduled to be released today in Warsaw , IATA members have n't posted such a strong performance since the late 1970s .
Revenue last year increased by more than 11 % over 1988 , and net income nearly tripled from restated year-earlier net of $ 900 million .
The group attributed the strong results to the favorable economic climate , rising demand for air travel and improved average yield ( revenue received per ton of traffic transported a kilometer ) .
Systemwide , IATA airlines carried 632 million passengers last year , 2 % more than in 1987 .
But passenger-kilometers , the distance flown while carrying people , increased 5.3 % in 1988 .
The association said that lack of airport and air space capacity is the biggest problem facing the airline industry .
The KGB has abolished a unit known for persecuting dissidents , the government newspaper Izvestia said .
The newspaper quoted KGB chairman Vladimir A. Kryuchkov as saying the definition of anti-Soviet crimes had narrowed , the laws had changed and people no longer have to fear a simple slip of the tongue .
Mr. Kryuchkov was quoted as saying that in place of the infamous 5th Directorate
a new unit would work `` to foil the conspiracies of foreign intelligence services to create and use organized anti-government groups in our country .
Czechoslovakia has restricted consumer-goods exports to neighbor countries because of `` massive buying out of food '' by tourists from Poland , Hungary and the Soviet Union , the Rude Pravo daily said .
Rising inflation in Poland and Hungary makes Czechoslovak food , clothing and shoes relatively cheap for visitors from these countries .
The paper gave no details of what
the restrictions would entail but said the measures were necessary to protect the domestic market .
West Germany 's biggest union , IG Metall , said it is ready to back demands for more pay and shorter hours with strikes against the nation 's automotive , steel and engineering industries .
Its chairman told the union to prepare for the worst in next year 's confrontation with employers over a new three-year wage deal .
A major goal is to cut the working week to 35 hours from the present 37 .
Last week came news of alarm in Venice over a plan to tap gas fields off the city 's coast .
Now comes word from a scientist that over the next century Venice will sink nearly three times faster than the present rate because of the `` greenhouse effect .
'' `` Global warming means higher tides
which will lower Venice by another 23 inches in the next 100 years , '' Giovanni Cecconi of the
the New Venice Consortium said .
The consortium of scientists and companies was set up by Italy to help preserve the fabled city of canals .
Venice has sunk 10 inches in this century .
West Germany 's Quelle said it will establish a mail-order operation with two local partners in the Soviet Union next year .
Saying this is a first for a Western company , West Germany 's largest mail-order group said the newly established Moscow-based Intermoda company is scheduled to begin operations in February 1990 .
Intermoda will initially only send the textile and clothing section of the Quelle catalog , translated into Russian , to Soviet customers
who have access to convertible currency .
The European Community Commission has imposed provisional anti-dumping duties on imports of South Korean small-screen color-television sets .
Saying that a surge in low-priced imports had damaged EC producers ' profits and led to job losses , the commission imposed a duty of 10.2 % on TVs made by Daewoo , a duty of 12.3 % on Goldstar Co. , 13 % on Samsung and 19.6 % on TVs made by other South Korean producers .
The commission said that EC television producers lost `` important market shares '' and suffered an `` unsustainable '' pressure on prices because of the Korean companies ' marketing and pricing policies , which
it said were `` in clear violation '' of international trade rules .
In other news concerning South Korea 's television industry , Samsung signed an agreement with Soyuz , the external-trade organization of the Soviet Union , to swap Korean television sets and videocassette recorders for pig iron from the Soviet Union .
South Korea and the Soviet Union have no diplomatic relations but exchanged trade offices earlier this year .
Sri Lanka , where more than 15,000 people have died in six years of ethnic turmoil , said it will ban sex and violence from state-owned television next year .

H&R BLOCK Inc. had net income of $ 100.2 million , or $ 1.90

The figure was incorrectly shown as a net loss in a chart accompanying Friday 's Heard on the Street column .

The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was enacted to keep the promise of the Fifteenth Amendment and enable Southern blacks to go to the polls , unhindered by literacy tests and other exclusionary devices .
Twenty-five years later , the Voting Rights Act has been transformed by the courts and the Justice Department into a program of racial gerrymandering designed to increase the number of blacks and other minorities -- Hispanics , Asians and native Americans -- holding elective office .
In the 1980s , the Justice Department and lower federal courts
that enforce the Voting Rights Act have required state legislatures and municipal governments to create the maximum number of `` safe '' minority election districts -- districts where minorities form between 65 % and 80 % of the voting population .
The program has even been called upon to create `` safe '' white electoral districts in municipalities where whites are the minority .
Although Section 2 of the act expressly disclaims requiring that minorities win a proportional share of elective offices , few municipal and state government plans achieve preclearance by the Justice Department or survive the scrutiny of the lower federal courts unless they carve out as many solidly minority districts as possible .
The new goal of the Voting Rights Act -- more minorities in political office -- is laudable .
For the political process to work , all citizens , regardless of race , must feel represented .
One essential indicator that they are is that members of minority groups get elected to public office with reasonable frequency .
As is , blacks constitute 12 % of the population , but fewer than 2 % of elected leaders .
But racial gerrymandering is not the best way to accomplish that essential goal .
It is a quick fix for a complex problem .
Far from promoting a commonality of interests among black , white , Hispanic and other minority voters , drawing the district lines according to race suggests that race is the voter 's and the candidate 's most important trait .
Such a policy implies that only a black politician can speak for a black person , and that only a white politician can govern on behalf of a white one .
Examples of the divisive effects of racial gerrymandering can be seen in two cities -- New York and Birmingham , Ala .
When they
reapportion their districts after the 1990 census , every other municipality and state in the country will face this issue .
New York City : Racial gerrymandering has been a familiar policy in New York City since 1970 , when Congress first amended the Voting Rights Act to expand its reach beyond the Southern states .
In 1972 , the Justice Department required that the electoral map in the borough of Brooklyn be redrawn to concentrate black and Hispanic votes , despite protests that the new electoral boundaries would split a neighborhood of Hasidic Jews into two different districts .
This year , a commission appointed by the mayor to revise New York 's system of government completed a new charter , expanding the City Council to 51 from 35 members .
Sometime in 1991 , as soon as the 1990 census becomes available , a redistricting panel will redraw the City Council district lines .
The Charter Revision Commission has made it clear that in response to the expectations of the Justice Department and the commission 's own commitment to enhancing minority political leadership , the new district lines will be drawn to maximize the number of solidly minority districts .
Blacks and Hispanics currently make up 38 % of the city 's population and hold only 25 % of the seats on the council .
Several of the city 's black leaders , including Democratic mayoral nominee David Dinkins , have spoken out for racial gerrymandering to accord blacks and Hispanics `` the fullest opportunity for representation .
In this connection , it is important to note that several members of New York 's sitting City Council represent heterogeneous districts
that bring together sizable black , Hispanic , and non-Hispanic white populations -- Carolyn Maloney 's 8th district in northern Manhattan and the south Bronx and Susan Alter 's 25th district in Brooklyn , for example .
To win their seats on the council , these political leaders have had to listen to all the voices in their district and devise public policies
that would benefit all .
Often they have found that the relevant issue is not race , but rather housing , crime prevention or education .
Birmingham , Ala. : The unusual situation in Birmingham vividly illustrates the divisive consequences of carving out safe districts for racial minorities .
In Birmingham , which is 57 % black , whites are the minority .
Insisting that they are protected by the Voting Rights Act , a group of whites brought a federal suit in 1987 to demand that the city abandon at-large voting for the nine member City Council and create nine electoral districts , including four safe white districts .
The white group argued that whites were not fully and fairly represented , because in city-wide elections only black candidates or white candidates
who catered to `` black interests '' could win .
No federal court has ruled that the Voting Rights Act protects a white minority , but in June
the Justice Department approved a districting plan for Birmingham
that carves out three white-majority districts and six black-majority districts .
Richard Arrington , Birmingham 's black mayor , lamented the consequences .
`` In the past , people
who had to run for office had to moderate their views because they could n't afford to offend blacks or whites , '' he said .
`` Now you go to districts , you 're likely to get candidates whose views are more extreme , white and black , on racial issues .
'' Two hundred years ago , critics of the new United States Constitution warned that the electoral districts for Congress were too large and encompassed too many different economic interests .
A small farmer and a seaport merchant could not be represented by the same spokesman , they said .
But James Madison refuted that argument in one of the most celebrated political treatises ever written , No. 10 of the Federalist Papers .
Madison explained that a representative 's duty was to speak not for the narrow interests of one group but instead for the common good .
Large , heterogeneous election districts would encourage good government , said Madison , because a representative would be compelled to serve the interests of all his constituents and be servile to none .
Madison 's noble and unifying vision of the representative still can guide us .
As long as we believe that all Americans , of every race and ethnic background , have common interests and can live together cooperatively , our political map should reflect our belief .
Racial gerrymandering -- creating separate black and white districts -- says that we have discarded that belief in our ability to live together and govern ourselves as one people .

Copperweld Corp. , a specialty steelmaker , said 445 workers at a plant in Shelby , Ohio , began a strike after the United Steelworkers Local 3057 rejected a new contract on Tuesday .
The previous contract between Copperweld 's Ohio Steel Tube division and the union expired at midnight Tuesday .
The union vote to reject the proposed pact was 230-215 .
Copperweld said it does n't expect a protracted strike .
It said it has taken measures to continue shipments during the work stoppage .
Dell Computer Corp. said it cut prices on several of its personal computer lines by 5 % to 17 % .
The Austin , Texas-based company , which specializes in the direct sale of personal computers and accessories , said its price cuts include a $ 100 reduction on its System 210 computer with 512 kilobytes of memory , a 40-megabyte hard disk and a color monitor .
That package now sells for about $ 2,099 .
A computer using the more-advanced Intel Corp. 386 microprocessor , with four megabytes of memory and a 100-megabyte hard disk now sells for $ 5,699 , down from $ 6,799 .
Personal computer prices for models using the Intel 286 and 386 microprocessors , which
the Dell models use , generally have been coming down as chip prices have fallen .
Retailers in the West and parts of the South are entering the critical Christmas shopping season with more momentum than those in other regions .
In a new report , the International Council of Shopping Centers said sales of general merchandise in the West for the first seven months of 1989 rose 6.6 % above year-earlier levels .
Sales increased a more modest 4.8 % in the South and 4.4 % in the Midwest .
But sales in the oil-patch state of Texas surged 12.9 % and sales in South Carolina jumped 10.6 % in the period , the New York trade group said .
In the Northeast , however , sales declined 0.4 % in the period , with sales in New England falling 2.6 % .
The numbers show that `` we do n't have a monolithic economy , '' said Isaac Lagnado , council research director .
`` There are a lot of have and have-not markets .
Sales nationally rose 3.9 % through July , the latest month for which
the figures are available , the council said .
The Northern California earthquake and Hurricane Hugo are likely to temporarily damp sales growth in the West and South Carolina .
But Mr. Lagnado predicted the regional trends would continue through Christmas .
`` The big mo is as much of a factor in retailing as in politics , '' he said .
The Christmas quarter is important to retailers because it represents roughly a third of their sales and nearly half of their profits .
The council 's report is based on data
the trade group buys from the U.S. Census Bureau .
The information on 125 metropolitan markets is supplied by retailers such as Sears , Roebuck & Co. and K mart Corp. as well as closely held concerns such as R.H. Macy & Co .
The council plans to release its regional reports monthly .
Mr. Lagnado said strength in employment appears to have the biggest impact on sales growth .
El Paso , Austin and Fort Worth , the three strongest retail markets in the nation , are all located in Texas , where employment grew a relatively strong 2 % .
Massachusetts , which has lost jobs in the computer and defense-related industries , was the weakest link in bleak New England .
The results reflect a reversal in the fortunes of the regions during the past two years .
In 1987 , the West had the slowest sales growth , and the South and the Midwest were first and second respectively , according to the council .
Mr. Lagnado said that although retailers probably wo n't ever recover sales lost because of the California quake and Hurricane Hugo , they could see some benefits later on .
Stores such as Sears
that sell big-ticket durable goods might actually get a boost as consumers rush to replace items lost in the disasters , he said .
Pacific First Financial Corp. said shareholders approved its acquisition by Royal Trustco Ltd. of Toronto for $ 27
a share , or $ 212 million .
The thrift holding company said it expects to obtain regulatory approval and complete the transaction by year-end .
Vitro S.A. of Monterrey , Mexico , said its THR Corp. subsidiary has entered into definitive loan agreements in connection with Vitro 's $ 21.25-a-share tender offer for Anchor Glass Container Corp .
The agreements are with Security Pacific National Bank and an affiliate of Donaldson , Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp .
Proceeds of the loan agreement , together with funds from Vitro , will permit the purchase of all shares outstanding of Anchor and the payment of all related costs and expenses .
Vitro said the definitive agreements require that Anchor obtain a waiver from its bank lenders of existing covenant defaults under its bank facilities .
Since Anchor is still seeking this waiver , Vitro said the tender offer is being extended until 5 p.m. EST tomorrow .
David Evans , who
last week resigned as president and chief executive of Qintex Entertainment Inc. `` for personal reasons '' just as the company filed for bankruptcy-law protection , has been temporarily reappointed to both
positions , the company said .
Qintex Entertainment also said Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer Jonathan Lloyd , 37 years old , would join the nine-member board .
He succeeds Roger Kimmel , who resigned last week saying his participation in evaluating the company 's role in buying MGM\/UA Communications Co. was no longer necessary .
Mr. Evans will stay until a successor is found , but not later than the end of the year , the company said .
It was the 49-year-old Mr. Evans
who had moved into the offices of MGM\/UA and run the company during Qintex Australia Ltd. 's aborted bid for the movie company .
After MGM\/UA terminated the $ 1.5 billion merger because of a dispute over a $ 50 million letter of credit , Qintex Entertainment -- which is 43%-owned by Qintex Australia -- found itself facing problems of its own .
And the relationship between Qintex Entertainment and the Australian company appears to be quickly deteriorating .
On Oct. 19 , Qintex Entertainment was about to default on a $ 5.9 million payment owed to MCA Inc. in connection with the distribution of a television program .
Qintex Entertainment was depending on Qintex Australia to arrange financing .
But early on Oct. 19 , the second of two hectic days of board meetings , Mr. Evans said he believed Qintex Australia would n't be forthcoming .
He recommended that the company file for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code before the MCA deadline , according to a source familiar with the sessions .
But a majority of the board , which includes three members from the Australian company , overrode him .
Mr. Evans resigned .
Later in the day , according to the source , the board reversed itself , decided to file for bankruptcy protection , and asked Mr. Evans to stay on .
Mr. Evans told the board
he needed the weekend to think about it .
Mr. Evans could n't be reached yesterday for comment .
Last Monday , Qintex Australia announced a restructuring plan and said it would sell off assets .
Last week
the company indicated it would cut back on the working capital
it would supply to Qintex Entertainment .
Separately , a Qintex Entertainment shareholder filed suit in federal court in Los Angeles charging Qintex Australia with misleading shareholders about Qintex Entertainment 's financial position .
Qintex Australia said it had n't seen the suit and could n't comment .

The world had a big yuk recently when the Soviets reported a rash of UFO landings , one of them bringing tall aliens
who glowed in the dark to Voronezh .
It is the opinion of Timothy Good , author of `` Above Top Secret : The World UFO Cover-Up '' ( Quill\/William Morrow , 592 pages , $ 12.95 ) , that the world laughs too fast .
Here is a bible for UFO watchers , complete with pictures of people
who say they 've had personal relationships with aliens .
One photo shows a woman sporting a scar
she says was made by a laser beam ( a low-caliber weapon , from the looks of the wound ) .
So far anyway , our alien visitors seem more intent on brightening our skies than pulverizing us .
Mr. Good devotes much serious space to the events of Feb. 25 , 1942 , when American gunners spotted strange lights in the sky above Los Angeles .
Air-raid sirens sounded the alarm at 2:25 a.m. , summoning 12,000 air wardens to duty .
Soon all hell broke loose .
Ground batteries , targeting an odd assortment of aircraft traveling at highly unusual speeds , opened up a furious fusillade .
The sky filled with 12.8-pound shells , several of which fell back to Earth , destroying homes and buildings .
When the smoke cleared , six people were dead ( three from heart attacks ) , and everyone wondered what in the world
they were shooting at .
Mr. Good , who documents these things as best he can , provides an official explanation in the form of a memorandum from Chief of Staff George C. Marshall to President Roosevelt : `` 1,430 pounds of ammunition , '' he wrote his commander in chief , were expended on `` unidentified aircraft , '' flying at speeds as slow as 200 mph and elevations between 9,000 and 18,000 feet .
Well , thousands of Californians on the scene insisted the ammo had been uselessly aimed at a large , hardy UFO , but you will just have to make your own decision about such sightings .
One thing 's for sure : There have been a ton of them , and greater beings than the editors of the National Enquirer have shown interest .
Gerald Ford , a fairly down-to-earth fellow , once sent a letter to the chairman of the Armed Services Committee recommending that `` there be a committee investigation of the UFO phenomenon .
I think we owe it to the American people to establish credibility regarding UFOs and to produce the greatest possible enlightenment on the subject .
Jimmy Carter went further in a 1976 campaign promise : `` If I become president , I 'll make every piece of information
this country has about UFO sightings available to the public , and the scientists .
I am convinced that UFOs exist because I have seen one ... .
But you know about campaign promises .
It still does n't look like governments are coughing up everything
they know .
Still , despite their efforts to convince the world that we are indeed alone , the visitors do seem to keep coming and , like the recent sightings , there 's often a detail or two
that suggests they may actually be a little on the dumb side .
For instance , witnesses in Voronezh say the pinheaded behemoths and their robot friend , after strolling around the city park , left behind some rocks .
Now why , you have to ask yourself , would intelligent beings haul a bunch of rocks around the universe ?
Or land in Russia so often .
In a 1961 incident , a Soviet mail plane disappeared off the radar screen just after radioing its position to ground control in Sverdlovsk .
A search party soon found the unscathed aircraft in a forest clearing much too small to have allowed a conventional landing .
What 's more , the seven mail personnel aboard were missing .
Again , you have to ask the obvious question : Why would intelligent beings kidnap seven Soviet mailmen ?
Speculation as to the nature of aliens will no doubt continue until we wake up one morning to find they 've taken over `` The Today Show , '' the way
they overwhelm an entire town in Jack Finney 's `` Invasion of the Body Snatchers '' ( Fireside\/Simon & Schuster , 216 pages , $ 8.95 ) .
Maybe some of our talk-show hosts and anchors have already been taken over ?
The point of this 1955 novel , which spawned two movies , is that the soulless pod people replicated by alien plants are virtually indistinguishable from human folks .
Another guy
who thinks they 're out there and closing fast is Whitley Strieber , whose new novel , `` Majestic '' ( Putnam , 317 pages , $ 18.95 ) , takes a look at a reported 1947 UFO crash near the Roswell Army Air Field in a New Mexico desert .
Mr. Strieber knows a lot about aliens .
He even had sex with one -- sort of , and not intentionally -- as readers learned in his `` Communion '' ( a book recently described in the New York Times as a `` nonfiction best seller '' ) .
The way Mr. Strieber tells it in his earnest prose , the intelligence officer
who found the craft 's strange debris was forced by the government to call the flower-inscribed scraps parts of a weather balloon .
The apparent crash became top secret , and the alien creatures went away upset with the rude ways of human beings .

Mr. Shiflett is an editorial writer for the Rocky Mountain News .
Lewis C. Veraldi , the father of the team
that created the highly successful Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable cars , retired early after experiencing recent heart problems .
Most recently , Mr. Veraldi , 59 years old , has been vice president of product and manufacturing engineering at Ford Motor Co .
But he is best known in the auto industry as the creator of a team car-development approach
that produced the two midsized cars
that were instrumental in helping the No. 2 auto maker record profits in recent years and in enabling the company 's Ford division to eclipse General Motors Corp. 's Chevrolet division as the top-selling nameplate in the U.S .
Under the so-called Team Taurus approach , Mr. Veraldi and other Ford product planners sought the involvement of parts suppliers , assembly-line workers , auto designers and financial staff members from the initial stages of the development cycle .
The concept 's goal was to eliminate bureaucracy and make Ford 's product development more responsive to consumer demands .
It was later applied to other new-car programs , including those
that produced the Ford Thunderbird and Mercury Cougar .
Ford Chairman Donald E. Petersen said yesterday that Mr. Veraldi has `` helped to change the world 's perception of American-made cars .
'' Mr. Veraldi worked at Ford for 40 years , holding a variety of car and parts-engineering positions .
Researchers at American Telephone & Telegraph Co. 's Bell Laboratories reported they raised the electrical current-carrying capacity of new superconductor crystals by a factor of 100 , moving the materials closer to commercial use .
The scientists said they created small changes in the crystal-lattice structures of the superconductors to raise the amount of current that single crystals could carry to 600,000 amps per square centimeter in a moderately strong magnetic field .
The scientists said they made the advance with yttrium-containing superconductors cooled to liquid-nitrogen temperature , or minus 321 degrees Fahrenheit .
Their report appears in today 's issue of the journal Nature .
The finding marks a significant step in research on `` bulk '' superconductors , which are aimed at use in wires for motors , magnets , generators and other applications .
Scientists had obtained even higher current-carrying capacity in thin films of the new superconductors , but have had problems increasing the amount of current that bulk crystals could carry .
Superconductors conduct electricity without resistance when cooled .
A family of ceramic superconductors discovered during the past three years promise new technologies such as cheaper electrical generation -- but only if their current-carrying capacity can be raised .
The AT&T advance shows how one aspect of the current-carrying problem can be overcome .
But `` it wo n't lead to imminent use '' of new superconductors , cautioned Robert B. van Dover , one of the AT&T researchers .
He added that the current-carrying capacity of multi-crystal samples of superconductors remains too low for most practical uses because of so-called weak links between crystals .
Such multi-crystal materials will probably be needed for commercial applications .
Mr. van Dover said the AT&T team created the desired crystal changes by bombarding superconductor samples with neutrons , a process
that creates some radioactivity in the samples and may not be feasible for large-scale commercial use .
Still , scientists breathed a collective sigh of relief about the finding , because it demonstrates how to overcome the `` flux pinning '' problem that earlier this year was widely publicized as undercutting new superconductors ' potential .
The problem involves the motion of small magnetic fields within superconductor crystals , limiting their current-carrying capacity .
Mr. van Dover said the crystal changes his team introduced apparently pins the magnetic fields in place , preventing them from lowering current-carrying capacity .
Mr. van Dover added that researchers are trying to determine precisely what crystal changes solved the problem .
Determining that may enable them to develop better ways to introduce the needed crystal-lattice patterns .
The AT&T team also is trying to combine their latest superconductor process with `` melt-textured growth , '' a process discovered earlier at Bell Laboratories .
The combined processes may significantly raise the current-carrying capacity of multi-crystal samples .
Costa Rica reached an agreement with its creditor banks
that is expected to cut that government 's $ 1.8 billion in bank debt by as much as 60 % .
The agreement was announced by Costa Rican President Oscar Arias Friday , as President Bush and other leaders from the Western Hemisphere gathered in the Central American nation for a celebration of democracy .
Costa Rica had been negotiating with the U.S. and other banks for three years , but the debt plan was rushed to completion in order to be announced at the meeting .
The government had fallen $ 300 million behind in interest payments .
Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady called the agreement `` an important step forward in the strengthened debt strategy , '' noting that it will `` when implemented , provide significant reduction in the level of debt and debt service owed by Costa Rica .
Under the plan , Costa Rica will buy back roughly 60 % of its bank debt outstanding at a deeply discounted price , according to officials involved in the agreement .
The remainder of the debt will be exchanged for new Costa Rican bonds with a 6 1\/4 % interest rate .
The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank are expected to provide approximately $ 180 million to help support the deal , and additional funds are expected from Japan .
Treasury officials say the Costa Rican agreement demonstrates that the Brady debt plan can benefit small debtor countries as well as big debtors , such as Mexico .
The House joined the Senate in making federal reparations for Japanese-Americans held in World War II internment camps a legal entitlement requiring the Treasury Department to meet expedited payments of an estimated $ 1.25 billion during the next several years .
The 249-166 roll call came as the chamber approved a compromise bill allocating $ 17.2 billion to the departments of State , Justice , and Commerce in fiscal 1990 and imposing increased fees on business interests making filings with the government .
An estimated $ 40 million would come annually from a new $ 20,000 charge on pre-merger notifications to the Justice Department , and Securities and Exchange Commission filing fees would rise by 25 % to fund
a $ 26 million increase in the agency 's budget .
Yesterday 's vote on Japanese-American reparations ensures final enactment of the entitlement provision , which abandons earlier efforts to find offsetting cuts but is seen as a more realistic path to expediting compensation first authorized in 1988 .
`` The only way to reduce the costs is to say we do n't want to pay the bill , '' said Rep. Neal Smith ( D. , Iowa ) , who taunted President Bush 's party to back up his campaign promise of supporting the claims of $ 20,000 per individual .
`` Read my lips , '' said Mr. Smith .
`` If you 're for paying the claims ... I do n't know how anyone can oppose this .
No payments would be made this year , but beginning in fiscal 1991 , the bill commits the government to annual payments of as much as $ 500 million until the total liability of $ 1.25 billion is met .
The issue has assumed some of the character of past civil-rights debates and reopens old regional divisions in the Democratic majority .
As much as Republicans led the opposition , among the 53 Democrats voting against treating the payments as an entitlement , 42 came from the 13 states in the Old Dixiecrat South and its borders .
The odd mix of departments in the underlying bill makes it
one of the more eclectic of the annual appropriations measures , and it is a lightning rod for a running battle over the fate of the Legal Services Corp .
The measure provides $ 321 million to maintain services but would sharply curb the power of the current board until successors are agreed to by the Bush administration .
The conservative bent of the incumbent appointees , named by former President Reagan , has divided Republicans .
And on back-to-back roll calls , 206-199 and 223-178 , the Appropriations Committee leadership turned back efforts to weaken or strip the proposed restrictions first added by Sen. Warren Rudman ( R. , N.H. )
The estimated $ 40 million from the new pre-merger notification fee would be divided between the Justice Department 's Antitrust Division and the Federal Trade Commission , which
both face serious cuts if the income is n't realized .
The Federal Bureau of Investigation is slated to receive $ 30 million by charging for fingerprint services in civil cases , and the judiciary will rely on another $ 32 million from bankruptcy charges , including a 33 % increase in the current filing fee .
The $ 17.2 billion total for the bill does n't include an estimated $ 1.2 billion in supplemental anti-drug funds approved by the House-Senate conference yesterday , and the rush of money is already provoking jealousy among states competing for assistance .
The House agreed to defer for a year
a scheduled 50 % increase in the required state matching funds for law-enforcement grants but , by a 287-123 margin , the chamber stripped a Senate initiative to raise the minimum grant for smaller states , such as New Hampshire and Delaware , to $ 1.6 million from $ 500,000 .
Few are more powerful in the competition for funds than the appropriations committees themselves -- including the three authors of the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings deficit-reduction law .
When a House-Senate conference on yesterday 's bill rescinded $ 11.8 million in unexpended funds for a Fort Worth , Texas , economic development project backed by former Speaker James Wright , Sen. Phil Gramm ( R. , Texas ) insisted last week that the money be preserved .
The measure includes $ 2 million secured by Mr. Rudman for a marine-research project at the University of New Hampshire , and Sen. Ernest Hollings ( D. , S.C .
) used his power to add $ 10 million for an advanced technology initiative in the Commerce Department .
This was in addition to a more parochial $ 4.5 million authorization for a health center in South Carolina upheld by a 273-121 vote in the House last night .
AEP INDUSTRIES Inc. directors authorized a 3-for-2 split of the common , payable Dec. 7 to stock of record Nov. 22 .
The split was aimed at boosting the stock 's liquidity , said Brendan Barba , chairman of the Moonachie , N.J. , maker of plastic film products .
After the split , the company will have more than 4.7 million shares outstanding .
In national over-the-counter trading yesterday , AEP shares closed at $ 21.25 , down 50 cents .
When Robert McDuffie was 14 , he got a chance to play in the starting lineup for his high school basketball team in Macon , Ga .
Unfortunately , his mother had tickets for a recital by Itzhak Perlman
the same night , and she was adamant about his attending .
`` I threw such a fit , '' says Mr. McDuffie , who had begun violin studies at the age of six .
`` But once Perlman started playing , I did n't give a damn about basketball ... .
Afterwards , I went home and practiced for three hours .
Today , it 's obvious that the brawny , six-foot , one-inch musician made the right choice .
At 31 , Mr. McDuffie has a rich , full-bodied tone , an admirable rhythmic precision and an increasingly busy schedule .
He 's currently in the midst of a 17-city U.S. tour with Yehudi Menuhin and the Warsaw Sinfonia , with stops including Charleston , S.C .
( Oct. 25 ) , Sarasota , Fla .
( Oct. 28 ) , Tampa , Fla .
( Oct. 29 ) and Miami ( Oct. 31 ) .
Later this season
he gives a recital at Washington 's Kennedy Center , and appears as soloist with several major orchestras .
Yet Mr. McDuffie 's career has developed at a slower pace than those of some of his better known contemporaries .
During the late 1970s , he was part of a musical `` brat pack '' -- a group of budding virtuosos
who studied at the Juilliard School with the noted pedagogue Dorothy DeLay .
His violin classmates included Shlomo Mintz , a protege of Isaac Stern
who performed with major orchestras while still a student ; Cho-Liang Lin , who joined the roster of ICM Artists Inc. at the age of 18 ; and Nadja Salerno-Sonnenberg , who launched her career by winning the 1981 Naumberg Competition .
`` I thought I was over the hill at 22 , '' recalls Mr. McDuffie , an outgoing man with pale blue eyes and a light Southern drawl .
`` But I was n't ready for a career at that time .
Young McDuffie 's first violin teacher was Henrik Schwarzenberger , a Hungarian refugee
who taught in the Macon public school system .
`` He taught me how to play like a gypsy , '' jokes the musician .
`` I did n't learn to count until I got to Juilliard .
'' After studies at that conservatory 's Pre-College Division with an assistant to the legendary instructor Ivan Galamian , he switched at the college level to Miss DeLay , Mr. Galamian 's longtime assistant and , ultimately , his rival .
`` I think I had to prove myself to her , '' says Mr. McDuffie .
`` But she was always encouraging .
She only put her foot down twice , '' he continues .
`` In my freshman year , my roommate was known as a party animal .
She thought I was n't getting my practicing done .
'' As the violinist tells it , his grandmotherly looking teacher `` put her hands on her hips , stomped her foot and said , ` You 've just got to get the { expletive deleted } out of there .
The second incident took place after Mr. McDuffie gave an ambitious student recital and was feeling rather pleased with himself .
Miss DeLay requested that he come to her studio with a tape of the recital .
`` We listened to the Chausson ` Poeme , ' '' he recalls , `` and she said , ` You hear the first note , that B-flat ?
That 's the only note
that 's truly in tune ...
' .
`` That 's the most important experience
I 've had with any teacher , '' he says , `` because she taught me how to listen .
Now , when I play with orchestras , the musicians often compliment me on my intonation .
It was also at Juilliard that Mr. McDuffie discovered his predilection for conservative , 20th-century American composers such as David Diamond and Samuel Barber .
After winning a school competition with a performance of the latter 's `` Violin Concerto , '' Mr. McDuffie was invited to play the work for the composer , who was dying of cancer .
`` Barber was seated by the fireplace looking very pale , '' recalls the violinist , who performed the work with a piano accompanist at the composer 's apartment .
`` He did n't say much , but what
he said was important because it 's not in the score .
There 's a beautiful , Coplandesque motif -- he 'd kill me if he heard me say that -- throughout the first movement ...
The only time
the violin has it is right at the end .
It 's written ` marcato ' in the score , and I played it
that way , kind of gigue-like .
And he yelled out ` dolce !
dolce !
' { ` sweet !
sweet !
' } .
`` So we did it over , '' he adds .
`` I played very transparently , with the tip of the bow .
If a conductor is sensitive enough to bring down the orchestra { volume } at that point , it makes the piece magical .
I do n't know why Barber never told anybody else .
On Isaac Stern 's recording
it 's very biting .
Since leaving Juilliard , Mr. McDuffie has made some smart moves and some controversial ones .
His guest appearance on the NBC soap opera `` Another World , '' scandalized musical elitists .
By contrast , he 's won kudos for his espousal of William Schuman 's `` Violin Concerto , '' which
he recently recorded for Angel\/EMI along with Leonard Bernstein 's engaging `` Serenade for Violin Solo , Strings and Percussion .
Mr. McDuffie 's sweet tone , heartfelt lyricism and rhythmic punch make him
an ideal interpreter of both
works .
Aided by the fluid playing of the St. Louis Symphony under Leonard Slatkin 's direction , this `` Serenade '' really swings .
Mr. Schuman 's `` Violin Concerto , '' which sounds more like a mildly atonal rhapsody for solo violin with orchestral accompaniment , meanders until the propulsive `` Agitato , fervente .
'' But there are ample rewards in its plaintive slow sections and virtuoso fireworks for soloist , brass and timpani .
At Avery Fisher Hall here , Mr. McDuffie was heard recently with Mr. Menuhin and the Warsaw Sinfonia in more conventional fare -- Bruch 's overwrought `` Violin Concerto in G Minor .
'' His performance was so effusive and driven that the phrases rarely breathed .
The 35-member Sinfonia played adroitly with a big , lush sound
that belied its size .
Whatever
he plays , Mr. McDuffie finds satisfaction in the music
itself -- `` something greater out there than me , '' as he puts it during an interview at the Manhattan apartment
he shares with wife , Camille , a literary publicist .
`` A normal person did not write the Beethoven ` Violin Concerto , ' '' he declares .
`` Even when I hear it played badly , I 'm still humbled by the piece .
If I could ever feel I 've contributed to it in some way , then all the hard work has been worth it .

William C. Walbrecher Jr. , an executive at San Francisco-based 1st Nationwide Bank , was named president and chief executive officer of Citadel Holding Corp. and its principal operating unit , Fidelity Federal Bank .
The appointment takes effect Nov. 13 .
He succeeds James A. Taylor , who stepped down as chairman , president and chief executive in March for health reasons .
Edward L. Kane succeeded Mr. Taylor as chairman .
Separately , Citadel posted a third-quarter net loss of $ 2.3 million , or 68 cents
a share , versus net income of $ 5.3 million , or $ 1.61
a share , a year earlier .
The latest results include some unusual write-downs , which had an after-tax impact of $ 4.9 million .
Those included costs associated with the potential Valley Federal Savings and Loan Association acquisition , which was terminated on Sept. 27 , 1989 .
In addition , operating results were hit by an increase in loan and real estate loss reserves .
In American Stock Exchange composite trading , Citadel shares closed yesterday at $ 45.75 , down 25 cents .

The Manville Personal Injury Settlement Trust said it is considering several ways to ease a liquidity crunch
that could include the sale of Manville Corp. to a third party .
In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission , the majority holder of Manville acknowledged that the cash portion of its initial funding of $ 765 million will be depleted next year , and that alternative sources of funds will be necessary to meet its obligations .
The trust , which was created as part of Manville 's bankruptcy-law reorganization to compensate victims of asbestos-related diseases , ultimately expects to receive $ 2.5 billion from Manville , but its cash flow from investments has so far lagged behind its payments to victims .
Spokespersons for both
the trust and the company refused to comment on whether any talks with a possible acquirer of Manville had actually taken place .
The trust is considering a sale of its Manville holdings , but Manville has the right of first refusal on any sales of its stock held by the trust .
Manville , a forest and building products concern , has offered to pay the trust $ 500 million for a majority of Manville 's convertible preferred stock .
Manville and the trust are discussing the offer , but no decision has been made .
The filing also said the trust is considering a sale of Manville securities in the open market ; an extraordinary dividend on the common stock ; or a recapitalization of Manville .
The Soviet Union 's jobless rate is soaring to 27 % in some areas , Pravda said .
It said the situation is caused by efforts to streamline bloated factory payrolls .
Unemployment has reached 27.6 % in Azerbaijan , 25.7 % in Tadzhikistan , 22.8 % in Uzbekistan , 18.8 % in Turkmenia , 18 % in Armenia and 16.3 % in Kirgizia , the Communist Party newspaper said .
All are non-Russian republics along the southern border of the Soviet Union , and all but Kirgizia have reported rioting in the past six months .
The newspaper said it is past time for the Soviet Union to create unemployment insurance and retraining programs like those of the West .
Pravda gave no estimate for overall unemployment but said an `` Association of the Unemployed '' has cropped up that says the number of jobless is 23 million Soviets , or 17 % of the work force .
An 11-week dispute involving Australia 's 1,640 domestic pilots has slashed airline earnings and crippled much of the continent 's tourist industry .
`` The only people
who are flying are those
who have to , '' said Frank Moore , chairman of the Australian Tourist Industry Association .
He added : `` How is a travel agent going to sell a holiday when he can not guarantee a return flight ?
'' Transport giant TNT , which owns half of one of the country 's two major domestic carriers , said the cost of the dispute had been heavy , cutting TNT 's profits 70 % to $ 12 million in the three months to Sept. 30 .
Brazilian financier Naji Nahas , who was arrested on Monday after 102 days in hiding , is likely to be interrogated next week by the Brazilian judiciary .
Mr. Nahas , who single-handedly provoked a one-day closure of Brazil 's stock markets in June when he failed to honor a debt of $ 31.1 million owed to his brokers , yesterday blamed his predicament on the president of the Sao Paulo stock exchange ; a few days before Mr. Nahas 's failure , the exchange raised the required margin on stock-margin transactions .
China 's parliament ousted two Hong Kong residents from a panel drafting a new constitution for the colony .
The two , Szeto Wah and Martin Lee , were deemed unfit because they had condemned China 's crackdown on its pro-democracy movement .
The committee is formulating Hong Kong 's constitution for when it reverts to Chinese control in 1997 , and Chinese lawmakers said the two can only return if they `` abandon their antagonistic stand against the Chinese government and their attempt to nullify the Sino-British joint declaration on Hong Kong .
NUCLEAR REACTOR FOR ISRAEL ?
Israeli officials confirmed that Energy Minister Moshe Shahal and his Canadian counterpart , Jake Epp , discussed a possible Israeli purchase of a $ 1.1 billion Canadian nuclear reactor for producing electricity .
However , a Canadian Embassy official in Tel Aviv said that Canada was unlikely to sell the Candu heavy-water reactor to Israel since Israel has n't signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty .
Israel has been accused in the past of using subterfuge to seek elements needed to develop nuclear weapons .
The South Korean government is signing a protocol today establishing formal diplomatic relations with Poland .
The two are also signing a trade agreement .
South Korean government officials said they do n't expect that Seoul can loan money to Warsaw , but it can `` offer experience .
'' Poland is the second Communist nation to recognize the Seoul government ; South Korea established diplomatic relations with Hungary in February 1989 .
Venezuela will hold a debt-equity auction Friday , with 32 potential bidders participating .
Earlier this year , Venezuela announced it was opening up debt-equity swaps to foreign investors but said the program would be limited to a net disbursement of $ 600 million
Friday 's auction will be limited to $ 150 million disbursed by the Central Bank to potential investors .
The office of foreign investment has authorized some $ 1.78 billion worth of investment proposals , said Edwin Perozo , superintendent of foreign investment .
Most of the proposals are in tourism , basic industry and fishery and agro-industry projects , he said .
Under the debt-equity program , potential investors will submit sealed bids on the percentage of discount
they are willing to purchase the debt at , and the bids will be allocated based on these discount offers .
The Venezuelan central bank set a 30 % floor on the bidding .
A song by American singer Tracy Chapman praising jailed black leader Nelson Mandela was banned from South African state radio and television .
The South African Broadcasting Corp. said the song `` Freedom Now '' was `` undesirable for broadcasting .
Britain 's House of Commons passed a law
that will force English soccer fans to carry identity cards to enter stadiums .
The `` anti-hooligan '' law , which would deprive troublemakers of cards , must be ratified by the House of Lords and is expected to become effective early next year .
Spending by average Japanese households in August fell an adjusted 1.9 % from a year earlier , the Statistics Bureau of the Prime Minister 's Office said .
The bureau cited typhoons in the month that discouraged shopping and leisure opportunities .
Spending by Japanese households averaged 290,782 yen ( $ 2,052.10 ) in August .
In nominal terms
it rose 0.6 % from a year earlier before adjustment .
August adjusted spending by wage-earning families was down 0.6 % to 309,381 yen from a year earlier .
The real income of wage-earning families in the month eased 1.2 % to 438,845 yen from the previous year .
Carl E. Pissocra , president and chief executive officer of Bank One , Dover , has been named regional president , a new post at the bank-holding company .
Mr. Pissocra , 56 years old , will be responsible for the company 's 10 banks in the Eastern region .
Dan J. Hartwell , 41 , executive vice president of Bank One , Dover , was named president and chief executive of the Dover bank , succeeding Mr. Pissocra .
No one was named to succeed Mr. Hartwell .
Delmed Inc. 's top two officers resigned and were succeeded by executives of Fresenius USA Inc. and its parent , Fresenius AG , a major Delmed holder
that has been negotiating to acquire a controlling stake .
In addition , Delmed , which makes and sells a dialysis solution used in treating kidney diseases , said negotiations about pricing had collapsed between it and a major distributor , National Medical Care Inc .
Delmed said Robert S. Ehrlich resigned as chairman , president and chief executive .
Mr. Ehrlich will continue as a director and a consultant .
Leslie I. Shapiro , chief operating officer and chief financial officer , also resigned , the company said .
Mr. Ehrlich was succeeded as chairman by Gerd Krick , a director of Fresenius , a West German pharmaceutical concern .
Ben Lipps , president of Fresenius USA , was named president , chief executive and chief operating officer .
None of the officials was available for comment .
In trading on the American Stock Exchange , Delmed closed at 50 cents , down 6.25 cents .
Fresenius owns about 42 % of Delmed 's fully diluted common stock .
The two companies have been discussing a transaction under which
Fresenius would buy Delmed stock for cash to bring its beneficial ownership to between 70 % and 80 % of Delmed 's fully diluted common stock .
The transaction also would combine Fresenius USA and Delmed .
Under the proposal , Delmed would issue about 123.5 million additional Delmed common shares to Fresenius at an average price of about 65 cents
a share , though under no circumstances more than 75 cents
Yesterday , Delmed said it `` continues to explore the possibility of a combination with Fresenius USA .
'' It added that it is apparent that any terms of a combination `` would be substantially less favorable than those previously announced .
While the discussions between Delmed and National Medical Care have been discontinued , Delmed will continue to supply dialysis products through National Medical after their exclusive agreement ends in March 1990 , Delmed said .
In addition , Delmed is exploring distribution arrangements with Fresenius USA , Delmed said .
Meson Investment Ltd. , a Vancouver , B.C.-based investment firm , said it raised its stake in Verit Industries to 8.9 % of the common shares outstanding .
In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing , Meson said it holds 67,400 Verit common shares , including net purchases of 8,100 shares bought from Oct. 10 , 1988 , to Oct. 11 , 1989 , for $ 3.875 to $ 7 each .
Meson is the personal holding company of Steven Morfey , a Vancouver securities dealer .
He said the transaction was made for investment purposes .
Officials for Sun Valley , Calif.-based Verit could n't be reached for comment .
In composite trading on the American Stock Exchange , Verit closed unchanged yesterday at $ 3.875
a share .
As expected , First Interstate Bancorp reported a net loss of $ 15.5 million for its third quarter because of hemorrhaging at its First Interstate Bank of Arizona unit .
The Los Angeles-based bank holding company disclosed last Friday that it had taken a huge $ 350 million provision for loan losses at the Arizona bank , the result of the state 's worsening real-estate market .
In yesterday 's report , First Interstate said its bank in Texas also reported a loss of $ 23.5 million for the quarter .
But it said that its consumer banks in Oregon , California , Nevada and Washington performed well during the quarter and that nonperforming assets at these banks declined by 14 % over the year-ago period .
When Michael S. Perry took the podium at a recent cosmetics industry event , more than 500 executives packing the room snapped to attention .
Mr. Perry , who runs Unilever Group 's world-wide personal-care business , paused to scan the crowd .
`` I see we have about half the audience working for us , '' he said , tongue in cheek .
`` The other half , we may have before long .
Members of the audience gasped or laughed nervously ; their industry has been unsettled recently by acquisitions .
First Unilever , the Anglo-Dutch packaged-goods giant , spent $ 2 billion to acquire brands such as Faberge and Elizabeth Arden .
It now holds the No. 3 position at U.S. department-store cosmetic counters .
Then Procter & Gamble Co. agreed to buy Noxell Corp. for $ 1.3 billion .
That acquisition , to be completed by year end , will include the Cover Girl and Clarion makeup lines , making P&G
the top marketer of cosmetics in mass-market outlets .
It 's not so much the idea of acquisitions
that has agitated the cosmetics industry as the companies doing the acquiring : P&G and Unilever bring with them great experience with mundane products like soap and toilet paper , sparking disdain in the glitzy cosmetics trade ; but they also bring mammoth marketing clout , sparking fear .
Though it is far from certain that companies best known for selling Promise margarine and Tide detergent will succeed in cosmetics , there
's little doubt
they will shake up the industry .
For now , both
companies are keeping quiet about their specific plans .
But industry watchers expect them to blend the methodical marketing strategies they use for more mundane products with the more intuitive approach typical of cosmetics companies .
Likely changes include more emphasis on research , soaring advertising budgets and aggressive pricing .
But some cosmetics-industry executives wonder whether techniques honed in packaged goods will translate to the cosmetics business .
Estee Lauder Inc. , Revlon Inc. and other cosmetics houses traditionally have considered themselves
fashion enterprises whose product development is guided by the creative intuition of their executives .
Cosmetics companies roll out new makeup colors several times
a year , and since most products can be easily copied by competitors , they 're loath to test them with consumers .
`` Just because upscale cosmetics look like packaged goods and smell like packaged goods , it does n't mean they are packaged goods , '' says Leonard Lauder , chief executive of Estee Lauder .
`` They 're really fashion items wrapped up in little jars .
In contrast to the more artistic nature of traditional cosmetics houses , Unilever and P&G are the habitats of organization men in gray-flannel suits .
companies are conservative marketers
that rely on extensive market research .
P&G , in particular , rarely rolls out a product nationally before extensive test-marketing .
Both can be extremely aggressive at pricing such products as soaps and diapers -- to the extent that some industry consultants predict cents-off coupons for mascara could result from their entry into the field .
P&G already has shown it can meld some traditional packaged-goods techniques with the image-making of the cosmetics trade in the mass-market end of the business .
Consider Oil of Olay , which
P&G acquired as part of Richardson-Vicks International in 1985 .
The moisturizer , introduced in 1962 , had a dowdy image .
`` Oil of Olay brought with it
the baggage of being used basically by older women
who had already aged , '' says David Williams , a consultant with New England Consulting Group .
P&G set out to reposition the brand by broadening the product line to include facial cleansers and moisturizers for sensitive skin .
It also redesigned Oil of Olay 's packaging , stamping the traditional pink boxes with gold lines to create a more opulent look .
Moreover , P&G shifted its ad campaign from one targeting older women to one featuring a woman in her mid-30s vowing `` not to grow old gracefully .
'' The company says sales have soared .
Goliaths like Unilever and P&G have enormous financial advantages over smaller rivals .
Next year , Noxell plans to roll out a perfume called Navy , says George L. Bunting Jr. , chairman of Noxell .
Without P&G 's backing , Noxell might not have been able to spend the estimated $ 5 million to $ 7 million needed to accomplish that without scrimping on its existing brands .
Packaged-goods companies `` will make it tougher for smaller people to remain competitive , '' Mr. Bunting says .
Further consolidations in the industry could follow .
Rumors that Unilever is interested in acquiring Schering-Plough Corp. 's Maybelline unit are widespread .
Unilever wo n't comment ; Schering , however , denies the brand is for sale .
The presence of Unilever and P&G is likely to increase the impact of advertising on cosmetics .
While the two are among the world 's biggest advertisers , most makers of upscale cosmetics spend relatively little on national ads .
Instead , they focus on events in department stores and pour their promotional budgets into gifts
that go along with purchases .
Estee Lauder , for example , spends only an estimated 5 % of sales on advertising in the U.S. , and Mr. Lauder says he has no plans to change his strategy .
The most dramatic changes , however , probably will come in new-product development .
Nearly 70 % of cosmetics sales come through mass-distribution outlets such as drug stores and supermarkets , according to Andrew Shore , an analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc .
That figure has been inching up for several years .
As the trend continues , demand for mass-market items
that are high quality but only mid-priced -- particularly skin-care products -- is expected to increase .
This fall , for example , L'Oreal Group , ordinarily a high-end line , rolled out a drug-store line of skin-care products called Plenitude , which retail for $ 5 to $ 15 .
The packaged-goods marketers may try filling that gap with a spate of new products .
Unlike the old-line cosmetics houses , Unilever and P&G
both have enormous research and development bases to draw on for new products .
P&G , in fact , is noted for gaining market leadership by introducing products
that offer a technical edge over the competition .
Sales of its Tide detergent soared earlier this year , for example , after P&G introduced a version
that includes a bleach safe for all colors and fabrics .
That 's led industry executives to speculate that future product development will be driven more by technological innovation than by fashion whims -- especially among mass-market brands .
`` There will be more emphasis on quality , '' says Guy Peyrelongue , chief executive of Cosmair Inc. , the U.S. licensee of L'Oreal .
`` You 'll see fewer gimmicks .
But success for Unilever and P&G is far from guaranteed , as shown by the many consumer-product companies
that have tried and failed to master the quirky beauty business .
In the 1970s , several pharmaceutical and packaged-goods companies , including Colgate-Palmolive Co. , Eli Lilly & Co. , Pfizer Inc. and Schering-Plough acquired cosmetics companies .
Industry consultants say only Schering-Plough , which makes the mass-market Maybelline , has maintained a meaningful business .
Colgate , which acquired Helena Rubenstein in 1973 , sold the brand seven years later after the brand languished .
Unilever already has experienced some disappointment .
The mass-market Aziza brand , which
it acquired in 1987 along with Chesebrough-Pond 's Inc. , has lost share , according to industry analysts .
The ritzy world of department-store cosmetics retailing , where Unilever is concentrating its efforts , may prove even more treacherous .
In this niche , makeup colors change seasonally because they are linked to ready-to-wear fashions .
Because brand loyalty is weak and most cosmetics purchases are unplanned , careful training of store sales staffs by cosmetics companies is important .
And cultivating a luxury image strong enough to persuade consumers to pay more than $ 15 for lipstick or eye makeup requires a subtle touch that packaged-goods companies have yet to demonstrate on their own .
A federal judge in Manhattan has entered a judgment requiring a Chicago organized crime figure to pay the government $ 250,000 , representing alleged profits
he gained from his involvement with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters .
Manhattan U.S. Attorney Otto Obermaier said it was the first time ever that the government had obtained any disgorgement from an organized crime figure indicted under the civil racketeering law .
Joseph Lombardo , who
the government alleged was the `` captain '' of organized crime in Chicago , was one of numerous defendants in the government 's sweeping racketeering suit against the Teamsters .
In the suit , filed in June 1988 , the government accused the union 's leadership of depriving its 1.6 million members of their rights through a pattern of racketeering .
Among other things , the government claimed that organized crime figures had routinely handpicked the union 's top officials .
U.S. District Judge David Edelstein also permanently enjoined Mr. Lombardo from any future dealings with the Teamsters or any other labor union .
Mr. Lombardo , the last of the defendants to settle the suit , agreed to pay the government
the $ 250,000 within one week .
The U.S. International Trade Commission issued preliminary rulings under the U.S. anti-dumping act that imports of sweaters from Hong Kong , Taiwan and South Korea may be injuring a domestic industry .
Because of the rulings , the Commerce Department will continue to investigate complaints by U.S. sweater makers that the imports are reaching the U.S. at unfairly low prices in violation of the U.S. anti-dumping act .
The law defines unfairly low prices as ones below the cost of production or below prices in an exporter 's home market .
ITC officials said final Commerce Department and ITC rulings wo n't come until next March or later .
If both
agencies find violations of the U.S. trade law , the U.S. would assess penalty duties on the imports , which already are subject to import quotas under bilateral textile and apparel trade agreements .
Imports of manmade-fiber sweaters in 1988 totaled about $ 405 million from Taiwan , $ 400 million from South Korea and $ 125 million from Hong Kong , according to the ITC .
In another action , the ITC dismissed anti-dumping act complaints filed by Du Pont Co. of Wilmington , Del. , against imports of neoprene , a type of synthetic rubber , from France and West Germany .
These imports totaled about $ 17 million last year .
With the dust settling from the failed coup attempt in Panama , one of the many lingering questions
the Bush administration will ponder is this : Is the National Security Council staff big enough , and does it have enough clout , to do its job of coordinating foreign policy ?
President Bush 's national security adviser , Lt. Gen. Brent Scowcroft , came into office in January intent on making the NSC staff leaner and more disciplined than it had been during the Reagan administration .
Gen. Scowcroft was a member of the Tower Commission , which investigated the Iran-Contra affair .
He was all too aware of how a large , inadequately supervised NSC staff had spun out of control and nearly wrecked President Reagan 's second term .
So , following both
the style
he pursued as President Ford 's national security adviser and the recommendations of the Tower Commission , Gen. Scowcroft has pruned the NSC staff and tried to ensure that it sticks to its assigned tasks -- namely , gathering the views of the State Department , Pentagon and intelligence community ; serving as an honest broker in distilling that information for the president and then making sure presidential decisions are carried out .
The Tower Commission specifically said that the NSC staff should be `` small '' and warned against letting `` energetic self-starters '' like Lt. Col. Oliver North strike out on their own rather than leaving the day-to-day execution of policies to the State Department , Pentagon or Central Intelligence Agency .
However , the Panama episode has raised questions about whether the NSC staff is sufficiently big , diverse and powerful to coordinate U.S. policy on tough issues .
During the coup attempt and its aftermath , NSC staffers were `` stretched very thin , '' says one senior administration official .
`` It 's a very small shop .
Gen. Scowcroft does n't plan to increase the staff right now , but is weighing that possibility , the official adds .
The NSC staff `` does n't have the horsepower that I believe is required to have an effective interagency process , '' says Frank Gaffney , a former Pentagon aide
who now runs the Center for Security Policy , a conservative Washington think-tank .
`` The problem with this administration , I think , is that by design
it has greatly diminished , both in a physical sense and in a procedural sense , the role of the NSC .
The National Security Council itself was established in 1947 because policy makers sensed a need , in an increasingly complex world , for a formal system within the White House to make sure that communications flowed smoothly between the president and the State Department , Pentagon and intelligence agencies .
By law , the council includes the president , vice president and secretaries of state and defense .
In practice , the director of central intelligence and chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff also serve as unofficial members .
But the size , shape and role of the NSC staff have been left for each president and his national security adviser to decide .
That task is one of Washington 's perennial problems .
In the Bush White House , the size of the NSC 's staff of professional officers is down to about 50 from about 70 in 1987 , administration officials say .
Administration officials insist that the size of the staff was n't
a problem during the Panama crisis .
But one clear problem during the coup attempt was that the NSC staffer most experienced in Latin America , Everett Briggs , was gone .
He had just resigned , at least in part because of a feud with Assistant Secretary of State Bernard Aronson over the administration 's policy on Panama and support for Nicaragua 's Contra rebels .
The absence of Mr. Briggs underscored the possible inadequacy of the current NSC staff .
Both Gen. Scowcroft and his deputy , Robert Gates , are experts in U.S.-Soviet affairs .
Gen. Scowcroft is particularly well-versed in arms control , and Mr. Gates has spent years studying Soviet politics and society .
Both have become confidants of President Bush .
But neither has an extensive background in Latin America , the Middle East or Asia .
In those areas , the role of NSC staffers under them therefore have become more important .
Gen. Scowcroft knows as well as anyone that one of the biggest dangers
he faces is that NSC staffers working in relative anonymity will take over policy-making and operational tasks
that are best left to bigger and more experienced State Department and Pentagon bureaus .
But just as every previous NSC adviser has , Gen. Scowcroft now will have to mull at what point
the NSC staff becomes too lean and too restrained .
French chemicals group , Orkem S.A. , said Wednesday
it has made a bid for control of Coates Brothers PLC , a British manufacturer of inks and polyester resins .
State-controlled Orkem already owns 40.6 % of Coates .
The remainder is held by the public and by family interests , a spokeswoman for the French group said .
Orkem declined to give details of its offer , saying only that the bid will be submitted for approval by the board of the British company .
Federal investigators have identified the problem in last July 's crash of a United Airlines flight in Iowa : a structural flaw that developed during the making of a titanium engine disk .
For several months , officials at the Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board have suspected that a metallurgical flaw in the disk led to a crack
that ultimately caused the tail engine to break apart in flight .
The explosion sent shards of metal flying , severing the DC-10 's hydraulic or control systems , and led to the crash
that killed 112 people .
But investigators could confirm their theory only after the recent retrieval of a big chunk of Flight 232 's tail engine from a cornfield near the Sioux City Airport in Iowa .
The safety board will begin four days of hearings on the accident tomorrow in Sioux City .
Among the issues
the board will examine is whether United Airlines , a unit of UAL Corp. , should have been able to detect the cracks through maintenance checks .
The engine involved was a CF6-6 made by General Electric Co .
Anthony Broderick , the FAA 's acting executive director for regulatory standards and compliance , said that recent tests of the failed engine disk indicate that a flaw -- known as `` hard alpha '' -- occurred in the titanium during its production almost 20 years ago .
He said there was n't any way to detect the flaw at that time , and that the process has since been changed to decrease the chance that such flaws would occur .
The FAA already has ordered that all 232 disks made by the old process be removed from the planes and subjected to an ultrasonic test in a water-submersion chamber .
Such tests make the FAA confident that a Sioux City-type accident `` wo n't happen again , '' said Mr. Broderick .
A spokesman for GE said that the company has been working with the FAA all along on this issue and `` will comply fully with the required inspections .
'' But he also pointed out that the recalls will have no impact on GE 's engine production .
The CF6-6 series engines are n't being manufactured any more ; they are only being used in the DC-10 Series 10 planes currently in service , he said .
Leon J. Level , vice president and chief financial officer of this computer services concern , and F. Warren McFarlan , a professor at Harvard University 's Graduate School of Business , were elected directors , increasing board membership to nine .
Several of the New York Stock Exchange 's own listed companies , led by giant Contel Corp. , are joining for the first time to complain about program trading and the exchange 's role in it .
Claiming program trading has turned the Big Board into a `` gambling casino , '' Contel Chairman Charles Wohlstetter said that he and at least 20 other corporate executives are forming an unprecedented alliance .
The group , Mr. Wohlstetter said in an interview , wants to end the market 's wild price swings that critics blame on computer-aided program-trading strategies .
The group will complain to Washington , to the heads of program-trading firms and to the heads of the Big Board itself , he said .
`` They should call { the exchange } Trump East , '' charged Mr. Wohlstetter , the 79-year-old founder of Contel
who 's also a former investment banker and stock trader .
`` What is the mission of the financial community -- to help some scavengers or schemers , or help corporate America ?
'' Contel is a $ 6 billion telephone and electronics company .
Pressure has been building on the Big Board in the past two weeks to do something about market volatility , which
many investors say is caused by program trading .
The market 's Friday-the-13th plunge of 190 points in the Dow Jones Industrial Average , and the Big Board 's understated response to it , galvanized some longstanding dissatisfaction among companies listed on the exchange .
Last month , program trading accounted for a record 13.8 % of average daily Big Board volume .
Mr. Wohlstetter , for example , said he wrote to Big Board Chairman John J. Phelan Jr. about program trading after the 190-point Dow plunge , and as in previous queries , `` what
I get back is gobbledygook .
'' He said he 's upset that Mr. Phelan , trying to calm investors after the plunge , said that investors would simply have to get used to the market 's big price swings .
The Big Board `` is partly to blame { for the price swings } , because they 're cowards , '' said Mr. Wohlstetter .
`` Their powerful members manage them .
The focus of the outcry has been stock-index arbitrage , which accounts for about half the program trading that goes on .
Index arbitragers argue that their trading is healthy because it links markets , but critics say such trading accelerates market movements and increases the chance for a crash .
The Big Board has refused to be drawn into a public debate about program trading .
Richard Grasso , Big Board president , last week said only that the exchange is concerned about all its constituents .
Privately , exchange officials worry that without a hospitable system for program trading at the Big Board , billions of dollars in trading will simply migrate to overseas exchanges such as London 's .
It is partly for this reason that the exchange last week began trading in its own stock `` basket '' product
that allows big investors to buy or sell all 500 stocks in the Standard & Poor 's index in a single trade .
One intended customer of the new basket product is index arbitragers , according to the exchange .
Investors have complained for some time about program trading , particularly index arbitrage , to little avail .
But according to some Big Board traders , an organized campaign from exchange-listed companies might make the exchange finally consider big changes .
`` They wo n't fight the listed companies .
Now the assault is on , '' said one top trader .
The Big Board ca n't ban stock-index futures , of course , but it could ban use of its high-speed electronic trading system for program trading or at least encourage securities firms to back off .
The exchange put a bit of a damper on program trading when , last year , it simply started to publish monthly statistics of each firm 's program-trading volume .
Contel 's Mr. Wohlstetter said the group of Big Board companies is n't ready to go public yet with its effort , and that he does n't plan to be the leader once it is public .
However , he said he planned to spend the weekend making calls to gather additional support .
Among those Mr. Wohlstetter said he has been talking to are Sanford Weill of Primerica Corp. , which is the parent of Smith Barney , Harris Upham & Co. ; GTE Corp. 's James Johnson , and ITT Corp. 's Rand Araskog .
None of these chief executives were available for comment .
Among the targets of the Big Board companies ' campaign will be some corporate pension funds
that use program-trading strategies to maximize returns on their investments .
For Contel 's part , the company
a month ago informed each of its money managers that it would drop them if they give business to program-trading firms .
It was just those kinds of ultimatums that last week succeeded in turning up the heat in the debate .
Kemper Corp. 's Kemper Financial Services unit said it cut off Bear Stearns , Morgan Stanley , Oppenheimer and General Electric Co. 's Kidder , Peabody & Co. unit .
All of the firms except Kidder , which is the second-biggest program trader on Wall Street , quickly announced pull-backs from index arbitrage .
Kidder officials stand by their aggressive use of program trading .
Chief Executive Officer Michael Carpenter said that despite the outcry even by some of Kidder 's own brokers , he believes index arbitrage does n't have a `` negative impact on the market as a whole .
'' However , pressure on Kidder 's parent , GE , could change Kidder 's policy .
GE Chairman John Welch has been `` besieged with phone calls '' complaining about his unit 's program trading , according to a person close to him .
Although his team lost the World Series , San Francisco Giants owner Bob Lurie hopes to have a new home for them .
He is an avid fan of a proposition on next week 's ballot to help build a replacement for Candlestick Park .
Small wonder , since he 's asking San Francisco taxpayers to sink up to $ 100 million into the new stadium .
As San Francisco digs out from The Pretty Big One , opponents say the last thing
the city can afford is an expensive new stadium .
A stadium craze is sweeping the country .
It 's fueled by the increasing profitability of major-league teams .
Something like one-third of the nation 's 60 largest cities are thinking about new stadiums , ranging from Cleveland to San Antonio and St. Petersburg .
Most boosters claim the new sports complexes will be moneymakers for their city .
Pepperdine University economist Dean Baim scoffs at that .
He has looked at 14 baseball and football stadiums and found that only one -- private Dodger Stadium -- brought more money into a city than it took out .
Stadiums tend to redistribute existing wealth within a community , not create more of it .
Voters generally agree when they are given a chance to decide if they want to sink their own tax dollars into a new mega-stadium .
San Francisco voters rejected a new ballpark two years ago .
Last month , Phoenix voters turned thumbs down on a $ 100 million stadium bond and tax proposition .
Its backers fielded every important interest on their team -- a popular mayor , the Chamber of Commerce , the major media -- and spent $ 100,000 on promotion .
But voters decided that if the stadium was such a good idea
someone would build it
himself , and rejected it
59 % to 41 % .
In San Francisco , its backers concede the ballpark is at best running even in the polls .
George Christopher , the former San Francisco mayor
who built Candlestick Park for the Giants in the 1960s , wo n't endorse the new ballpark .
He says he had Candlestick built because the Giants claimed they needed 10,000 parking spaces .
Since the new park will have only 1,500 spaces , Mr. Christopher thinks backers are playing some fiscal `` games '' of their own with the voters .
Stadium boosters claim that without public money
they would never be built .
Miami Dolphins owner Joe Robbie disagrees , and he can prove it .
Several years ago he gave up trying to persuade Miami to improve its city-owned Orange Bowl , and instead built his own $ 100 million coliseum with private funds .
He did n't see why the taxpayers should help build something
he would then use to turn a healthy profit .
`` This stadium shows that anything
government can do , we can do better , '' Mr. Robbie says .
But to Moon Landrieu , the former New Orleans mayor
who helped build that city 's cavernous , money-losing Superdome , questions of who
benefits or the bottom line are of little relevance .
`` The Superdome is an exercise in optimism , a statement of faith , '' he has said .
`` It is the very building of it
that is important , not how much of it is used or its economics .
An Egyptian Pharaoh could n't have justified his pyramids any better .
But civilization has moved forward since then .
Today taxpayers get to vote , most of the time , on whether they want to finance the building schemes of our modern political pharaohs , or let private money erect these playgrounds for public passions .
NICHOLS INSTITUTE declared a 2-for-1 split of its common stock , payable Nov. 27 to stock of record Nov. 10 .
The clinical testing services holding company is based in San Juan Capistrano , Calif .
Trinova Corp. said it will resume buying back as many as three million of its common shares under a program announced two years ago .
Trinova , which had 34.2 million common shares outstanding Sept. 30 , had repurchased 29,700 shares since October 1987 before this latest announcement .
The company said it is n't making a commitment to purchase a specific number of shares .
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday , Trinova closed at $ 32.125 , up 12.5 cents .
Italy 's trade deficit narrowed to 2.007 trillion lire ( $ 1.49 billion ) in September from 2.616 trillion lire
a year earlier , the state statistical office Istat said .
The deficit was 466 billion lire in August .
For the first nine months , the trade deficit was 14.933 trillion lire , compared with 10.485 trillion lire in the year-earlier period .
Istat said the statistics are provisional and are n't seasonally adjusted .
Imports rose 11 % to 18.443 trillion lire in September from a year earlier , while exports rose 17 % to 16.436 trillion lire .
In the nine months , imports rose 20 % to 155.039 trillion lire , while exports grew 18 % to 140.106 trillion lire .
Import values are calculated on a cost , insurance and freight ( c.i.f .
) basis , while exports are accounted for on a free-on-board ( f.o.b .
) basis .
Technology stocks woke up , helping the over-the-counter market rise from its recent doldrums .
The Nasdaq Composite Index surged 4.26 , or about 0.94 % , to 455.63 .
It was the market 's biggest gain since rising more than 7 points on Oct. 19 .
Advancing OTC stocks outpaced decliners by 1,120 to 806 .
But the move lagged a stronger rise in New York Stock Exchange issues .
The Big Board 's composite index was up more than 1.4 % , and the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 1.6 % .
Nasdaq 's gain was led by its biggest industrial stocks .
The Nasdaq 100 rose 7.08 to 445.23 .
The Financial Index of 100 biggest banks and insurance issues added 2.19 to 447.76 .
Other strong sectors were indicated in gains of the Transportation Index , up 7.55 to 475.35 , and the Utility Index , up 8.68 to 730.37 .
National Market System volume improved to 94,425,000 shares from 71.7 million Monday .
Many of Nasdaq 's biggest technology stocks were in the forefront of the rally .
Microsoft added 2 1\/8 to 81 3\/4 and Oracle Systems rose 1 1\/2 to 23 1\/4 .
Intel was up 1 3\/8 to 33 3\/4 .
But traders
who watch the stocks warned the rise may be yet another `` one-day phenomenon .
Technology stocks bore the brunt of the OTC market 's recent sell-off , and traders say it
's natural that they rebound sharply now that the market has turned around .
But , they caution , conservative investors would do well to sell into the strength .
`` They are always the first to be sold when people are taking profits , because people are most scared of the high-technology stocks , '' said Robin West , director of research for Ladenburg Thalmann 's Lanyi division , which specializes in emerging growth stocks .
The technology group includes many of the OTC market 's biggest stocks , which dominate the market-weighted Nasdaq Composite Index .
Analysts say rallies in the group historically have lifted the market , while weakness in the sector often sank unlisted share prices broadly .
But increasing volatility in the sector has exhausted investors
who try to follow its dips and swings .
The stocks have been pummeled repeatedly by inventory gluts and disappointing earnings as the industry matures and slows .
Some even claim the group has become a lagging , not leading , indicator .
The technology sector of the Dow Jones Equity Market Index has risen only about 6.24 %
this year , while the Nasdaq Composite Index has gained 18.35 % .
While the composite index lost less than a third of its year-to-date gains in the market 's recent decline , the technology group 's gains were more than halved .
The OTC technology sector is far from a cohesive unit .
The group is divided primarily between software , semiconductors and computers .
While computer stocks have taken the biggest hit from the slowdown in the industry , many software and semiconductor stocks have continued to outperform the market .
Microsoft is up more than 50 %
this year , while Intel is up more than 40 % .
The technology group is also split between large companies and small , with the biggest stocks trading as blue-chip issues in the institutional marketplace , while the smaller stocks churn on their individual merits or faults , analysts say .
The volatility of smaller technology companies has served the group well overall in recent stock trading , according to Hambrecht & Quist 's technology stock indexes .
The brokerage firm tracks technology stocks with its Technology Index , which appreciated only 10.59 % in the first nine months of this year .
But the firm also tracks smaller technology companies as a subset of the larger group .
That index , which contains technology companies with annual revenues of $ 200 million or less , gained 17.97 % by Sept. 30 this year -- still lagging the S&P 500 , but leading larger technology firms .
Yesterday , bank stocks lagged behind the overall OTC market .
The Nasdaq Bank Index rose 0.17 to 432.78 .
George Jennison , who trades bank stocks for Shearson Lehman Hutton , said the stocks tend to fall behind because they are n't traded as much as many other issues .
But , he added , interest-rate-sensitive stocks in general are stalled .
`` The interest-rate sensitives are n't rallying with the rest of the market because of fears about what
the ( Federal Reserve ) will do , '' Mr. Jennison said .
He said that investors will scour the October employment report , due out Friday , for clues about the direction of the economy and the immediate outlook for interest rates .
On the other hand , Mr. Jennison noted that the recent slide in bank and thrift stocks was at least halted yesterday .
Shearson Lehman Hutton gave small investors
some welcome news by announcing that it would no longer handle index-arbitrage-related program trades for its accounts .
Shearson , with its in-house order execution system , has handled the bulk of such program trades in the over-the-counter market .
The trading has been blamed for much of the market 's recent volatility .
Jaguar topped the most-active list , as its American depository receipts climbed 1 3\/4 to 13 5\/8 with more than 6.6 million ADRs traded .
Britain said it would waive its `` golden share '' in the luxury auto maker if shareholders vote to allow a suitor to acquire more than 15 % of the company .
The announcement effectively removes the British government as an impediment to a takeover of the company , which is being stalked by General Motors and Ford .
Gen-Probe was another active takeover stock .
It surged 2 3\/4 to 6 on volume of more than 1.7 million shares after the company agreed to be acquired by Japan 's Chugai Pharmaceutical for about $ 110 million -- almost double the market price of Gen-Probe 's stock .
Priam Corp. lost 5\/32 to 3\/32 after filing for protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code .
MCI Communications added 1 1\/2 to 43 3\/8 .
The company has toted up over $ 40 million in contracts in the past two days .
Monday , MCI announced a $ 27 million multiyear contract with the investment bank Stuart-James .
Yesterday , it received a $ 15 million , three-year contract from Drexel Burnham Lambert .
Florida National Banks of Fla. slid 1 1\/8 to 24 3\/4 .
Late Monday , the Federal Reserve Board said it is delaying approval of First Union Corp. 's proposed $ 849 million acquisition of Florida National Banks pending the outcome of an examination into First Union 's lending practices in low-income heighborhoods .
Florida National said yesterday that it remains committed to the merger .
Dycom Industries gained 3\/4 to 16 3\/4 after it said it agreed to buy Ansco & Associates and two affiliates for cash and stock .
The value of the transaction was n't disclosed .
The companies being acquired provide telecommunications services to the telephone industry .
Willamette Industries , whose stock has suffered steep losses in recent sessions , surged 1 1\/2 to 49 .
The stock was one of many in the paper products industry
that rose following Georgia-Pacific 's $ 3.18 billion bid for Great Northern Nekoosa .

Make a lasting difference in the regulatory life of an American savings-and-loan association through the Foster Corporate Parents Plan .
Americans today spend $ 15,000 like pocket change -- they do n't think much about it .
But for an ailing savings-and-loan association -- teetering on insolvency -- it can lead to safety from imminent demise and to a future full of promise .
Your $ 15,000 will help keep a needy savings and loan solvent -- and out of the federal budget deficit .
As a Foster Corporate Parent , you 'll be helping a neighborhood S&L in areas crucial to its survival .
Like healthy regulatory capital .
A steady deposit base .
Performing loans .
At the same time , you 'll give your Foster Savings Institution
the gift of hope and freedom from the federal regulators
who want to close its doors -- for good .
As a Foster Corporate Parent , you will experience the same joy felt by Robert Bass , Lewis Ranieri , William Simon and others , who find ways to help troubled savings institutions and their employees help themselves .
That builds confidence , self sufficiency , not to mention critical regulatory net worth .
Do n't wait -- a savings institution needs your help now !
Every day
you delay , a savings institution 's health -- and the federal budget deficit -- grows worse .
Think about the good you can do for just $ 15,000
a month , about the cost of a mid-size Chevrolet or two semesters at a state university .
Then send your support to a savings institution
that has taken a bad rap in the press and on its bottom line .
Every $ 15,000
you send will go a long way to boost sagging net worth and employee morale -- and keep your Foster Savings Institution off the federal budget deficit !

OPEC 's ability to produce more petroleum than it can sell is beginning to cast a shadow over world oil markets .
Output from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is already at a high for the year and most member nations are running flat out .
But industry and OPEC officials agree that a handful of members still have enough unused capacity to glut the market and cause an oil-price collapse
a few months from now if OPEC does n't soon adopt a new quota system to corral its chronic cheaters .
As a result , the effort by some oil ministers to get OPEC to approve a new permanent production-sharing agreement next month is taking on increasing urgency .
The organization is scheduled to meet in Vienna beginning Nov. 25 .
So far this year , rising demand for OPEC oil and production restraint by some members have kept prices firm despite rampant cheating by others .
But that could change if demand for OPEC 's oil softens seasonally early next year as some think may happen .
OPEC is currently producing more than 22 million barrels
a day , sharply above its nominal , self-imposed fourth-quarter ceiling of 20.5 million , according to OPEC and industry officials at an oil conference here sponsored by the Oil Daily and the International Herald Tribune .
At that rate , a majority of OPEC 's 13 members have reached their output limits , they said .
But it is estimated that at least three million barrels
a day -- and possibly as much as seven million barrels
a day -- of spare capacity still exists within OPEC .
Most is concentrated in five Persian Gulf countries , including his own , Issam Al-Chalabi , Iraq 's oil minister , told the conference Friday .
He puts OPEC 's current capacity at 28 million to 29 million barrels
a day .
That 's higher than some other estimates .
Ali Khalifa Al-Sabah , Kuwait 's oil minister , recently estimated OPEC capacity at 25 million barrels
Either way , the overhang is big enough to keep delicately balanced oil markets on edge .
Even modest amounts of additional output by those with the huge extra capacity and reserves , such as Saudi Arabia and Iraq , could upset the market .
The Iraqi oil minister and Saudi oil minister Hisham Nazer insisted in their comments to the conference that their countries would act responsibly to maintain a stable market .
However , in interviews later , both
ministers stressed that they expect future OPEC quotas to be based mainly on the production capacity and reserves of each member .
Under that approach , countries with the most unused oil capacity would get bigger shares of any future increases in OPEC 's production ceiling than they would under the current system .
`` If you are already producing at 95 % or 100 % of your capacity , what 's the good to be told you can produce at 105 % of capacity ? '' asked Mr. Al-Chalabi .
At an inconclusive Geneva meeting late last month , OPEC 's oil ministers halfheartedly approved another increase of one million barrels
a day in their production ceiling .
They doled it out using the existing formula , however , which meant that even those countries
that could n't produce more received higher official allotments .
The main effect of the ceiling boost was to `` legitimize '' some of the overproduction already coming from the quota cheaters .
Still , there was a breakthrough at Geneva .
Previously , no OPEC member had been willing to accept a reduction in its percentage share of the group 's total output target , or ceiling .
But the concept of disproportionate quotas for those with unused capacity , advanced there in an Iranian proposal , was generally endorsed by the ministers .
In the end politics got in the way .
Libya accepted Iran 's proposal only so long as it was promised production parity with Kuwait .
And the United Arab Emirates , a chronic quota cheater , refused to give any guarantee
it would change its ways .
But the oil ministers continue to study the plan , and it will probably be the basis for discussion at next month 's meeting .
It 's understood several compromises already have been worked into the plan .
The ceiling would be lifted to 21.5 million barrels to provide Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates much higher official quotas while reducing percentage shares of some others .
Libya 's previous conditions are no longer considered a problem , although the United Arab Emirates is still an issue .
Saudi Arabia , OPEC 's kingpin , also has surfaced as a possible obstacle , some OPEC sources said .
Insisting on a 24.5 % share of any ceiling , Saudi officials have long pressed for the pro rata distribution of increases to all members .
In Geneva , however , they supported Iran 's proposal because it would have left the Saudi percentage of the OPEC total intact , and increased actual Saudi volume to nearly 5.3 million barrels daily from five million .
Some of the proposed modifications since , however , call on Saudi Arabia to `` give back '' to the production-sharing pool
a token 23,000 barrels .
Though tiny , that 's a reduction in its share .
Mr. Nazer , the Saudi oil minister , reiterated here that the kingdom would insist on maintaining its percentage share of OPEC production under any quota revisions .
`` Under any circumstances , Saudi Arabia should get more '' rather than less , Mr. Nazer said .
Two gunmen entered a Maryland restaurant , ordered two employees to lie on the floor and shot them in the backs of their heads .
The killers fled with less than $ 100 .
Describing this and other grisly killings , Sen. Strom Thurmond ( R. , S.C .
) recently urged fellow lawmakers to revive a broad federal death penalty .
`` The ultimate punishment , '' he declared , `` will protect the law-abiding from the vicious , cruel individuals
who commit these crimes .
There 's just one problem : The law that Sen. Thurmond is pushing would be irrelevant in the case of the Maryland restaurant murders and almost all other killings .
Most murders are state crimes , so any federal capital-punishment law probably would turn out to be more symbolism than substance .
Yet the bill is riding high on the furor over drug trafficking .
Senate Republicans , after repeatedly failing to attach death-penalty amendments to unrelated legislation , have finally gotten a full-blown death-penalty bill through committee .
The Democratic leadership agreed to allow a floor vote on the issue before the end of the year -- a debate certain to focus on the alleged racial inequality of death sentencing .
Even some Democrats concede that there is probably a majority in the Senate
that favors some kind of broad capital-punishment measure .
The pending bill , introduced by Mr. Thurmond , would revive the long-dormant federal death-penalty laws by instituting legal procedures required by the Supreme Court .
In 1972 , the high court swept aside all capital-punishment laws -- federal and state alike -- as unconstitutional .
But in 1976 , the court permitted resurrection of such laws , if they meet certain procedural requirements .
For instance , juries would have to consider specific `` aggravating '' and `` mitigating '' factors before deciding whether to condemn someone to death .
Since that 1976 ruling , 37 states have reintroduced the death penalty .
But congressional Democrats have blocked the same from occurring at the federal level , with the exception of a 1988 law allowing capital punishment for certain drug-related homicides .
The Thurmond bill would establish a federally administered death sentence for 23 crimes , most of which were formerly punishable by death under federal statutes that the Supreme Court invalidated .
Among these crimes are murder on federal land , presidential assassination and espionage .
The Thurmond bill would also add five new crimes punishable by death , including murder for hire .
( Separately , the Senate last week passed a bill permitting execution of terrorists
who kill Americans abroad .
Amid the swirl of punitive rhetoric surrounding the issue , one critical question involves whether a federal death penalty , on top of existing state laws , would deter any would-be criminals .
For one thing , it 's unlikely that many people would receive federal death sentences , let alone be executed .
Most of the crimes incorporated in the Thurmond bill are exceedingly rare -- killing a Supreme Court justice , for instance , or deliberately causing a train wreck
that results in a death .
In fact , only 28 defendants would have been eligible for federal death sentences if the Thurmond bill had been in effect in the past three years , according to a study by the Senate Judiciary Committee 's Democratic staff .
The last federal execution before the Supreme Court 's 1972 ruling banning the death penalty took place in 1963 , meaning that the federal government did n't exercise its execution authority for eight years .
`` In that sense , the whole debate is sort of a fraud , '' argues a Democratic Senate staff member .
`` It 's distracting attention from serious issues , like how to make DEA , FBI and Customs work together '' on drug enforcement .
Republicans acknowledge that few people would be executed under the Thurmond bill , but they contend that is n't the point .
`` Many scholars are of the opinion that the mere existence of the penalty deters many people from the commission of capital crimes , '' says Sen. Orrin Hatch ( R. , Utah ) .
Executions , regardless of how frequently they occur , are also `` proper retribution '' for heinous crimes , Mr. Hatch argues .
Thomas Boyd , a senior Justice Department official , says the new federal drug-related crimes punishable by death since last November may result in a jump in capital sentences , though that has n't happened so far .
In addition to resuscitating the old issue of whether death sentences deter criminals , this bill has made race
a major part of the death-penalty debate .
Before the bill left committee , Sen. Edward Kennedy ( D. , Mass .
) attached an amendment
that would allow a defendant to escape from a death sentence in jurisdictions shown to have meted out executions in a racist manner .
The amendment prompted an ironic protest from Mr. Thurmond , who complained that it would `` kill '' capital punishment .
A large number of studies suggest that state judges and juries have imposed the penalty in a racially discriminatory fashion .
And the Kennedy amendment would invade not only federal but state sentencings , in two important ways .
It would allow all defendants to introduce statistical evidence showing racially disproportionate application of the death penalty in the past .
And it would shift the burden to prosecutors to disprove that discrimination caused any statistical racial disparities .
`` That burden is very difficult , if not impossible , to meet , '' says Mr. Boyd .
`` How do you prove a negative ?
'' Since most prosecutors would n't be able to demonstrate conclusively that racial considerations did n't affect sentencing , executions everywhere might come to a halt , Mr. Boyd explains .
At least 15 major studies purport to show that particular states have imposed the death penalty disproportionately against killers of whites compared with blacks , and against black defendants compared with white defendants .
Conservatives question the validity of the studies and note that the Supreme Court ruled in 1987 that such research , regardless of its accuracy , is n't relevant to a constitutional attack on a particular death sentence .
The Kennedy amendment would , in effect , legislate around the Supreme Court ruling .
Lawyers would eagerly seize on the provision in their death-penalty appeals , says Richard Burr , director of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund 's capital-punishment defense team .
Mr. Kennedy failed to get his amendment incorporated into last year 's anti-drug legislation , and it will be severely attacked on the Senate floor
this time around .
But if it survives , it could prompt other statutory changes , according to the Mr. Burr .
It might force Congress and the states to narrow the death penalty only to convictions shown to be relatively free of racial imbalance -- murders by repeat offenders
who torture their victims , perhaps .
Narrowing the penalty in this fashion would clearly reduce whatever deterrent effect
it now has .
And that , in turn , would only strengthen the argument of those
who oppose execution under any circumstances .
Vickers PLC , a United Kingdom defense and engineering company , said an investment unit controlled by New Zealand financier Ron Brierley raised its stake in the company Friday to 15.02 % from about 14.6 % Thursday and from 13.7 %
the previous week .
I.E.P. Securities Ltd. , a unit of Mr. Brierley 's Hong Kong-based Industrial Equity ( Pacific ) Ltd. , boosted its holdings in Vickers to 38.8 million shares .
The latest purchase follows small increases in his holdings made over the past five months .
In May , Mr. Brierley 's stake shrank to 8.7 % after ranging between 9 % and 11 % for much of the previous year .
`` Ron Brierley clearly views our company as a good investment , '' a Vickers spokesman said .
The spokesman refused to comment on speculation that Industrial Equity might use its interest as a platform to launch a hostile bid for the company .
Vickers makes tanks for the U.K. army , Rolls Royce cars , and has marine and medical businesses .
Reaching for that extra bit of yield can be a big mistake -- especially if you do n't understand what
you 're investing in .
Just ask Richard Blumenfeld , a New Jersey dentist
who considers himself `` a reasonably sophisticated investor .
In May 1986 , Dr. Blumenfeld gave Merrill Lynch & Co. about $ 40,000 for a federally insured certificate of deposit offering an effective yield of more than 9 % .
`` It was a time when interest rates came down very rapidly , '' Dr. Blumenfeld recalls .
Yields on five-year CDs at major banks were averaging about 7.45 % , and 10-year Treasury notes were paying less than 8 % .
The CD seemed like a great deal .
But nearly 3 1\/2 years later , Merrill says the investment is worth about $ 43,000 -- an amount
that represents an annual return of just over 2 % on Dr. Blumenfeld 's $ 40,000 .
The problem is that the CD
he bought for a retirement plan was n't a plain vanilla CD .
Instead , his Merrill broker put him in a zero-coupon CD , which is sold at a deep discount to its face value .
The difference between the price and the face value payable at maturity is the investor 's return .
More important , the CD was purchased on the secondary , or resale , market .
Because the CD had an effective yield of 13.4 % when it was issued in 1984 , and interest rates in general had declined sharply since then , part of the price Dr. Blumenfeld paid was a premium -- an additional amount on top of the CD 's base value plus accrued interest
that represented the CD 's increased market value .
Now the thrift
that issued the CD is insolvent , and Dr. Blumenfeld has learned to his surprise that the premium is n't insured under federal deposit insurance .
The tip-off came when he opened a recent Merrill Lynch statement and found that the CD 's `` estimated current market value '' had plummeted by $ 9,000 in a month .
Several phone calls and a visit to his broker 's office later , the dentist found out that the $ 9,000 drop represented the current value of the premium
he paid when he bought the CD , and that the amount was n't insured .
`` This is one thing
I was never aware of , '' he says .
He assumed that principal and interest were `` fully insured up to $ 100,000 , '' he adds .
Dr. Blumenfeld is n't unique .
Especially at times like these , when declining rates make it hard for investors to get yields they have come to expect , too many people chase the promise of above-market returns without fully appreciating the risk .
`` Yield greed often gets in the way of understanding things , '' says John Markese , research director of the American Association of Individual Investors , a Chicago-based educational group .
`` The biggest problem
we have is that investors realize , after the fact , that they did n't understand what
they were investing in .
Dr. Blumenfeld concedes he did n't fully understand what
he was buying .
He says that he knew he was getting a zero-coupon CD and that he had previously invested in TIGRs ( Treasury Income Growth Receipts ) , a type of zero-coupon Treasury security sold by Merrill Lynch .
But he says he did n't understand he was buying the CD on the secondary market , and he contends his broker never fully explained the risks .
The broker , Thomas Beairsto of Merrill Lynch 's Morristown , N.J. , office , refuses to discuss the matter with a reporter , referring inquiries to Merrill Lynch officials in New York .
Those officials say there was full disclosure of the risks in a `` fact sheet '' sent to all CD investors with their confirmation of sale .
The fact sheet , dated April 1986 , says on page three : `` If the price paid for a CD purchased in the secondary market ... is higher than the accreted value in the case of zero-coupon CDs , the difference ... is not insured ... .
Computations involving zero-coupon CDs are more complicated and you should discuss any questions you may have with your financial consultant .
Dr. Blumenfeld says he does n't remember the paragraph about premiums in the fact sheet
he received and did n't realize part of what
he paid was a premium .
`` I assumed I was buying a CD as a CD , '' he says .
Nevertheless , Merrill Lynch has agreed that if the thrift
that issued Dr. Blumenfeld 's CD , Peoples Heritage Federal Savings & Loan Association in Salina , Kan. , is liquidated and the CD terminated , the brokerage firm would cover the premium Dr. Blumenfeld paid .
( Federal deposit insurance would pay principal and interest accrued to the date of liquidation , to a maximum of $ 100,000 .
`` It 's not a blanket commitment , it 's a case-by-case situation , '' says Albert Disposti , a managing director of Merrill Lynch Money Markets Inc .
`` There 's a question whether brokers at the time were fully aware '' of the risks .
`` We were n't sure that full disclosure , as we wanted it , was being made .
Merrill Lynch says it 's impossible to estimate how many investors are in Dr. Blumenfeld 's situation , although it says the firm has received only one other complaint about premiums on the secondary market in three years .
Merrill Lynch now provides credit rating information about the institutions whose CDs
it sells , which
it did n't provide in 1986 .
Zero-coupon CDs are only a small portion of the $ 1 trillion-plus in CDs outstanding , and those purchased on the secondary market are an even smaller part of the total .
Merrill Lynch estimates that fewer than 10 financial institutions currently issue zero-coupon CDs .
Still , there are several billion dollars of zero-coupon CDs with various maturities outstanding .
Because of the tax consequences of zero-coupon investments -- income tax is payable in the year interest is accrued , although interest is n't actually paid until maturity -- zero-coupon CDs are usually sold for tax-advantaged accounts to finance things like retirement and children 's education .
Most zero-coupon CDs are in maturities of six to nine years , and they usually double in value by maturity .
But investors
who bought zero-coupon CDs in the secondary market are n't the only ones
who may be surprised to learn the full amount of their investments is n't insured .
People
who paid a premium for standard CDs purchased on the secondary market could also find that those premiums are n't insured if the institutions
that issued the CDs failed .
However , those premiums are usually far smaller than on zero-coupon CDs , and the simpler pricing structure of a standard CD makes it more apparent when a premium is paid .
the case , a Merrill Lynch spokesman emphasizes , investors should n't have to worry about the uninsured premium issue , unless the bank or thrift
that issued the CD is closed and its deposits paid off before maturity or transferred to another institution at a lower rate .
Dr. Blumenfeld says he 's satisfied that his problem has been resolved .
And he says he 's learned a lesson : `` You always have to watch out for yourself .
No one else will watch out for you .
If this battle were a movie , the producers would be fighting over two scripts with nothing but an opening scene in common .
In the opener , Sony Corp. would agree to buy Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. in a transaction valued at close to $ 5 billion .
Shortly after that , Sony would offer to buy Guber-Peters Entertainment Co. for $ 200 million and offer its co-chairmen , Peter Guber and Jon Peters , the chance to run Columbia .
Mr. Peters would fly to New York with the intention of telling Warner Communications Inc. Chairman Steven J. Ross that Guber-Peters planned to end its five-year contract to produce movies exclusively for Warner .
That 's where the two scripts would diverge .
In affidavits filed in Los Angeles Superior Court in connection with the $ 1 billion breach-of-contract suit Warner brought against Sony for hiring the two producers , Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters tell one story .
Warner tells another .
In the affidavits , Mr. Peters says he was `` shocked '' when Mr. Ross refused a meeting and made it clear he would stop them .
Mr. Peters claims he reminded Mr. Ross that Robert Daly and Terry Semel , the top executives of the Warner Brothers studio , had `` repeatedly agreed that we had every right to accept '' an offer such as Sony 's .
In response , Mr. Peters says , Mr. Ross referred to his colleagues at Warner with an `` obscenity '' and said : `` Tell them that they do n't have a job .
You can take them with you .
Warner denies Mr. Ross ever said any such thing , and , in fact , denies virtually everything
Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters say in their affidavits .
Tomorrow , Warner will file another batch of documents contending that `` the essence of everything
these guys are saying is basically lies , '' says Warner 's chief outside counsel , Stuart Rabinowitz .
Thursday , a judge is scheduled to rule on Warner 's motion seeking to block the Guber-Peters duo from going to Columbia .
The battery of legal documents filed in the past week in connection with the suit provide a peek into the inner workings of this Hollywood dogfight .
But they also make it clear that the first thing
a judge will have to decide is which , if any , version of events in this morass is fiction , and which fact .
The matter may never even be tried in court .
Warner says that what
it really wants is for the producers to fulfill their contractual obligations , but the bitterness of this battle and the accusations flying on both
sides make it unlikely that the decade-long relationship between Warner and its two most prolific producers can ever be repaired .
Warner , which is in the process of merging with Time Warner Inc. , says it is willing to settle the matter out of court .
So far , however , Sony has n't been willing to meet its considerable financial demands .
Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters do n't have much to gain from a protracted battle .
Sony , for its part , could decide that the cost of a Warner settlement or court fight is too high , choosing instead to find someone else to run Columbia , although that too would be costly given the financial arrangement already guaranteed to Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters .
In that case , Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters might not suffer financially , but they would be left without their dream job of running a studio and with a considerably scarred relationship with Warner .
At the center of any court fight will be the differing interpretations of the written contract between Warner and the two producers , but other murkier issues will play a big role .
Sony and the Guber-Peters team are hanging much of their case on Warner 's willingness last year to release the producers from another contract and on an oral agreement
they say allowed them to terminate the current written contract if the opportunity to run a major studio came up .
Warner denies such an agreement was made , and disputes the Guber-Peters version of virtually every telephone call and meeting the two sides had on the matter .
Just how rancorous the relationship has become is clear from the differing versions of the two sides ' current business dealings .
Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters say in their affidavits that Warner already is taking steps to freeze them out of their projects at Warner , notably the Sylvester Stallone film `` Tango and Cash .
Mr. Peters says in his affidavit that the movie 's staff was told last week that Warner was `` taking over '' the picture , and another producer would be giving all of the orders .
Over his objections , Mr. Peters says , the film 's release date was moved up `` by many months '' to December , and plans for a soundtrack `` worth millions of dollars '' were dropped .
Hubert de la Bouillaire , an editor on the film , backs Mr. Peters in a separate sworn declaration .
Mr. de la Bouillaire says Warner Brothers production president Mark Canton called him
Oct. 19 and said Mr. Peters is `` off the picture .
If he calls you up , just tell him
everything is fine .
'' The editor also says the new producer on the film , Bruce Baird , told editors to screen the picture without telling stars Sylvester Stallone and Kurt Russell or Mr. Peters .
`` The less
they know , the easier
it is for us .
If someone asks , just lie and tell them
it will be done , '' Mr. de la Bouillaire says Mr. Baird told them .
That , says Warner 's Mr. Rabinowitz , is `` a total 100 % lie .
'' The movie , he says , is in its post-production stages of `` cleaning up the film .
'' He says Mr. Peters and Mr. Guber , as the contractual producers with consultation rights , have been invited to screenings and to give their input on the film .
Dozens of Guber-Peters staffers are still working on the Warner lot and consulting on various projects on a `` daily basis , '' the attorney says .
Mr. Guber , in his affidavit , says that when he advised Warner President Terry Semel of the Sony offer at lunch on Sept. 25 , Mr. Semel `` hugged and congratulated me , and expressed joy that we had finally realized our long-term ambition of running and having an equity position in a major entertainment company .
Mr. Guber says he brought to lunch a release document Warner had agreed to in 1988 , when he and Mr. Peters made an aborted bid to buy part of MGM\/UA Entertainment Co. to run the MGM studio .
Mr. Guber says he had crossed out `` MGM '' with a red pen and written in `` Columbia , '' giving the document to Mr. Semel .
`` Mr. Semel said absolutely nothing to indicate Warner would have any objection to our assuming management positions at Columbia , '' Mr. Guber says .
Mr. Semel , in his affidavit , does n't mention any hugging or congratulating .
He says he told Mr. Guber
he could n't sign any documents and that `` the deal , although apparently a good one for him and Mr. Peters , would have a very negative impact on Warner .
'' He said he would contact Mr. Ross and Warner Brothers Chairman Robert Daly and that , in a conference call , the three agreed they could n't let the producers out of their contract .
Mr. Ross , in his own affidavit , says he and Mr. Daly instructed Mr. Semel to tell the producers Warner would n't terminate their agreement .
Mr. Guber says that Mr. Semel did convey that information and that Mr. Semel said Mr. Ross was `` crazy because of the Time deal , '' meaning , Mr. Guber says , that Mr. Ross `` did not want to communicate to his new merger partner , Time Inc. , that Warner 's agreements provided for our departure under these circumstances .
Mr. Guber also says in his affidavit that Mr. Daly `` told us that even if Sony did not want us , Warner 's relationship with us already was irreparably damaged , that there was no way ` to put the egg together , ' and that it would sue Sony for tons of money .
Moreover , Mr. Guber claims , Mr. Semel told him that Mr. Ross probably would n't object `` if it were anybody other than Sony .
But Sony is a problem .
'' The Guber-Peters side has said Warner is particularly concerned about the prospect of a huge Japanese company controlling important segments of the U.S. entertainment business .
Some in Hollywood suggest Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters took encouragement from Warner studio executives such as Mr. Semel and Mr. Canton too literally .
According to this theory , Warner executives , hoping to strengthen their relationships with the producers , encouraged Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters in their ambitions to build a major entertainment company .
But the Warner executives in their affidavits deny ever telling the producers they could get out of their written contract .
Mr. Rabinowitz , the Warner attorney , says the studio still wants the producers to come back and fulfill their contract .
`` They are like a mini-studio ; they have 50 projects in development for Warner , '' he says .
But Mr. Guber indicates in his affidavit that not all of the projects will be used .
For example , he says that since 1985 , he and Mr. Peters have developed over 85 movie projects , and Warner has `` passed '' or chosen not to produce at least 76 .
As for the projects remaining at Warner , Mr. Guber says , `` Mr. Semel informed me that Warner 's producers have already started a ` feeding frenzy ' for our projects .
Regarding your Oct. 4 page-one article `` Bad Blood '' on the generic-drug battle : The Epilepsy Institute is not just a patient-advocacy organization .
It is primarily a certified outpatient treatment facility providing comprehensive services to people with epilepsy and their families .
The institute 's advocacy efforts are based on the needs of the population
it serves and represents .
In 1985 , the Medical Tribune reported that a growing number of critics are challenging the FDA bioequivalence-therapeutic-equivalence equation .
`` They contend it is based on an assumption
that has not yet been proven in valid tests , '' the Tribune said .
In 1986 , some institute patients were reporting breakthrough seizures when they were switched from a specific brand-name medication to a generic one or from one generic manufacturer of a specific product to another .
In addition , neurologists were beginning to report these observations as well .
Call it anecdotal if you will .
But no ethical physician would switch patients
who were doing well on a specific medication from a specific manufacturer to prove a point .
We do not depend on pharmaceutical companies for our support .
The institute has governmental service contracts for the provision of direct patient services ; collects patient fees ; receives money through contributions from individuals , foundations and bequests .
The funds received from pharmaceutical firms are used to offset physician symposiums , and these symposiums do not stress any particular medication or manufacturer .
The Epilepsy Institute 's reporting of breakthrough seizures stemmed from concerns about the people we treat and care about daily .
This perhaps was perceived as a `` bold '' stance , and thus suspicious .
But let us not confuse profits of big business masquerading as concerns for people 's health care or for the cost .
For whom is the saving ?
Surely not to people with epilepsy
who depend on the same levels of medication in their bloodstream daily to maintain seizure control .

Pacific Telesis Group said its Pacific Bell unit sustained property damage of about $ 45 million to $ 50 million from the California earthquake earlier this month .
The San Francisco-based telecommunications company said it carries $ 150 million of earthquake insurance with a $ 10 million deductible provision .
Sam Ginn , chairman and chief executive officer , told securities analysts in New York that the company expects somewhat slower per-share earnings growth in 1990 , although annual growth should return to the traditional figure of about 7 % thereafter .
As factors contributing to the temporary slowdown , he cited one-time rate reductions prescribed by California regulators as a prelude to a new framework
that removes profit constraints .
He also mentioned increased capital investment by Pacific Bell for network improvements .
Mr. Ginn said the company 's cellular operations now serve about 341,000 customers , up 46 % from a year ago .
Beauty Takes Backseat
To Safety on Bridges
EVERYONE AGREES that most of the nation 's old bridges need to be repaired or replaced .
But there 's disagreement over how to do it .
Highway officials insist the ornamental railings on older bridges are n't strong enough to prevent vehicles from crashing through .
But other people do n't want to lose the bridges ' beautiful , sometimes historic , features .
`` The primary purpose of a railing is to contain a vehicle and not to provide a scenic view , '' says Jack White , a planner with the Indiana Highway Department .
He and others prefer to install railings such as the `` type F safety shape , '' a four-foot-high concrete slab with no openings .
In Richmond , Ind. , the type F railing is being used to replace arched openings on the G Street Bridge .
Garret Boone , who teaches art at Earlham College , calls the new structure `` just an ugly bridge '' and one
that blocks the view of a new park below .
In Hartford , Conn. , the Charter Oak Bridge will soon be replaced , the cast-iron medallions from its railings relegated to a park .
Compromises are possible .
Citizens in Peninsula , Ohio , upset over changes to a bridge , negotiated a deal : The bottom half of the railing will be type F , while the top half will have the old bridge 's floral pattern .
Similarly , highway engineers agreed to keep the old railings on the Key Bridge in Washington , D.C. , as long as they could install a crash barrier between the sidewalk and the road .
Tray Bon ?
Drink Carrier
Competes With Cartons
PORTING POTABLES just got easier , or so claims Scypher Corp. , the maker of the Cup-Tote .
The Chicago company 's beverage carrier , meant to replace cardboard trays at concession stands and fast-food outlets , resembles the plastic loops used on six-packs of beer , only the loops hang from a web of strings .
The new carrier can tote as many as four cups at once .
Inventor Claire Marvin says his design virtually eliminates spilling .
Lids are n't even needed .
He also claims the carrier costs less and takes up less space than most paper carriers .
A few fast-food outlets are giving it
a try .
The company acknowledges some problems .
A driver has to find something to hang the carrier on , so the company supplies a window hook .
While it breaks down in prolonged sunlight , it is n't recyclable .
And unlike some trays , there 's no place for food .
Spirit of Perestroika
Touches Design World
AN EXCHANGE of U.S. and Soviet designers promises change on both
sides .
An exhibition of American design and architecture opened in September in Moscow and will travel to eight other Soviet cities .
The show runs the gamut , from a blender to chairs to a model of the Citicorp building .
The event continues into next year and includes an exchange program to swap design teachers at Carnegie-Mellon and Leningrad 's Mutchin Institute .
Dan Droz , leader of the Carnegie-Mellon group , sees benefits all around .
The Soviets , who normally have few clients other than the state , will get `` exposure to a market system , '' he says .
Americans will learn more about making products for the Soviets .
Mr. Droz says the Soviets could even help U.S. designers renew their sense of purpose .
`` In Moscow , they kept asking us things like , ` Why do you make 15 different corkscrews , when all
you need is one
good one ?
' '' he says .
`` They got us thinking maybe we should be helping U.S. companies improve existing products rather than always developing new ones .
Seed for Jail Solution
Fails to Take Root
IT 'S A TWO BIRDS with one stone deal : Eggers Group architects propose using grain elevators to house prisoners .
It would ease jail overcrowding while preserving historic structures , the company says .
But New York state , which is seeking solutions to its prison cell shortage , says `` no .
Grain elevators built in the 1920s and '30s have six-inch concrete walls and a tubular shape
that would easily contain semicircular cells with a control point in the middle , the New York firm says .
Many are far enough from residential areas to pass public muster , yet close enough to permit family visits .
Besides , Eggers says , grain elevators are worth preserving for aesthetic reasons -- one famed architect compared them to the pyramids of Egypt .
A number of cities -- including Minneapolis , Philadelphia and Houston -- have vacant grain elevators , Eggers says .
A medium-sized one in Brooklyn , it says , could be altered to house up to 1,000 inmates at a lower cost than building a new prison in upstate New York .
A spokesman for the state , however , calls the idea `` not effective or cost efficient .
Ramada Inc. revised the terms of its restructuring and extended to Feb. 28 , 1990 , the deadline to complete the sale of its hotel business to New World Development Co. of Hong Kong and Prime Motor Inns Inc. of Fairfield , N.J .
Ramada 's previous plan was derailed by upheaval in the junk-bond market
that hindered the offering of $ 400 million in high-yield securities of Aztar Corp. , the new company
that will operate Ramada 's casinos in Nevada and Atlantic City ,
Under the new terms , New World will still pay $ 540 million for Ramada 's hotel business , subject to adjustment at closing , but Ramada will now reimburse New World for $ 10 million in expenses .
Prime will still manage Ramada 's domestic franchise system when the sale closes .
Revised terms call for each Ramada common share to be exchanged for $ 1 in cash , subject to possible reduction , and one share of Aztar common stock .
Shareholders will also receive one cent per share for the redemption of preferred stock purchase rights .
The cash payout will be reduced by 40 % of any amount by which
the weighted mean price of Ramada 's common stock exceeds $ 14 on the day
the transaction closes .
The provision will help provide for tax liabilities
that may stem from the restructuring .
Ramada 's stock rose 87.5 cents on the news to close at $ 11.25 in composite New York Stock Exchange trading .
The announcement dispelled some Wall Street observers ' fears that New World might demand a huge premium for the delay , or scrap the deal entirely .
The previous deadline to complete the sale was Nov. 30 .
One major advantage of the revised plan is that Aztar will have far less debt than under the old terms .
`` They 'll go from being one of the most leveraged to one of the least leveraged casino companies , '' said Daniel Lee , an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc .
Mr. Lee values the package at between $ 15 and $ 20
a share , based on current trading prices of other casino-company stocks .
The much-revised restructuring , which was first announced in October 1988 , must again be approved by shareholders and state casino regulators in Nevada and New Jersey .
Financing plans include raising $ 170 million in debt secured by the company 's holdings in New Jersey .
In May , Ramada sold its Marie Callender Pie Shops Inc. unit to a group of private investors as part of its plan to focus on its casinos in Atlantic City and in Las Vegas and Laughlin , Nev .
Nixdorf Computer AG , citing continued profitability problems , said it will have to reduce personnel further , notably in research and development sectors .
The troubled West German computer company said , in a statement to its employees , that the number of persons working in product development will be reduced world-wide to 2,440 from 2,888 by the end of 1990 .
The number of workers in production sectors will be cut by 488 , to 5,200 by September .
The cuts will be made half within Germany and half abroad .
In the first nine months of 1989 , Nixdorf said , sales rose 5 % amid good growth in selected areas such as banks and trading companies .
The company also cited some success in damping cost increases and said it wants to return to profitability in 1990 .
It cited the expected beneficial effects of a concentration on key products , further structural changes within the group and cooperation agreements with other companies .
Eight people , including a supervisor of Security Pacific National Bank 's central vault , were arrested in an investigation of an alleged drug money-laundering operation .
The U.S. Attorney 's office filed a criminal complaint against six bank employees charging them with conspiracy in the scheme , which apparently was capable of handling millions of dollars
a week by funneling cash through fictitious bank accounts .
Two other men also were charged with participating in the operation .
The arrests capped a four-month investigation by the Internal Revenue Service , the U.S. Attorney 's office and a Security Pacific internal investigation team .
Walter S. Fisher , executive vice president and general auditor of the bank 's parent , Security Pacific Corp. , said no bank funds were at risk during the investigation .
Arrested were Jose O. Lopez , 27 years old , of Whittier , Calif. , the vault supervisor ; Carlos O. Huerta , 29 , of La Puente ; Luis A. Arroyo , 36 , of Los Angeles ; Ignacio Rojas Jr. , 32 , of Baldwin Park ; Doris Moreno , 37 , of Bell Gardens ; and Ana L. Azucena , 27 , of Huntington Park .
Geno M. Apicella , 27 , of Los Angeles , and Terrell N. Madison , 27 , of Hawthorne , were also charged with participating in the conspiracy .
Each defendant faces a possible sentence of 20 years in prison and $ 250,000 in fines .
The defendants could n't immediately be reached for comment .
Prince , the rock star , is indecent , according to the Federal Communications Comission .
At least before 8 p.m .
The FCC proposed to fine KLUC-FM , in Las Vegas , $ 2,000 for playing the Prince song `` Erotic City '' on May 16 , 1988 , at 7:53 p.m. because the song is allegedly indecent .
By FCC standards , that means the song uses `` patently offensive '' terms to describe `` sexual or excretory activities or organs .
`` Erotic City , '' which was released as a single in 1984 and sold 250,000 copies , is certainly hot -- too hot for this newspaper to reproduce the lyrics .
Suffice it to say , the song uses a short word for sexual congress , and congress is in session
a lot during the song .
An agent for Prince did n't return a telephone call seeking comment .
And KLUC , a part of Nationwide Communications Inc. , could n't be reached .
The Las Vegas telephone directory only lists KLUC 's `` Concert Hot Line '' -- and no one answered the Hot Line at midday yesterday .
But the proposed fine is bound to be controversial .
For one thing , the FCC dismissed 51 complaints about indecency because the programs aired material after 8 p.m. -- only seven minutes after KLUC played `` Erotic City .
'' The FCC now says 8 p.m. is the time
that is all right to begin airing indecent material because children are n't likely listening in great numbers .
Earlier , the agency set the decency line at midnight , but an appeals court rejected that time as too restrictive .
`` You have to draw some lines , '' said Robert Pettit , the FCC 's general counsel .
Tom Chiusano , vice president and general manager of WXRK-FM in New York , said the FCC decision singling out KLUC seemed unfair because he estimated probably 500 radio stations have played `` Erotic City .
'' But Mr. Chiusano has his own problems .
The FCC also sent WXRK
a letter saying it believed one of its shows , the Howard Stern Show , contained indecent material .
The agency has n't yet proposed a fine for WXRK .
But two years ago , when the agency began its crackdown on indecency , Mr. Stern 's show , which features a lot of gross jokes , was one of the shows cited in the agency 's first warning letters to broadcasters .
`` Howard Stern does n't broadcast indecent material , '' said Mr. Chiusano .
`` He does four hours of contemporaneous humor .
So far the indecency crackdown has managed to offend both civil libertarians , who say the FCC has gone too far , and Congress , which says the FCC has n't gone far enough .
Meanwhile the courts have rejected most of the FCC 's plans , and the agency has been subject to constant ridicule .
One commissioner even proposed banning a reading of James Joyce 's `` Ulysses '' until cooler heads prevailed .
But the agency has n't given up .
In addition to citing the stations in New York and Las Vegas , the FCC proposed fining radio stations in Miami and Los Angeles for airing
allegedly indecent material before 8 p.m .
In addition , the agency said it would begin a proceeding to see whether it was possible to find legal grounds for a ban on indecent programming around the clock .
Concord Camera Corp. completed the acquisition of Peter Bauser G.m.b .
H. , a West German photographic products distributor .
Concord is a camera and photographic products company .
Nashua Corp. , rumored a potential takeover target for six months , said that a Dutch company has sought U.S. approval to buy up to 25 % of Nashua 's shares .
Nashua immediately responded by strengthening a poison-pill plan and saying it will buy back up to one million of its shares , or 10.4 % of the 9.6 million outstanding .
Nashua , whose major business is selling copiers , facsimile machines and related supplies , said Reiss & Co .
B.V. of the Netherlands filed a request with the Federal Trade Commission under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act for permission to buy more than $ 15 million of Nashua 's stock but less than 25 % .
Previously , an affiliate of Unicorp Canada disclosed a stake of less than 5 % in Nashua , according to Daniel M. Junius , Nashua 's treasurer .
Nashua 's stock has fluctuated sharply on takeover speculation , rising to a high for the year of $ 42.875
a share in June from $ 29.75 in March .
But the company has had weak results so far this year , with earnings declining 43 % to $ 13.7 million , or $ 1.43
a share , on a 4 % decline in revenue to $ 713.5 million through the first nine months of the year .
Its stock has slumped recently , closing unchanged Friday at $ 29
a share in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange ; at that price , the company has a market value of about $ 278.4 million .
Nashua announced the Reiss request after the market closed .
Mr. Junius said Nashua 's `` intention is to remain an independent public company .
'' The company said it amended its shareholder rights plan by reducing to 10 % from 20 %
the level of ownership by an outsider
that would trigger the issuance to other holders of rights to buy additional shares of Nashua common at half price .
In addition , the company 's board authorized the purchase of up to an additional one million shares .
Under a program approved by the company in 1987
that did n't specify a share amount , Nashua had purchased 481,000 shares through Sept. 29 .
Alex Henderson , an analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities , said that while Nashua 's performance
this year has been `` atrocious , '' the company nonetheless is attractive as a `` classic breakup candidate because there 's no similarity between its { four } businesses .
'' He estimated the breakup value at $ 55
In addition to selling Japanese-made photocopiers and facsimile machines in Europe and copier supplies in the U.S. , Nashua has three other major businesses : labels and tapes , data storage disks for computers and mail-order photofinishing .
Your Oct. 2 page-one article on people riding so-called `` railbikes '' on railroad tracks was a disservice to your readers .
It unfortunately encourages others to engage in a highly dangerous and illegal activity that only a very few are doing now .
And it treats such activities in a frivolous , cavalier fashion , with total indifference to common sense and public safety .

Big gains for the ultra-right Republicans party in Baden-Wuerttemburg state municipal elections Sunday showed eroding support for Chancellor Helmut Kohl in a traditional bastion for his Christian Democratic Union .
With ballots from most of the state 's major cities in by yesterday morning , the Republicans came away with 10 % of the vote in several of the key districts .
With many rural districts yet to report ballots , election officials estimate support for Christian Democrats fell an average five percentage points statewide .
The left-of-center Social Democrats and the environmental Greens party posted mixed results .
Headed by a former Waffen SS sergeant and working from a nationalistic platform of anti-foreigner rhetoric , the fledgling Republicans party has scored surprising gains in earlier elections in the states of West Berlin , Hesse and North-Rhine Westphalia .
With West German unemployment remaining high at two million jobless and the lack of affordable housing becoming a primary issue for next year 's campaign , the Republicans are seen drawing support for their `` Germans First '' stand on social-welfare issues .
Election analysts acknowledge that a `` Red-Green '' coalition of Social Democrats and Greens could edge out Chancellor Kohl 's coalition in the December 1990 national election if support for the Republicans continues to spread .
International investigators urged Britain to allow prosecution of suspected Nazi war criminals
who took refuge there after 1945 .
Under current law , such suspects are immune from prosecution for acts committed while not British citizens .
`` If we 're not careful we could become known as a haven for war criminals , '' said Jeff Rooker , a member of Parliament and one of several British politicians attending a London conference with government investigators from the U.S. , Canada and Australia .
A parliamentary inquiry found in July that more than 70 people living in Britain could have been part of death squads
that roamed Nazi-occupied Eastern Europe .
Parliament is expected to discuss next month whether to change the law .
British investigations were prompted by a list of 17 alleged war criminals living in Britain sent to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in October 1986 by the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles .
In a sign of easing tension between Beijing and Hong Kong , China said it will again take back illegal immigrants caught crossing into the British colony .
China had refused to repatriate citizens
who sneaked into Hong Kong illegally since early this month , when the colony allowed a dissident Chinese swimmer to flee to the U.S .
About 1,100 Chinese were awaiting repatriation yesterday .
Italy 's Foreign Ministry said it is investigating exports to the Soviet Union by an Ing .
C. Olivetti & Co. subsidiary called OCN-PPL that makes numerically controlled machine tools .
Although Italy 's investigation of whether Olivetti had violated Western export-control rules had previously been made known , this marked the first time
the unit and product were named .
The U.S. is worried about the convertibility of Olivetti 's machine tools to military use .
However , an Olivetti spokeswoman said OCN-PPL , of which
Olivetti sold the majority interest last year , `` does n't make equipment
that has the type of precision necessary for sophisticated productions .
Conservationists say that drift-net fishing threatens to wipe out much of the world 's tuna stocks in a few years .
But the Japanese Fisheries Association criticized moves to ban the practice in international waters .
`` It is really unfortunate for human beings to be swayed by emotional discussions , '' the association said .
In driftnet , or `` wall of death , '' fishing , fleets lay nets up to three miles long that trap almost everything in their path .
Earlier this year , Japan said it would cut the number of its drift-net vessels in the South Pacific by two-thirds , or down to 20 .
Workers at Peugeot S.A. 's car plant at Sochaux , in eastern France , voted to end a six-week-old strike
that has cost the Peugeot group production of 60,000 automobiles , a company spokesman said .
The strikers voted to accept a series of management proposals
that will give them
a higher basic wage , better profit-sharing benefits and bigger annual bonuses .
The spokesman said the vote at Sochaux is expected to be followed by a similar move at the company 's assembly plant at Mulhouse , where the number of strikers has been whittled down to 80 .
About 8,000 National Union of Mineworkers members resumed their strike against De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd. after further negotiations to settle a wage dispute broke down .
Striking workers , who began striking five diamond mines on Oct. 13 , had returned to work last week when the union and De Beers arranged to reopen negotiations .
A De Beers spokesman said yesterday the company had offered to increase the minimum wage by 18 % , while the union was demanding 26.6 % .
Before the two parties resumed talks last week , De Beers offered 17 % and the union wanted 37.6 % .
China 's People 's Daily took note of the growing problem of computer fraud .
Since the first fraud was discovered in July 1986 at an office of the People 's Bank of China in Shenzhen , 15 major cases have been found , the paper said ; the biggest was the theft of $ 235,000 from a bank in Chengdu in March 1988 .
The number of computers has mushroomed in recent years , with 10,000 in use , as well as 30,000 miniature models .
But security systems , effective management controls and regulations to govern their use have not kept pace , the People 's Daily said .
Besides money , criminals have also used computers to steal secrets and intelligence , the newspaper said , but it gave no more details .
Japanese tourists will be told to take care when photographing earthquake damage in San Francisco , the Japan Association of Travel Agents said .
The association issued an advisory to its 1,685 member agencies following a report from the Foreign Ministry that picture-taking by Japanese tourists in earthquake-stricken areas was causing ill feeling among local residents ... .

Boeing Co. 's third-quarter profit leaped 68 % , but Wall Street 's attention was focused on the picket line , not the bottom line .
In fact , the earnings report unfolded as representatives of the world 's No. 1 jet maker and the striking Machinists union came back to the negotiating table for their first meeting in two weeks .
Doug Hammond , the federal mediator in Seattle , where Boeing is based , said the parties will continue to sit down daily until a new settlement proposal emerges or the talks break off again .
Despite the progress , Boeing indicated that the work stoppage , now in its 27th day , will have `` a serious adverse impact '' on the current quarter .
For the third quarter , net rose to $ 242 million , or $ 1.05
a share , from $ 144 million , or 63 cents
Sales climbed 71 % to $ 6.36 billion from $ 3.72 billion as the company capitalized on the ravenous global demand for commercial airliners .
Because it 's impossible to gauge how long the walkout by 55,000 Machinists rank and file will last , the precise impact on Boeing 's sales , earnings , cash flow and short-term investment position could n't be determined .
The investment community , however , strongly believes that the strike will be settled before there is any lasting effect on either Boeing or its work force .
The company 's total firm backlog of unfilled orders at Sept. 30 stood at a mighty $ 69.1 billion , compared with $ 53.6 billion at the end of
Although the company could see fourth-quarter revenue shrink by nearly $ 5 billion if it is n't able to deliver any more planes
this year , those dollars actually would just be deferred until 1990 .
And the company is certain to get out some aircraft with just supervisors and other non-striking employees on hand .
Before the union rejected the company 's offer and the strike was launched with the graveyard shift of Oct. 4 , Boeing had been counting on turning 96 aircraft out the door in the present period .
That included 21 of the company 's 747-400 jumbo jets , its most successful product .
`` It 's not a pretty picture , '' said David Smith , an analyst with Raymond James & Associates .
`` But it would just mean a great first and second quarter next year .
Phillip Brannon of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets added : `` You do n't want to minimize this and say nobody is looking at it .
But the strike has n't gone on long enough for Boeing to lose business in any real sense .
That 's the primary reason
the company 's share price has held up so well when , in Mr. Smith 's words , `` most companies would have unraveled '' by now .
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading , Boeing closed yesterday at $ 54.50
a share , off a scant 12.5 cents .
Still , Boeing went through its normal verbal gymnastics and played up the downside .
In a statement , Chairman Frank Shrontz asserted that the company `` faces significant challenges and risks , '' on both its commercial and government contracts .
For instance , he noted that spending on Pentagon programs is shrinking , and Boeing is either the prime contractor or a major supplier on many important military projects , including the B-2 Stealth bomber , the V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft and the Air Force 's next-generation tactical fighter .
Because of cost overruns on fixed-price military work , Mr. Shrontz said , the company 's defense business will record `` a significant loss '' in 1989 .
Moreover , Mr. Shrontz added , production-rate increases
that have been implemented on the 737 , 747 , 757 and 767 programs have resulted in `` serious work force skill-dilution problems .
'' Suppliers and subcontractors are experiencing heightened pressure to support delivery schedules .
And , of course , there 's the unsteady labor situation .
Besides the Machinists pact , accords representing 30,000 of the company 's engineering and technical employees in the Puget Sound and Wichita , Kan. , areas expire in early December .
Also , a contract with the United Auto Workers at the company 's helicopter plant in Philadelphia expired Oct. 15 .
This contract , covering about 3,000 hourly production and maintenance workers , is being extended on a day-to-day basis .
The Machinists rejected a proposal featuring a 10 % base wage increase over the life of the three-year contract , plus bonuses of 8 %
the first year and 3 %
the second .
On top of that , Boeing would make cost-of-living adjustments projected to be 5 % for each year of the contract .
The union , though , has called the offer `` insulting .
'' The company reiterated yesterday that it 's willing to reconfigure
the package , but not add to the substance of it .
For the nine months , Boeing 's net increased 36 % to $ 598 million , or $ 2.60
a share , from $ 440 million , or $ 1.92
Sales soared 28 % to $ 15.43 billion from $ 12.09 billion .
In a separate matter , the Justice Department yesterday said Boeing agreed to pay the government $ 11 million to settle claims that the company provided inaccurate cost information to the Air Force while negotiating contracts to replace the aluminum skins on the KC-135 tanker aircraft .
The settlement relates to four contracts negotiated from 1982 to 1985 , prosecutors said .
They added that the settlement is the culmination of a 2 1\/2-year investigation into the company 's aluminum pricing practices in connection with KC-135s .
A Boeing spokesman responded : `` All along the company has said there was no grounds for criminal prosecution .
That was borne out by the Justice Department 's decision '' to settle the case .

McDonnell Douglas Corp. received contracts totaling $ 244.8 million for 72 F-A-18 aircraft for the Navy and helicopter spare parts for the Army .
Aerojet General Corp. , a unit of GenCorp Inc. , was awarded a $ 40.1 million Air Force contract for Minuteman missile rocket motors .
Rockwell International Corp. received a $ 26.7 million Navy contract for submarine ballistic missiles .
Honeywell Inc. got a $ 22.3 million Navy contract for aircraft missile warning sets .
Beech Aircraft Corp. , a unit of Raytheon Co. , received an $ 11.5 million Air Force contract for C-12 aircraft support .
Yields on money-market mutual funds continued to slide , amid signs that portfolio managers expect further declines in interest rates .
The average seven-day compound yield of the 400 taxable funds tracked by IBC 's Money Fund Report eased a fraction of a percentage point to 8.45 % from 8.47 % for the week ended Tuesday .
Compound yields assume reinvestment of dividends and that the current yield continues for a year .
Average maturity of the funds ' investments lengthened by a day to 41 days , the longest since early August , according to Donoghue 's .
Longer maturities are thought to indicate declining interest rates because they permit portfolio managers to retain relatively higher rates for a longer period .
Shorter maturities are considered a sign of rising rates because portfolio managers can capture higher rates sooner .
The average maturity for funds open only to institutions , considered by some to be a stronger indicator because those managers watch the market closely , reached a high point for the year -- 33 days .
Nevertheless , said Brenda Malizia Negus , editor of Money Fund Report , yields `` may blip up again before they
blip down '' because of recent rises in short-term interest rates .
The yield on six-month Treasury bills sold at Monday 's auction , for example , rose to 8.04 % from 7.90 % .
Despite recent declines in yields , investors continue to pour cash into money funds .
Assets of the 400 taxable funds grew by $ 1.5 billion during the latest week , to $ 352.7 billion .
Typically , money-fund yields beat comparable short-term investments because portfolio managers can vary maturities and go after the highest rates .
The top money funds are currently yielding well over 9 % .
Dreyfus World-Wide Dollar , the top-yielding fund , had a seven-day compound yield of 9.37 % during the latest week , down from 9.45 %
It invests heavily in dollar-denominated securities overseas and is currently waiving management fees , which boosts its yield .
The average seven-day simple yield of the 400 funds was 8.12 % , down from 8.14 % .
The 30-day simple yield fell to an average 8.19 % from 8.22 % ; the 30-day compound yield slid to an average 8.53 % from 8.56 % .

The debentures mature Oct. 27 , 1999 .
The debentures will be available in book-entry form only in a minimum amount of $ 5,000 and additional increments of $ 5,000 .

The dollar finished lower yesterday , after tracking another rollercoaster session on Wall Street .
Concern about the volatile U.S. stock market had faded in recent sessions , and traders appeared content to let the dollar languish in a narrow range until tomorrow , when the preliminary report on third-quarter U.S. gross national product is released .
But seesaw gyrations in the Dow Jones Industrial Average yesterday put Wall Street back in the spotlight and inspired market participants to bid the U.S. unit lower .
UAL 's decision to remain an independent company sent share prices tumbling .
By midmorning , the DJIA had plunged 80 points and foreign-exchange dealers quickly drove the dollar down .
When the DJIA modestly rebounded , the dollar bounced back in choppy dealings but ended the day below the levels of late Monday .
Stock prices , meanwhile , posted significant gains in later trading and closed down by only 3.69 points on the day .
Some dealers said that the market 's strong reaction to Wall Street reflects a general uneasiness about the dollar .
They added that the DJIA 's swift drop proved an easy excuse for the market to drive the U.S. currency in the direction
it was already headed .
In late New York trading yesterday , the dollar was quoted at 1.8355 marks , down from 1.8470 marks Monday , and at 141.45 yen , down from 141.90 yen late Monday .
Sterling was quoted at $ 1.6055 , up from $ 1.6030 late Monday .
In Tokyo Wednesday , the U.S. currency opened for trading at 141.57 yen , down from Tuesday 's Tokyo close of 142.10 yen .
Tom Trettien , a vice president with Banque Paribas in New York , sees a break in the dollar 's long-term upward trend , a trend
that began in January 1988 .
He argues that the dollar is now `` moving sideways , '' adding that `` the next leg could be the beginning of a longer term bearish phase .
Analysts peg the dollar 's recent weakness to an underlying slowdown in the U.S. economy , highlighted by recent economic data , particularly a surprisingly sharp widening in the August U.S. trade gap .
They also point out that narrowing interest-rate differentials between the U.S. and its major trading partners tend to make the U.S. currency less attractive to foreign investors .
Despite several spurts of dollar trading , it was noted that mark-yen cross trade grabbed much of the market 's attention .
Following the dive in U.S. stocks , the mark has strengthened more than its major counterparts .
Traders attribute the mark 's surge to a robust West German economy and higher rate differentials .
But , they add that the mark 's strength is in part
a reflection of a shift away from U.S. assets by Japanese investors into West German investments .
`` The question remains : how much can the West German market absorb ? '' says one senior dealer .
Some dealers say that Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita 's reassurance that Japanese monetary policy wo n't be changed for the time being has given investors
an added excuse to push the yen down even further against the mark .
Despite the yen 's weakness with respect to the mark , Tokyo traders say they do n't expect the Bank of Japan to take any action to support the Japanese currency on that front .
Meanwhile , sterling slumped on news that the United Kingdom posted a wider-than-expected trade deficit in September .
The news also knocked the British unit to below 2.95 marks in London , but a bout of short-covering helped sterling recoup some of its earlier losses .

Courtaulds PLC announced plans to spin off its textiles operations to existing shareholders in a restructuring to boost shareholder value .
The British chemical and textile company 's plan , which requires shareholder approval , would create a new , listed U.K. stock with a probable market capitalization between # 300 million ( $ 473 million ) and # 400 million , analysts said .
The establishment of the separate company , to be called Courtaulds Textiles , could be effective as early as next year 's first quarter .
Investors welcomed the move .
Courtaulds ' shares rose 15 pence to 362 pence , valuing the entire company at about # 1.44 billion .
Courtaulds ' spinoff reflects pressure on British industry to boost share prices beyond the reach of corporate raiders .
Courtaulds ' restructuring is among the largest thus far in Britain , though it is dwarfed by B.A.T Industries PLC 's plans to spin off roughly # 4 billion in assets to help fend off a takeover bid from Anglo-French financier Sir James Goldsmith .
The divested Courtaulds textile operations had operating profit of # 50 million on # 980 million in revenue in the year ended March 31 .
Some analysts have said Courtaulds ' moves could boost the company 's value by 5 % to 10 % , because the two entities separately will carry a higher price earnings multiple than they did combined .
In addition , Courtaulds said the moves are logical because they will allow both
the chemicals and textile businesses to focus more closely on core activities .
Courtaulds has been under pressure to enhance shareholder value since takeover speculators -- including Australian financier Kerry Packer -- surfaced holding small stakes last year .
Though Mr. Packer has since sold his stake , Courtaulds is moving to keep its institutional shareholders happy .
Even without a specific takeover threat , Courtaulds is giving shareholders `` choice and value , '' said Julia Blake , an analyst at London stockbrokers Barclays de Zoete Wedd .
In a statement , the company said : `` Both
parts can only realize their full potential and be appropriately valued by the market if they are separately quoted companies .
The sharper definition and the autonomy
which
each will thereby gain will benefit shareholders , customers and employees .
Courtaulds Chairman and Chief Executive Sir Christopher Hogg will remain in both
posts at the surviving chemical company after the spinoff .
House and Senate conferees agreed to continue production of Grumman Corp. 's F-14 and to provide more than $ 3.8 billion for the Strategic Defense Initiative during the current fiscal year .
Industry officials and congressional aides said that the main points of a compromise defense authorization bill , hammered out during a flurry of private meetings over the past few days , provide a face-saving compromise for both
the White House and House Democrats .
Although conferees are still putting the finishing touches on the package , the final agreement could be announced as early as tomorrow .
An announcement is more likely next week , though .
President Bush and other supporters of SDI will be able to take credit for blocking House efforts to significantly cut the program to develop a space-based antimissile system , which already has cost some $ 17 billion .
Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn ( D. , Ga .
) and other Senate conferees have opposed the House cuts , stalling for almost two months action on a number of big-ticket items in the Pentagon 's budget .
The Senate voted to authorize $ 4.5 billion for SDI spending in the current fiscal year , but the House , reflecting a dramatic erosion of support for the program , earmarked only $ 3.1 billion .
Despite the widening gap between the two sides , conferees eventually followed the pattern set in previous years by opting to roughly split the difference .
That would hold spending on the program at about the previous year 's level .
The decision to keep the embattled F-14 's production line running for at least
another year is an important victory for the House , and especially for Rep. Les Aspin ( D. , Wis .
) .
As the head of the House conferees , Rep. Aspin has been under intense pressure from his colleagues to reject Senate provisions
that would have abruptly cut further F-14 production .
The package `` provides a temporary , golden parachute for Grumman , '' according to one congressional aide familiar with the closed-door bargaining .
But as part of the overall agreement , Grumman and its outspoken supporters on Capitol Hill effectively will be precluded from reopening the emotional issue in the debate over next year 's budget .
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and most senators contend that the Navy 's F-14 is too expensive in an era of shrinking Pentagon budgets .
But the plane boasts a strong core of support in the House , where members are intent on saving Grumman jobs and are worried about potential shortages of carrier-based aircraft by the late 1990s .
Conferees also agreed to Pentagon requests to earmark a total of nearly $ 1 billion for work on both mobile MX and Midgetman nuclear missiles , according to congressional aides .
And lawmakers are putting the finishing touches on a compromise
that would give the Air Force nearly all of the $ 2.4 billion it wants for production of Northrop Corp. 's radar-eluding B-2 bombers , which cost $ 530 million apiece .
The final B-2 agreement is certain to require detailed testing and verification of the bomber 's capabilities , but congressional aides said the accord wo n't include a House-passed provision
that would have withheld production funds until Congress approves a cheaper , scaled-down version of the $ 70 billion fleet of 132 B-2s envisioned by the Pentagon .
As Yogi Berra might say , it 's deja vu
all over again .
Crouched at shortstop , Bert Campaneris , once Oakland 's master thief , effortlessly scoops up a groundball and flips it to second .
In the outfield , Paul Blair , the Orioles ' eight-time Gold Glove winner , elegantly shags a fly .
On the mound , former Red Sox great Luis Tiant , the wily master of 1,001 moves , throws an off-speed strike .
`` Babies , kiddies , '' growls their manager -- a fellow named Earl Weaver , who , in a different time , handled four World Series teams and now handles the Gold Coast Suns .
`` Old-time kiddies , '' he says .
Perhaps .
But for the next few months , these boys of summers long past are going to be reveling in an Indian summer of the soul .
Now that the baseball season is officially over , you see , it 's time for a new season to begin .
Today is the debut of the Senior Professional Baseball Association , a new eight-team pro sports circuit , modeled after the highly successful senior tennis and golf tours and complete with good salaries , a cable television contract and even expansion plans .
One hundred and ninety two former greats , near greats , hardly knowns and unknowns begin a 72-game , three-month season in spring-training stadiums up and down Florida .
For everyone involved , it 's one
more swig of that elixir of youth , baseball .
`` Someone always makes you quit , '' says legendary St. Louis Cardinals centerfielder Curt Flood , the league 's commissioner .
`` You feel you want one more -- one more at-bat , one more hit , one
more game .
Until the baby-faced heroes of today reclaim these ballparks for spring training , there is one more .
And not just for the players .
It
's
one more for the baseball-loving lawyers , accountants and real estate developers
who ponied up about $ 1 million each for the chance to be an owner , to step into the shoes of a Gene Autry or have a beer with Rollie Fingers .
`` Nothing can be better than this , '' says Don Sider , owner of the West Palm Beach Tropics .
Early in the morning Mr. Sider , an estate lawyer , pores over last wills and testaments .
Midmorning , he dons an orange-and-blue uniform and , for fun , may field a bunt from Dave Kingman .
one more , too , for the fans
who dream of a season
that never ends .
`` I feel like a little kid , '' says a gleeful Alex de Castro , a car salesman , who has stopped by a workout of the Suns to slip six Campaneris cards to the Great Man
Himself to be autographed .
The league 's promoters hope retirees and tourists will join die-hard fans like Mr. de Castro and pack the stands to see the seniors .
The league is the brainchild of Colorado real estate developer James Morley -- once a minor-leaguer
himself -- who says he had the idea last January while lying on a beach in Australia .
When he sent letters offering 1,250 retired major leaguers
the chance of another season , 730 responded .
Eventually , about 250 made the trip to Florida to compete for the available slots .
( Players have to be 35 or older , except for catchers , who are eligible at 32 because life behind the plate is so rough .
For some players , the lure is money -- up to $ 15,000
a month .
Others , just released from the majors , hope the senior league will be their bridge back into the big-time .
But as they hurl fireballs
that smolder rather than burn , and relive old duels in the sun , it 's clear that most are there to make their fans cheer again or recapture the camaraderie of seasons past or prove to themselves and their colleagues that they still have it -- or something close to it .
`` My fastball is good .
Real good , '' says 39-year-old Pete Broberg , working in the midday heat of the Tropics camp .
Mr. Broberg , who started with the now-defunct Washington Senators , says that when he left baseball in 1978 , he `` never looked back .
'' For a long time , he ignored baseball altogether , even the sports pages .
Now Mr. Broberg , a lawyer , claims he 'd play for free .
`` You ca n't give it up that easily , '' he says .
`` I tried .
The nagging memory of one afternoon fourteen years ago drove Jim Gideon , a lean 36-year-old righthander to take a four-month leave from selling insurance in Texas to try out for Mr. Weaver 's team .
`` It does n't replace pitching in the majors , but it proves to me that I would have been able to play if I 'd stayed healthy , '' he says .
Back in 1975 , late in the season , a then-21 Mr. Gideon made his only major league appearance , five and two-thirds innings for the Texas Rangers against the Chicago White Sox .
He gave up seven hits , walked five and did n't get a decision .
Arm troubles forced him back to the minors
the next year .
`` There 's a satisfaction in going against the rules , '' offers Will McEnaney , once a stopper with Cincinnati 's Big Red Machine .
He means the rule that a player ca n't cut it after a certain age .
These days
he hustles to house-painting jobs in his Chevy pickup before and after training with the Tropics .
While sipping a beer after practice , he vividly recounts getting the Red Sox 's Carl Yastrzemski to pop out to end the 1975 World Series , and repeating the feat against the Yankees ' Roy White in 1976 .
Some of the game 's reigning philosophers dislike the idea of middle-aged men attempting a young man 's sport .
`` I personally do n't enjoy seeing players
who
I remember vividly from their playing days running about and being gallant about their deficiencies , '' says Roger Angell , New Yorker magazine 's resident baseball sage .
`` I feel people should be allowed to remember players as they were .
Worse , says baseball author Lawrence Ritter , `` Someone will get a heart attack and that will be the end of the whole story .
But the ballplayers disagree .
Most are trim .
Some have been training for months ; others only recently left active status .
( No one has worked out the players ' average age , but most appear to be in their late 30s .
) And there 's pride .
`` I 'm not going to look stupid , '' vows former Pittsburgh Pirate second baseman Rennie Stennett , sweat dotting his brow as he prepares for some practice swings .
`` It 's going to be a tough league , '' promises the 47-year-old Mr. Campaneris .
`` There will be a lot of malice .
'' Men
who have played hard all their lives are n't about to change their habits , he says .
Nonetheless , one ca n't help wonder whether the game will be just a little bit slower .
At the weatherbeaten Pompano Beach municipal stadium , Mr. Blair , the 45-year-old former Oriole , knows his power is n't what
it used to be .
So he adjusts .
He no longer crowds the plate .
He 's not thinking about home runs anymore , just base hits .
Still , `` how sweet
it is , '' he says , savoring the fat sound of the well-hit line drive that bounces off the center field wall .
And do n't expect many complete games by pitchers -- perhaps three out of 288 , laughs Mr. Fingers , the former Oakland reliever .
Expect `` tricky '' stuff from pitchers , says Mr. Weaver , the manager .
Expect brushbacks but no beanballs , says Mr. McEnaney .
Even expect stolen bases , says the wiry and fit Mr. Campaneris : `` If you know how to slide , it 's no problem , '' he says .
And expect slower fastballs .
`` I 'm not so young anymore , '' concedes the cigar-chomping , 48-year-old Mr. Tiant .
`` I wo n't be throwing 90 mph , but I will throw 80-plus , '' he says .
White-haired Pedro Ramos , at 54
the league 's oldest player and a pitcher-coach with the Suns , has lost even more speed .
Stuffing a wad of Red Man into his cheek , he admits the fastball
he brought into the majors in 1955 has become a slowball .
Its maximum velocity is 72 mph .
But he is n't worried .
He will compensate with the guile learned from his years in the majors .
He has good control .
He will keep the ball down , move it around .
After all , he says , `` Even to make love , you need experience .
Manville Corp. said it will build a $ 24 million power plant to provide electricity to its Igaras pulp and paper mill in Brazil .
The company said the plant will ensure that it has adequate energy for the mill and will reduce the mill 's energy costs .
Manville said it expects the plant to begin operating at the end of 1991 .
Canadian steel production totaled 290,541 metric tons in the week ended Oct. 21 , a 5.1 % increase from 276,334 tons
the previous week but a 7.2 % decline from 313,125 tons
a year earlier , Statistics Canada said .
The federal agency said that in the year through Oct. 21 production totaled 12,573,758 tons , up 7.1 % from 11,742,368 tons .
The hottest rivalry in the computer industry intensified sharply yesterday as Digital Equipment Corp. announced its first line of mainframe computers , targeting International Business Machines Corp. 's largest market .
IBM fired back with new mainframes of its own , extending the long-dominant 3090 line with a 7 % to 14 % power boost .
Up to now , the intense competition between IBM and Digital has been confined largely to the broad midrange of the computer market , where Digital sought to exploit IBM 's weaknesses in networking .
But Digital 's move into mainframes will target IBM 's home turf , where it has a commanding 70 % share of the market .
Digital , Maynard , Mass. , insisted yesterday that its marketing focus would differ sharply from IBM 's .
`` This is not your father 's mainframe , '' said Allan McGuire , a Digital spokesman .
`` It 's a whole new generation , '' he said .
IBM , which gets about half its revenue and more than half its profit from mainframes , also announced upgraded operating system software that , together with the new hardware , lets customers do so-called batch processing as much as 60 % faster .
Batch processing is the high-volume , single-job data processing that most mainframes typically chug through at night , such as updating accounts at banks .
IBM said the 16 new J and JH models will generally be available immediately , though three wo n't ship until the third quarter of next year .
Prices on the larger models , which range as high as $ 13 million , generally wo n't change .
Small models , whose performance increased as much as 46 % , will carry higher prices .
Upgrades to bigger models also will be costlier .
Digital 's VAX 9000 mainframes , which
it claimed were among the fastest available , were priced from $ 1.2 million to $ 3.9 million , sharply lower than IBM models of comparable power .
The first models will ship in the spring , with the largest following in the fall .
Analysts were disappointed that Digital 's new line apparently wo n't contribute much to earnings before the next fiscal year , which begins in July .
Jay Stevens of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. said he may cut his earnings estimate for the current fiscal year because he had expected at least
some mainframe profit
this year .
But he added that he expected to raise his estimate for fiscal 1991 at the same time .
After the announcement yesterday , Digital shares gained $ 1.25 to close at $ 89.875 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading .
IBM shares closed at $ 103 , down 50 cents , in Big Board trading .
Analysts have predicted strong pent-up demand for the new line among Digital 's customers .
Large Digital buyers say the new VAX will let them stay with Digital when they need the power of a mainframe , instead of turning to IBM .
`` I 'm convinced there 's a huge market for this machine , '' said Stephen Smith of PaineWebber Inc .
Digital also plans to compete fiercely with IBM when the giant 's customers are computerizing new aspects of their businesses .
Digital , however , does n't expect to displace IBM mainframes
that are already installed at big companies .
In addition to commercial markets , Digital 's new line targets the low end of the engineering and scientific supercomputer market , when it 's packaged with an optional supercharger , known as a vector processor .
Digital 's push into mainframes comes at a time when its mainstay minicomputer line is under growing pressure from smaller personal computers and workstations
that operate on standard operating systems rather than on the proprietary systems that older minicomputers use .
Although Digital has staked out a major presence in the booming workstation market , profit margins in that market are much slimmer than for mainframes .
The slow-growing mainframe market also has shown new signs of life lately .
IBM 's mainframe sales have held up better than expected this year , with analysts estimating they have risen 10 % to 12 % .
`` Demand for these systems has been very , very strong , '' said Bill Grabe , a senior IBM marketing executive .
`` We have a good strong backlog for the fourth quarter even without '' the systems
that were announced yesterday .
But the 3090 line is nearly five years old -- which is getting up there in mainframe years -- and its growth is expected to slow in 1990 .
IBM , Armonk , N.Y. , said it wanted to bring out the mainframes as soon as it could to spark as many sales as possible by the end of the year .
The fourth quarter is always IBM 's biggest by far , with most sales coming in December as customers seek to use budgets before year end .
Still , Steve Cohen , an analyst at SoundView Financial Group Inc. , said , `` I do n't see that this will be sufficient to give IBM
a significant kick in the fourth quarter .
IBM has already indicated it will have problems in the quarter , partly because of a delay in shipping a high-end disk drive and partly because the strong dollar will cut significantly the value of IBM 's overseas earnings when translated into dollars .
Some analysts have estimated IBM 's fourth-quarter per-share earnings will fall 10 % to $ 3.57
a share from $ 3.97
In addition to the new mainframe hardware and software , IBM announced a magnetic-tape system for data storage that it said occupies half as much floor space as older systems but can store five times as much data on a single cartridge .
That should help IBM address the damage that a resurgent Storage Technology Corp. has inflicted in that market .
South Korean consumer prices rose 5 % in the first 10 months of this year , matching the government 's target for the entire year , according to the Bank of Korea and the Economic Planning Board .
According to reports released by the two government agencies , domestic consumer and wholesale prices
each rose by 0.2 % in October from the previous month .
As a result , consumer prices for the first 10 months of 1989 surged by 5 % and wholesale prices by 1.3 % .
The South Korean government had been projecting a 5 % consumer price increase for the entire year .
Farm prices in October edged up 0.7 % from September as raw milk prices continued their rise , the Agriculture Department said .
Milk sold to the nation 's dairy plants and dealers averaged $ 14.50 for each hundred pounds , up 50 cents from September and up $ 1.50 from October 1988 , the department said .
Commercial vegetables , led by lettuce and tomatoes , rose 19 % in October ; oranges and other fruits rose 5 % .
Broiler prices fell 6.5 cents in October to 30.6 cents
a pound , while turkey prices rose 1.2 cents
a pound to 38.5 cents .
Egg prices averaged 64.2 cents
a dozen , down 0.2 cent from September .
Hogs rose $ 3.40 to $ 46.80
a hundredweight in October , while beef cattle slipped 80 cents to $ 67.40 for each hundred pounds and calves dropped 90 cents to $ 90.20 .
Soybeans averaged $ 5.28
a bushel , down 42 cents from September ; corn averaged $ 2.20 , down seven cents , and sorghum grain averaged $ 3.61 for each hundred pounds , down 19 cents , according to the department .
Sea Containers Ltd. said it might increase the price of its $ 70-a-share buy-back plan if pressed by Temple Holdings Ltd. , which made an earlier tender offer for Sea Containers .
Sea Containers , a Hamilton , Bermuda-based shipping concern , said Tuesday that it would sell $ 1.1 billion of assets and use some of the proceeds to buy about 50 % of its common shares for $ 70 apiece .
The move is designed to ward off a hostile takeover attempt by two European shipping concerns , Stena Holding AG and Tiphook PLC .
In May , the two companies , through their jointly owned holding company , Temple , offered $ 50
a share , or $ 777 million , for Sea Containers .
In August , Temple sweetened the offer to $ 63
a share , or $ 963 million .
Yesterday , Sea Containers ' chief executive officer , James Sherwood , said in an interview that , under the asset-sale plan , Sea Containers would end up with a cash surplus of approximately $ 620 million .
About $ 490 million of that would be allocated to the buy-back , leaving about $ 130 million , he said .
That $ 130 million , Mr. Sherwood said , `` gives us
some flexibility in case Temple raises its bid .
We are able to increase our price above the $ 70 level if necessary .
'' He declined to say , however , how much Sea Containers might raise its price .
Mr. Sherwood speculated that the leeway that Sea Containers has means that Temple would have to `` substantially increase their bid if they 're going to top us .
Temple , however , harshly criticized Sea Containers ' plan yesterday , characterizing it as a `` highly conditional device designed to entrench management , confuse shareholders and prevent them from accepting our superior cash offer .
A spokesman for Temple estimated that Sea Containers ' plan -- if all the asset sales materialize -- would result in shareholders receiving only $ 36 to $ 45
a share in cash .
The lower figures , the spokesman said , would stem from preferred shares being converted to common stock and the possibility that Sea Containers ' subsidiaries might be required to place their shares in the open market .
Temple added that Sea Containers is still mired in legal problems in Bermuda , where the Supreme Court has temporarily barred Sea Containers from buying back its own stock in a case brought by Stena and Tiphook .
{ The court has indicated it will rule on the case by the end of the month .
}
Temple also said Sea Containers ' plan raises `` numerous legal , regulatory , financial and fairness issues , '' but did n't elaborate .
Mr. Sherwood said reaction to Sea Containers ' proposal has been `` very positive .
'' In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday , Sea Containers closed at $ 62.625 , up 62.5 cents .
The Department of Health and Human Services plans to extend its moratorium on federal funding of research involving fetal-tissue transplants .
Medical researchers believe the transplantation of small amounts of fetal tissue into humans could help treat juvenile diabetes and such degenerative diseases as Alzheimer 's , Parkinson 's and Huntington 's .
But anti-abortionists oppose such research because they worry that the development of therapies using fetal-tissue transplants could lead to an increase in abortions .
James Mason , assistant secretary for health , said the ban on federal funding of fetal-tissue transplant research `` should be continued indefinitely .
'' He said the ban wo n't stop privately funded tissue-transplant research or federally funded fetal-tissue research
that does n't involve transplants .
Department officials say that HHS Secretary Louis Sullivan will support Dr. Mason 's ruling , which will be issued soon in the form of a letter to the acting director of the National Institutes of Health .
Both Dr. Mason and Dr. Sullivan oppose federal funding for abortion , as does President Bush , except in cases where a woman 's life is threatened .
The controversy began in 1987 when the National Institutes of Health , aware of the policy implications of its research , asked for an HHS review of its plan to implant fetal tissue into the brain of a patient suffering from Parkinson 's disease .
The department placed a moratorium on the research , pending a review of scientific , legal and ethical issues .
A majority of an NIH-appointed panel recommended late last year that the research continue under carefully controlled conditions , but the issue became embroiled in politics as anti-abortion groups continued to oppose federal funding .
The dispute has hampered the administration 's efforts to recruit prominent doctors to fill prestigious posts at the helm of the NIH and the Centers for Disease Control .
Several candidates have withdrawn their names from consideration after administration officials asked them for their views on abortion and fetal-tissue transplants .
Antonio Novello , whom Mr. Bush nominated to serve as surgeon general , reportedly has assured the administration that she opposes abortion .
Dr. Novello is deputy director of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development .
Some researchers have charged that the administration is imposing new ideological tests for top scientific posts .
Earlier this week , Dr. Sullivan tried to defuse these charges by stressing that candidates to head the NIH and the CDC will be judged by `` standards of scientific and administrative excellence , '' not politics .
But the administration 's handling of the fetal-tissue transplant issue disturbs many scientists .
`` When scientific progress moves into uncharted ground , there has to be a role for society to make judgments about its applications , '' says Myron Genel , associate dean of the Yale Medical School .
`` The disturbing thing about this abortion issue is that the debate has become polarized , so that no mechanism exists '' for finding a middle ground .
Yale is one of the few medical institutions conducting privately funded research on fetal-tissue transplants .
But Dr. Genel warns that Dr. Mason 's ruling may discourage private funding .
`` The unavailability of federal funds , and the climate in which
the decision was made , certainly do n't provide any incentive for one of the more visible foundations to provide support , '' he said .
Despite the flap over transplants , federal funding of research involving fetal tissues will continue on a number of fronts .
`` Such research may ultimately result in the ability to regenerate damaged tissues or to turn off genes
that cause cancer '' or to regulate genes
that cause Down 's syndrome , the leading cause of mental retardation , according to an NIH summary .
The NIH currently spends about $ 8 million annually on fetal-tissue research out of a total research budget of $ 8 billion .
Mobil Corp. is in the midst of cutting back its exploration and production group , which finds and develops oil and gas reserves in the U.S. , by as much as 15 % as part of a new restructuring of that sector of its business .
Management advised employees Friday that it was going to reduce employment in production operations of the group by 8 % , or 400 people .
The exploration side of the unit has recently undergone a similar overhaul , during which
it also lost as many as 400 employees , a company spokesman said in response to questions .
Mobil Exploration & Producing U.S. Inc. , the group involved , currently has a work force of somewhat less than 5,000 .
A few years ago , Mobil restructured the entire company during an industrywide shakeout .
But since then U.S. oil production has declined and Mobil wants to focus its oil-finding efforts overseas .
Mobil alluded to the work-force cuts last week when it took a $ 40 million charge as part of its third-quarter earnings and attributed it to a restructuring .
Mobil officials said that it is unlikely any additional charges related to this move will be taken in future quarters .
On Wednesday , Mobil will begin offering separation packages and voluntary retirement in its U.S. production operation .
Mobil officials said they have been studying ways of streamlining these operations since early this year .
During the coming months , layers of management will be peeled away and regional offices will become more autonomous .
For greater efficiency , employees at those locations will be reorganized into teams responsible for managing the properties under their jurisdiction , Mobil said .
`` The main feature of the new organization is that each local manager will have both
the authority and accountability for profitable and technically sound operations , '' said Charles E. Spruell , president of the Mobil unit .
Field offices at New Orleans ; Houston ; Denver ; Midland , Tex. ; Bakersfield , Calif. ; Oklahoma City ; and Liberal , Kan. , will be maintained .
But the staffs at some of those locations will be slashed while at others
the work force will be increased .
For instance , employment in Denver will be reduced to 105 from 430 .
But on the West Coast , where profitable oil production is more likely than in the midcontinent region , the Bakersfield , Calif. , office staff of 130 will grow by 175 to 305 .
The reorganization will `` focus on the value and potential of assets , '' Mr. Spruell said .
Burmah Oil PLC , a British independent oil company , said its West German subsidiary Castrol has a 49 % share in Explonaft G.m.b.H. , a new Polish lubricants company .
The remaining 51 % of the joint venture will be controlled by Polish lubricants manufacturers , refiners and technical institutes .
Explonaft will develop application guidelines for lubricants , sell high-quality mineral oils , and offer services in industrial cleaning and related fields .
Burmah , which has a strong market position supplying marine lubricants and metal-working fluids in Poland , described the joint venture as `` fairly small .
'' It did n't provide details of setup costs .
Melvin Belli 's San Francisco law offices may have been the epicenter of legal activity after Tuesday 's earthquake .
In the first 25 minutes after his office 's telephone service was restored yesterday morning , 17 potential clients had called seeking the services of the self-proclaimed King of Torts .
Mr. Belli , like many other personal-injury lawyers , suspects that the earthquake , which measured 6.9 on the Richter scale , will generate enough lawsuits to keep this city 's personal-injury and construction lawyers busy for quite some time .
Suits are likely to be filed against engineering firms , contractors and developers , as well as against local-government agencies .
But lawyers looking to cash in on the quake may have a tough time once their cases reach a judge .
Experts on California tort law say protections afforded government agencies in such cases are pretty ironclad .
Even claims against individuals and companies face significant roadblocks .
The major legal barrier is the principle that no one can be held liable for an `` act of God .
For now , says Laurence Drivon , president-elect of the 6,000-member California Trial Lawyers Association , `` the last thing
we really need to worry about is whether anybody is going to get sued , or whether they have liability or not .
We still have people wandering around in a daze in San Francisco worrying about whether it 's going to rain tonight .
But that wo n't stop plaintiffs ' lawyers from seeking a little room for maneuvering .
In San Francisco , they argue , an earthquake was a near certainty .
Therefore , engineering firms , construction contractors and developers can be sued for not keeping structures up to standard , and government agencies can be held accountable for failing to properly protect citizens from such a foreseeable disaster , if negligence can be proven .
`` My prediction is there will be mass litigation over errors and omissions in engineering and contracting , '' says Stanley Chesley , a well-known Cincinnati plaintiffs lawyer .
From what
he saw on television , Mr. Chesley points out that Interstate 880 , which collapsed and killed more than 200 commuters , suffered serious damage while surrounding buildings appeared to sustain no damage whatsoever .
He adds that `` they were aware of the propensity for earthquakes and the San Andreas Fault .
The flamboyant and publicity-conscious Mr. Belli says he already has investigators looking into who could be held liable for the damage on the Bay Bridge and the interstate approaching it .
`` We wo n't know until the smoke clears -- but yes , we 're looking into it , '' he says .
Mr. Belli says he wants to know whether state or federal engineers or private companies could have prevented the damage .
Mr. Belli , who was at Candlestick Park for the World Series Tuesday night , says he has hired civil engineers to check out his own mildly damaged building and to investigate the bridge collapse .
Defense lawyers , perhaps understandably , say that plaintiffs ' lawyers taking such an approach will have little success in pursuing their claims , though they add that the facts of each case must be looked at individually .
`` A lot of this is going to be code-related , '' says Ignazio J. Ruvolo , a construction law specialist at Bronson , Bronson & McKinnon , a San Francisco law firm .
Plaintiffs , he says , will argue that damaged structures were n't built to proper design standards .
But if defendants can prove that they met San Francisco 's stringent building codes , `` that 's probably going to protect them , '' Mr. Ruvolo says .
Government entities , continues Mr. Ruvolo , could be protected by the California Government Tort Liability Act .
Under the statute , agencies are provided `` defenses
that normally are n't available in the private sector , '' Mr. Ruvolo says .
`` The legislature does not want to inhibit the unique government activities by exposing public entities to liability .
Built into the statute are so-called design immunities , which are likely to protect government agencies , according to Mr. Ruvolo and Richard Covert , a lawyer with the California Department of Transportation , which oversees the damaged Bay Bridge .
The state is protected when plans and designs for public structures were approved ahead of time or when structures met previously approved standards , says Mr. Covert .
He believes those defenses might well apply to the Bay Bridge collapse .
Nevertheless , he adds , `` I would n't get totally shocked if we get lawsuits out of the Bay Bridge .
If there 's going to be a race to the courthouse , it
has n't started yet .
Mr. Covert had to search through law books scattered on the floor of his office yesterday , and Mr. Belli 's courtyard was strewn with bricks .
Wednesday , Mr. Belli 's staff was n't permitted into his office by city officials worried about their safety .
He said he set up shop on the sidewalk in front of his town-house office and helped victims apply for federal aid -- free of charge .
In a news release issued by Mr. Drivon , the trial lawyers association also promised free assistance to victims .
The association said it would monitor the conduct of lawyers and warned that solicitation of business is unethical .
After being whipsawed by a volatile stock market , Treasury bonds closed higher .
But junk bonds took more hits .
Early in the day , bond dealers said trading volume was heavy as large institutional investors scrambled to buy long-term Treasury bonds on speculation that the stock market 's volatility would lead to a `` flight-to-quality '' rally .
That happens when nervous stock investors dump equities and buy Treasurys , which are higher in quality and thus considered safe .
`` Some retail accounts , such as commercial banks and pension funds , wanted to get on the bandwagon before it was too late , '' said Sung Won Sohn , chief economist at Norwest Corp. , Minneapolis .
At one point , the Dow Jones Industrial average fell about 80 points on news that UAL Corp. decided to remain independent .
In response , Treasury prices soared 1 1\/8 points , or about $ 11.25 for each $ 1,000 face amount .
But the gains in Treasury bonds were pared as stocks staged a partial recovery .
The industrial average ended at 2659.22 , down 3.69 points .
Economists said the bond market 's strength also is a sign that investors expect the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates amid growing evidence that the economy is slowing .
While they do n't expect the Fed to move right away , they say the case for lower rates is building .
Yesterday , for example , the Commerce Department reported that new orders for durable goods fell 0.1 % , while the nation 's auto makers reported lackluster mid-October sales .
The Treasury 's 30-year bond ended over 1\/4 point higher .
Municipal , mortgage-backed and investment-grade corporate bonds rose 1\/8 to 1\/2 point .
But high-yield , high-risk bonds fell 1\/4 to 1\/2 point with the stock market early in the session and never recovered .
According to a trader at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. , the hardest hit junk bonds were those issued by RJR Holdings Capital Corp. , which are the easiest to sell .
RJR 's 14.70 % bonds due 2007 fell 2 1\/2 points .
Trading activity in the junk market was extremely light as dealers could n't find enough buyers to match sellers .
`` While the stock market was falling , most { junk bond holders } were just watching it not knowing what to do , '' said Paul Suckow , director of fixed-income securities at Oppenheimer Management Corp .
`` It was like driving down the highway watching a wreck .
Everybody was rubber-necking .
Adding to the junk market 's jitters were reports that Donaldson , Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp. is having trouble structuring a $ 1.6 billion offering for TW Food Services Inc. and will postpone or even cancel the issue .
TW is the largest franchisee of Hardee 's , a fast-food restaurant , and operates several other food chains .
Donaldson Lufkin would n't comment .
Credit analysts said investors are nervous about the issue because they say the company 's ability to meet debt payments is dependent on too many variables , including the sale of assets and the need to mortgage property to retire some
existing debt .
Also , the TW offering includes interest-deferred and pay-in-kind securities , which are currently unpopular .
Meanwhile , investors turned a cold shoulder to the Treasury 's sale of $ 10 billion of new two-year notes yesterday .
`` It 's not too surprising that the auction was sloppy , given the volatility in the bond market because of stocks , '' said Robert T. McGee , a senior vice president at Tokai Bank Ltd .
`` People are looking past supply to lower interest rates , but they 're also worried about being whipsawed by the volatility in the stock market .
The new two-year notes were priced with an average yield of 7.74 % .
That was higher than the 7.71 % to 7.73 % average yield that traders had expected .
In when-issued trading , the notes were quoted at a price to yield 7.78 % .
Sluggish demand was also evidenced by the weak 2.41-to-1 bid-to-cover ratio , which was lower than the average 2.79-to-1 ratio at the last 12 similar auctions .
The ratio , which reflects the number of bids
the Treasury receives for each bid accepted , is used to gauge investor demand .
Dealers said players shied away from the note sale because they were concerned that prices at the time of the auction might erode if the stock market staged a recovery , which , in fact , did happen .
Individual and Japanese participation in the auction was disappointing , according to dealers .
`` Interest by Japanese investors was limited , '' said Michael Moran , chief economist at Daiwa Securities America Inc .
`` They are typically not active in two-year note auctions , but today 's participation could be viewed as lighter-than-normal .
However , Mr. Moran added that the Japanese generally have a positive view of the U.S. bond market because of expectations that the dollar will remain strong and interest rates will decline .
He said , `` Possibly , they 're waiting to buy at the ( quarterly ) refunding '' of government debt to be held next month by the Treasury .
A trader at a Japanese firm estimated that the Japanese purchased no more than 10 % of the two-year notes .
Treasury , Agency Securities
Today investors will focus on the long-awaited auction of $ 4.5 billion of 30-year bonds by Resolution Funding Corp .
The initial bond offering by the new government agency , which was created to help rescue the nation 's troubled thrifts , is n't expected to see robust demand .
A small yield premium over comparable Treasurys and a lack of liquidity is hampering dealers ' efforts to drum up interest in the so-called bailout bonds .
In when-issued trading , the Refcorp bonds were quoted at a price to yield 8.17 % .
Yesterday , the benchmark 30-year bond was quoted late at 102 18\/32 to yield 7.89 % , compared with 102 9\/32 to yield 7.93 % on Monday .
The latest 10-year Treasury was quoted at 100 22\/32 to yield 7.88 % , compared with 100 17\/32 to yield 7.9 % .
Short-term rates were unchanged to slightly lower .
The discount rate on three-month Treasury bills was quoted at 7.52 % for a bond-equivalent yield of 7.75 % , while the rate on six-month Treasury bills was quoted at 7.47 % for a yield of 7.85 % .
Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value .
Thus , higher bidding narrows the investor 's return while lower bidding widens it .
Corporate Issues
Several blue-chip companies tapped the new-issue market yesterday to take advantage of falling interest rates .
Three of the largest offerings , by Exxon Capital Corp. , Xerox Corp. and Citicorp , were underwritten by groups led by Salomon Brothers Inc .
Exxon Capital , long-rumored to be a potential debt issuer , offered $ 200 million of 10-year notes priced to yield 8.31 % .
Citicorp issued $ 200 million of seven-year notes priced to yield 8.82 % , and Xerox priced $ 150 million of six-year notes to yield 8.85 % .
Meanwhile , International Business Machines Corp. paved the way for a visit to the credit markets by filing a shelf registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission for $ 800 million in new debt .
This is in addition to IBM 's existing shelf registration under which
$ 200 million in debt securities are available for issuance .
In secondary trading , investment-grade corporate bonds ended 1\/8 to 1\/4 higher .
Municipals
Actively traded municipal bonds ended 1\/4 to 1\/2 point higher in brisk trading , despite a flood of new supply .
New Jersey Turnpike Authority 's 7.20 % issue of 2018 finished 1\/4 point stronger at 98 1\/2 bid , to yield 7.32 % .
Traders said municipals were underpinned by influences including the climb in Treasury issue prices .
Also , municipal bonds lured buying because the stock market remains wobbly , traders contended .
Mainly , though , it was a favorable outlook for yesterday 's new supply that propped up municipals , some traders said .
Among the new issues was Massachusetts 's $ 230 million of general obligation bonds .
The bonds were won by a Goldman , Sachs & Co. group with a true interest cost of 7.17 % .
They were priced to yield from 6.00 % in 1990 to 7.20 % in 2009 .
The Massachusetts deal had an unsold balance of $ 84.3 million in late trading , the underwriter said .
Mortgage - , Asset-Backed Securities
Mortgage securities gained 3\/32 to 9\/32 point after a hectic session , with Government National Mortgage Association 8 % securities as the standout issue .
The Ginnie Mae issue rose amid talk of large purchases of the securities by institutional investors .
The derivative markets remained active as one new issue was priced and talk circulated about more offerings in the next day or two .
The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. issued a $ 500 million real estate mortgage investment conduit backed by its 8 1\/2 % securities .
In the asset-backed market , a big offering of Ford Motor Credit Corp .
auto-loan securities was increased in size after strong institutional demand .
The deal by the Ford Motor Co. unit , priced Monday , was increased to $ 3.05 billion from $ 2.58 billion .
Among major pass-through issues , Ginnie Mae 9 % securities for November delivery ended at 98 15\/32 , up 5\/32 , after touching an early high of 98 27\/32 ; 8 % securities were at 94 5\/32 , up 9\/32 ; 9 1\/2 % securities at 100 15\/32 , up 4\/32 ; and 10 % securities at 102 11\/32 , up 3\/32 .
Freddie Mac 9 % securities were at 97 21\/32 , up 5\/32 .
The Ginnie Mae 9 % issue was yielding 9.34 % to a 12-year average life assumption , as the spread above the Treasury 10-year note held at 1.46 percentage points .
Foreign Bonds
The Eurodollar bond market sprang to life late in the European trading session after the Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled .
Eurodollar bonds are often issued by foreign corporations , but interest and principal are paid in dollars .
The bonds ended about 1\/2 point higher yesterday .
Prices of European government bonds also rose as U.S. stocks declined .
West Germany 's 7 % issue due October 1999 rose 0.13 point to 99.93 to yield 7.01 % , while the 6 3\/4 % issue due July 1994 rose 0.05 to 97.70 to yield 7.33 % .
Britain 's 11 3\/4 % Treasury bond due 2003\/2007 rose 17\/32 to 112 6\/32 to yield 10.05 % , while the 12 % notes due 1995 rose 11\/32 to 104 2\/32 to yield 10.93 % .
In Japan , government bond prices fell .
The No. 111 4.6 % bond due 1998 ended on brokers ' screens at 95.22 , down 0.17 point , to yield 5.41 % .
J.C. PENNEY Co. , Dallas , said it issued $ 350 million of securities backed by credit-card receivables .
The offering was priced with an 8.95 % coupon rate at 99.1875 % to yield 9.19 % .
The retailer said the securities are expected to be rated triple-A by Standard & Poor 's Corp. and Aaa by Moody 's Investors Service Inc .
They pay interest only for 115 months , with principal payments beginning thereafter .
The expected average life of the certificates is 10 years , with the final scheduled payment in October , 2001 .
First Boston Corp. is sole underwriter .
As part of the transaction , J.C. Penney will sell a portion of its credit-card receivables to its JCP Receivables Inc. unit , which will then transfer them to a master trust .
The trust will issue the certificates .
Credit support will be provided by a letter of credit facility from Credit Suisse in favor of the trustee , Fuji Bank & Trust Co. , for the benefit of the certificate holders .
J.C. Penney will continue to service the receivables .
When last we left him , FBI Agent Nick Mancuso had solved a murder mystery , unraveled a Washington political scandal , and racked up some pretty good ratings numbers in the miniseries `` Favorite Son .
'' What
next for the crusty FBI agent with the heart of gold ?
A spinoff series , of course .
There are plenty of worse inspirations for shows -- and most of them had already made the fall lineup : a nun raising some lovable orphans .
A den mother raising some lovable teen models .
A bunch of tans and bathing suits posing as lovable lifeguards .
In that context , Robert Loggia 's riveting performance as the unlovable -- even crotchety -- veteran agent seems a better franchise for a series than most .
Week by week on `` Mancuso FBI '' ( NBC , Fridays , 10 p.m .
ET ) , he pokes around the crime styles of the rich , famous and powerful of the Washington scene -- a loose cannon on deck at the FBI .
Over the first few weeks , `` Mancuso FBI '' has sprung straight from the headlines , which is either a commendable stab at topicality , or a lack of imagination , or both .
The opening show featured a secretary of defense designate accused of womanizing ( a la John Tower ) .
When his secretary is found floating dead in the pol 's pool , Mancuso is called in to investigate .
Last week , a young black girl claimed she had been raped by a white police officer ( a la Tawana Brawley ) .
In this week 's show , there 's an unsafe nuclear weaponsmaking facility ( a la Rocky Flats ) .
Along the way , we 're introduced to the supporting cast : a blond bombshell secretary ( Randi Brazen -- her real name , honest ) , a scheming young boss ( Fredric Lehne ) , another blonde bombshell
who 's also an idealistic lawyer ( Lindsay Frost ) , and a forensics expert ( Charles Siebert ) .
If all of this seems a little stale , it 's redeemed in part by some tricky plot twists : The usual suspects are found to be guilty , then not guilty , then guilty -- but of a different crime .
( In last week 's rape case , for example , the girl turns out to have been a victim of incest , and the biggest villains are the politicians
who exploit the case .
) Most of all though , the show is redeemed by the character of Mancuso .
What makes the veteran FBI man so endearing is his hard-bitten cynicism -- earned , we discover , when he was assigned to the civil rights movement back in the 1960s .
He
was n't protecting the Freedom Marchers ; he was tailing them as subversives .
This is not the `` Mississippi Burning '' scenario
that thrills his young colleagues : `` Kid , you 've been reading Classic Comics too long , '' Mancuso says .
`` Back in 1964 , the FBI had five black agents .
Three were chauffeurs for J. Edgar Hoover , and two cleaned his house .
At the core of Mr. Loggia 's Mancuso is his world-weary truculence .
He describes a reporter as `` Miss First Amendment .
'' He describes a drowned corpse as `` Esther Williams .
'' And when he 's told `` Try a little tenderness , '' he shoots back `` I 'm going home to try a little linguine .
Yet for all his cynicism , he 's at heart
a closet idealist , a softy with a secret crush on truth , justice and the American Way .
He 's the kind of guy
who rescues trampled flags .
If `` Mancuso FBI '' has an intriguing central character , it also has a major flaw : It 's wildly overwritten .
Executive Producers Steve Sohmer and Jeff Bleckner ( and writer\/producers Ken Solarz and Steve Bello ) have revved this show up to the breaking point .
To start , there 's always a crisis -- and someone always worries , `` What if the press gets a hold of this ?
'' At least once an episode
we see protestors marching around screaming slogans .
At least once Mancuso 's boss yells `` In here -- now , '' and proceeds to dress his investigator down : `` You are a dinosaur ...
a hangover in a $ 10 suit ...
One more word and you are out on a park bench , mister .
'' Finally , of course , the boss gives in , but he 's still yelling : `` I find myself explaining anything to Teddy Kennedy , you 'll be chasing stolen cars in Anchorage .
In fact , throughout `` Mancuso FBI , '' we do n't get words or lines -- we get speeches .
Witnesses shout , scream , pontificate : `` ... a dream that the planet could be saved from itself and from the sadistic dumb creatures
who try to tear down every decent man
who raises his voice .
And Mancuso himself is investigating at the top of his lungs : `` How the hell can you live with yourself ? '' he erupts at a politician .
`` You twist people 's trust .
You built your career on prejudice and hate .
The scars will be here years after the polls close .
In each show , Mancuso gets to unleash similar harangues : `` Where the hell are they gon na live when people like you turn the world into a big toxic waste dump ?
You 're the real criminal here ... and what
you did was n't just a murder -- it was a crime against humanity .
And , at least once a show , someone delivers the line `` Get off that soapbox .
'' Now that 's advice
the writers should take to heart .
They have a series with a good character , some interesting , even occasionally surprising plot lines , and they 're ruining it .
Why , when a key witness disappears , does Mancuso trash her apartment , tearing down drapes , smashing walls ?
It 's a bizarre and totally inappropriate reaction , all to add more pizzazz to a script
that 's already overdosing on pizzazz .
That 's not plot .
That 's not character .
That 's hyperventilating .
There is a scene at the end of the first week 's show where Mancuso attends the unveiling of the memorial to his dead partner David .
Asked to say a few words , he pulls out his crumpled piece of paper and tries to talk , but he 's too choked up to get the words out .
He bangs on the piece of paper in frustration , then turns and walks away .
It was a profoundly moving moment for series television , and Robert Loggia 's acting resonated in the silence .
There 's a pretty good program inside all the noise of `` Mancuso FBI .
'' If the show 's creators could just let themselves be quiet for a little , they might just hear it .
BRAMALEA Ltd. said it agreed to issue 100 million Canadian dollars ( US$ 85.1 million ) of 10.5 % senior debentures due Nov. 30 , 1999 , together with 100,000 bond purchase warrants .
The Toronto-based real estate concern said each bond warrant entitles the holder to buy C$ 1,000 principal amount of debentures at par plus accrued interest to the date of purchase .
The warrants expire Nov. 30 , 1990 .
The issue will be swapped into fixed-rate U.S. dollars at a rate
the company said is less than 9 % ; a spokesman declined to elaborate .
Lead underwriters for the issue are Scotia McLeod Inc. and RBC Dominion Securities Inc. , both Toronto-based investment dealers .
Bramalea said it expects to complete the issue by the end of the month .
Small businesses say a recent trend is like a dream come true : more-affordable rates for employee-health insurance , initially at least .
But then they wake up to a nightmare .
The reasonable first-year rates can be followed by increases of 60 % or more if a covered employee files a major claim , they complain .
Insurance premiums for one small Maryland concern went up 130 % in less than two years , the last increase coming after one of its three workers developed a herniated disk .
`` There 's a distinct possibility that I may lose my job over this , '' the employee , Karen Allen , of Floor Covering Resources , Kensington , Md. , recently told a congressional hearing .
She said her employer ca n't afford the rate increases , and she fears she wo n't find another job with a benefit plan covering her ailment .
For employee and employer alike , the worry is widespread .
Surveys repeatedly show that small-business owners rank the availability and rising cost of health insurance as one of their biggest concerns .
The House Energy and Commerce Committee 's health subcommittee , headed by Democratic Rep. Henry Waxman of California , is looking into complaints that small businesses not only ca n't keep reasonably priced employee-health insurance if claims are filed , but often ca n't get coverage at all if a worker is termed medically uninsurable .
`` I have an old-fashioned name for people in that position : sick people
who need health insurance , '' Rep. Waxman says .
we 're seeing now makes a mockery of the idea of insurance : collect premiums from the healthy , dump the sick and let them pay their own bills .
'' Some lawmakers may seek legislation to limit overly restrictive insurance policies .
The concern grows out of increased efforts by the insurers to woo the small-business market .
As larger companies increasingly self-insure , or use reserves to pay their own workers ' medical bills , the insurance industry has turned to the small-employer market
that was once a backwater for them .
`` Insurance companies will offer a good rate if no one is sick , but it 's a roll of the dice , '' says Rosemary Heinhold of the Small Business Service Bureau , a group representing 35,000 small businesses nationwide .
`` One case of cancer or a high-risk pregnancy with a sick infant , and rates go up 40 % to 60 % .
Small-business people end up paying insurance premiums worth two to three times
the cost of one illness .
In addition , the group says some of its member companies have been denied insurance because individual workers had medical problems
that ranged from a mild cardiac condition to psychological counseling after a divorce , hemorrhoids and overweight .
The Health Insurance Association of America , an insurers ' trade group , acknowledges that stiff competition among its members to insure businesses likely to be good risks during the first year of coverage has aggravated the problem in the small-business market .
But it says that rapid rate increases are directly tied to the soaring cost of health care .
Some business analysts blame the problem on tough competition in the insurance market .
They say insurance companies use policies aimed at excluding bad risks because their competitors do .
But the general practice makes it more difficult to combine small groups of people into larger groups , thus spreading the risk over a larger base of premiums .
`` I 'm not accusing insurers of dereliction of duty , '' Robert Patricelli of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce told Mr. Waxman 's panel .
`` You ca n't ask one carrier to underwrite on social grounds when that might destroy it in the marketplace .
Rep. Waxman and Democratic Sen. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts have proposed regulation to deal with the problem .
The proposal is just part of legislation
that would require businesses to provide health benefits , an idea
that is strongly opposed by small business
who say it would just compound the insurance-cost problems .
But small-business lobbyists say they support the idea , included in the Kennedy-Waxman bill , of new laws or regulations requiring greater use of community rating , which pegs rates to the use of health care by a community or other large group , and is designed to prevent insurance companies from taking only low-risk small companies as clients .
But first on the list of priorities , says the National Federation of Independent Business , is to prohibit state laws requiring the inclusion of specialty items , such as psychiatric care , in basic health plans .
Such requirements , they argue , make it difficult to provide a basic , low-cost health-benefits package .
`` Before the state of Wisconsin mandated that mental-health care be covered , there were only 70 mental-health clinics in the state ; now there are 400 , '' says Carolyn Miller , an NFIB lobbyist .
She contends that similar mandates have driven up insurance costs 20 % in Maryland and 30 % in California .
The insurance-industry association also strongly disagrees with the proposed community rating , which `` does n't save one dollar , '' argues James Dorsch , HIAA 's Washington counsel .
`` It just makes healthy businesses subsidize unhealthy ones and gives each employer less incentive to keep his workers healthy .
'' Mr. Dorsch says the HIAA is working on a proposal to establish a privately funded reinsurance mechanism to help cover small groups
that ca n't get insurance without excluding certain employees .
The complexities of the insurance problem make the outcome difficult to predict .
But to Ms. Allen , the employee
whose back problem triggered a huge insurance-rate increase , the issue was simple .
`` What good is having health insurance , '' she asked , `` when it 's so expensive that it becomes impossible to keep after only one major claim ?
In an Oct. 19 review of `` The Misanthrope '' at Chicago 's Goodman Theatre ( `` Revitalized Classics Take the Stage in Windy City , '' Leisure & Arts ) , the role of Celimene , played by Kim Cattrall , was mistakenly attributed to Christina Haag .
Ms. Haag plays Elianti .

Federal Reserve critics used to complain of `` stop and go '' monetary policies .
They claimed that the Fed would first give a green light to the economy by making credit readily available and then turn on the red and bring growth to a screeching halt .
But under Alan Greenspan
that has changed .
A supremely cautious man , the Fed chairman is forever blinking yellow .
Indeed , his caution has become legendary within the government .
fusses endlessly over economic statistics , dissecting them in dozens of ways , probing for hours in search of potential problems .
After thoroughly digesting reams of information , he often concludes that more data are needed , and when he finally decides to act , his movements sometimes seem excrutiatingly small .
Such caution was evident after the recent Friday-the-13th stock market plunge .
Some Bush administration officials urged Mr. Greenspan to make an immediate public announcement of his plans to provide ample credit to the markets .
But he refused , claiming that he wanted to see what happened Monday morning before making any public statement .
Mr. Greenspan 's decision to keep quiet also prompted a near-mutiny within the Fed 's ranks .
A `` senior Fed official '' spoke on Saturday after the market swoon to both
the Washington Post and the New York Times , saying the Fed was prepared to provide as much credit as the markets needed .
The statement angered Chairman Greenspan , but it was greeted with applause by the Bush administration and the financial markets .
And , while the mutinous Fed member has n't gone public , some Fed governors , most notably Vice Chairman Manuel Johnson , are known to have disagreed with the chairman 's decision to remain silent .
Ironically , the anonymous official 's comments have earned some plaudits for Mr. Greenspan , who is mistakenly seen as the source .
At a hearing last week , Democratic Sen. Chris Dodd of Connecticut told Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady that `` Chairman Greenspan 's '' announcement over the Oct. 13 weekend was a `` very important statement .
'' Mr. Brady hesitantly replied that he was n't sure whether Mr. Greenspan `` made a statement
himself , or whether that was a newspaper report .
The Fed chairman 's caution was apparent again on the Monday morning after the market 's plunge , when the central bank took only modest steps to aid the markets .
A surprisingly small amount of reserves was added to the banking system .
And , by the end of that week , the key federal funds interest rate , which is largely controlled by the Fed , had settled at 8.75 % , barely changed from the level of just under 9 %
that prevailed the previous week .
Bush administration officials appear increasingly concerned that Mr. Greenspan is cautious to a fault .
Signs of growing weakness in the economy , paired with indications that inflation is staying well under control , have caused them to wonder why the Fed chairman is so grudging in reducing rates .
Those concerns are n't expressed in public .
In fact , the administration and the Fed have been going out of their way in the past two weeks to dispel any impression that they are at odds , fearing stories about an administration-Fed split added to the stock market 's jitters .
Still , the split is there .
The administration 's concerns are understandable .
The economy is showing signs of weakness , particularly among manufacturers .
Exports , which played a key role in fueling growth over the last two years , seem to have stalled .
Factory payrolls and production fell in September , and the auto industry and housing are in a severe crunch .
But Mr. Greenspan remains reluctant to loosen policy , partly because he faces a phalanx of presidents of regional Fed banks
who oppose credit easing .
In addition , the chairman has a wary eye aimed a year or two down the road .
Inflation may be stable at the moment , running at about 4.5 % .
But if the Fed eases too soon , Mr. Greenspan fears , prices may begin to accelerate again next year .
Moreover , if the Fed holds tight , it may be able gradually to reduce inflation , moving toward the zero-inflation goal that the Fed chairman embraced in testimony to Congress last week .
So far , Mr. Greenspan 's cautious approach to policy has served both
him and the nation well .
His hand on the monetary tiller seems one reason why the economy next month seems highly likely to begin an unprecedented eighth year of peacetime growth without a recession .
`` We 've gotten through two stock market crashes , and we 've gone through an election without any major problems , '' says David Hale , an economist of Kemper Financial Services .
`` I think you have to give Greenspan
a good rating .
But such caution is no guarantee against mistakes .
The Fed 's reluctance to ease credit now could be laying the groundwork for a new recession , perhaps starting early next year .
If that happens , Chairman Greenspan could well become an open target .
Already , Congress is toying with legislation to curb the Fed 's independence .
If the economy turns down , such proposals could gain strong momentum .
Merksamer Jewelers Inc. , a fast-growing jewelry store chain , filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law protection from creditors , apparently to speed a management buy-out of the chain .
The filing , made yesterday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court here , follows an agreement by L.J. Hooker Corp. , Merksamer 's owner , to sell the chain to management for an undisclosed price .
GE Capital Corp. , a financial services subsidiary of General Electric Co. , is providing Merksamer management with $ 15 million in financing .
L.J. Hooker , based in Atlanta , filed for Chapter 11 protection in August and has also announced its intention to sell its B. Altman & Co. department store chain .
L.J. Hooker is owned by Hooker Corp. , Sydney , Australia , which
itself is currently being managed by a court-appointed provisional liquidator .
L.J. Hooker 's planned sale of Merksamer is subject to approval by Judge Tina Brozman of U.S. Bankruptcy Court .
Rumors to the effect that the Merksamer chain would file for Chapter 11 arose last week in the jewelry industry .
At that time , Sam Merksamer , president of the chain , angrily denied that his company was about to file .
Mr. Merksamer is leading the buy-out .
According to executives close to the situation , Merksamer filed for Chapter 11 to speed the sale of the chain .
One executive said an accord signed by the unsecured creditors of L.J. Hooker Corp. had frozen in place
all of L.J. Hooker 's assets .
The Merksamer bankruptcy-law filing appears to supersede that agreement .
`` By filing for Chapter 11 , the Merksamer chain will only need approval from a bankruptcy judge for the sale , not the hundreds of unsecured creditors , '' said this executive .
`` The cash from the sale will go to L.J. Hooker , but the company
itself will belong to Sam Merksamer .
Mr. Merksamer and Sanford Sigoloff , chief executive of L.J. Hooker , were unavailable for comment .
In a statement , Mr. Merksamer described the filing as a `` legal technicality , '' but also said that `` our inability to obtain trade credit , combined with a need to ensure that our stores were properly stocked for the Christmas season , necessitated our filing Chapter 11 .
The jewelry chain , which is based in Sacramento , Calif. , had revenue of $ 62 million and operating profit of $ 2.5 million for the year ended June 30 .
Former Democratic fund-raiser Thomas M. Gaubert , whose savings and loan was wrested from his control by federal thrift regulators , has been granted court permission to sue the regulators .
In a ruling by the Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans , Mr. Gaubert received the go-ahead to pursue a claim against the Federal Home Loan Bank Board and the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas for losses
he suffered when the Bank Board closed the Independent American Savings Association of Irving , Texas .
Mr. Gaubert , who was chairman and the majority stockholder of Independent American , had relinquished his control in exchange for federal regulators ' agreement to drop their inquiry into his activities at another savings and loan .
As part of the agreement , Mr. Gaubert contributed real estate valued at $ 25 million to the assets of Independent American .
While under the control of federal regulators , Independent American 's net worth dropped from $ 75 million to a negative $ 400 million , wiping out the value of Mr. Gaubert 's real estate contribution and his stock in the institution .
Mr. Gaubert 's suit to recover his damages was dismissed last year by U.S. District Judge Robert Maloney of Dallas under the Federal Tort Claims Act , which offers broad protection for actions by federal agencies and employees .
Earlier this week , a Fifth Circuit appellate panel upheld Judge Maloney 's dismissal of Mr. Gaubert 's claim as a shareholder but said the judge should reconsider Mr. Gaubert 's claim for the loss of his property .
`` It may depend on whether there was an express or implied promise ... that the federal officials would not negligently cause the deterioration '' of Independent American , the court wrote .
Mr. Gaubert 's lawyer , Abbe David Lowell of Washington , D.C. , says the impact of the ruling on other cases involving thrift takeovers will depend on the degree of similarity in the facts .
`` I do n't know if this will affect one institution or a hundred , '' Mr. Lowell says .
`` It does establish a very clear precedent for suing the FHLBB where there was none before .
MAITRE'D CLAIMS in suit
that restaurant fired her because she was pregnant .
In a suit filed in state court in Manhattan , the American Civil Liberties Union is representing the former maitre 'd of the chic Odeon restaurant .
The suit , which seeks compensatory and punitive damages of $ 1 million , alleges that the firing of Marcia Trees Levine violated New York state 's human-rights law .
Among other things , the law prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex and pregnancy .
The suit alleges that Ms. Levine was fired after she refused to accept a lower paying , less visible job upon reaching her
sixth month of pregnancy .
Ms. Levine told her employer that she was pregnant in February ; a month later , the suit says , the restaurant manager told Ms. Levine that she would be demoted to his assistant because he felt customers would be uncomfortable with a pregnant maitre 'd .
Kary Moss , an attorney with the ACLU 's Women 's Rights Project , said , `` They wanted a svelte-looking woman , and a pregnant woman is not svelte .
They told her , ` We do n't hire fat people and we do n't hire cripples .
And pregnant women are fat .
' '' Ms. Moss said Ms. Levine secretly taped many conversations with her bosses at the Odeon in which
they told her
she was being fired as maitre 'd because she was pregnant .
Paul H. Aloe , an attorney for Odeon owner Keith McNally , denied the allegations .
He said Ms. Levine had never been fired , although she had stopped working at the restaurant .
`` The Odeon made a written offer to Marcia Levine on July 10 to return to work as the maitre 'd , at the same pay , same hours and with back pay accrued , '' he said .
Mr. Aloe said the Odeon `` has no policy against hiring pregnant people .
LAWYERS IN Texas 's biggest bank-fraud case want out in face of retrial .
Lawyers representing five of the seven defendants in the case say their clients can no longer afford their services .
The trial of the case lasted seven months and ended in September with a hung jury .
The defendants were indicted two years ago on charges that they conspired to defraud five thrifts of more than $ 130 million through a complicated scheme to inflate the price of land and condominium construction along Interstate 30 , east of Dallas .
The defense lawyers , three of whom are solo practitioners , say they ca n't afford to put their law practices on hold for another seven-month trial .
Some of the lawyers say they would continue to represent their clients if the government pays their tab as court-appointed lawyers .
Assistant U.S. Attorney Terry Hart of Dallas says the government will oppose any efforts to bring in a new defense team because it would delay a retrial .
FEDERAL JUDGE ALCEE HASTINGS of Florida , facing impeachment , received an unanticipated boost yesterday .
Sen. Arlen Specter ( R. , Pa .
) urged acquittal of the judge in a brief circulated to his Senate colleagues during closed-door deliberations .
Among other things , the brief cited insufficient evidence .
Sen. Specter was vice chairman of the impeachment trial committee
that heard evidence in the Hastings case last summer .
A former prosecutor and member of the Senate Judiciary Committee , Sen. Specter is expected to exercise influence when the Senate votes on the impeachment today .

Security Pacific Corp. has set its sights on buying its second bank holding company
Security said it signed a letter of intent to purchase La Jolla Bancorp , agreeing to pay $ 15 of its own stock for each share of La Jolla .
Based on the current number of La Jolla shares , that gives the transaction
a value of $ 104 million .
La Jolla is the parent company of La Jolla Bank & Trust Co. , which has 12 branches in San Diego County .
As of Sept. 30 , the bank had assets of $ 511 million and deposits of $ 469 million , Security Pacific said .
Earlier this month , Security Pacific , which is among the 10 largest bank holding companies in the U.S. , completed the acquisition of San Diego-based Southwest Bancorp .
The top state environmental official in Massachusetts said Clean Harbors Inc. 's environmental-impact statement for a proposed incinerator in Braintree was inadequate .
The official , John DeVillars , asked Clean Harbors for more information before ruling on a permit for the site .
Critics of the plan , including the town of Braintree , say the incinerator is a health hazard .
Clean Harbors , based in Quincy , said it `` will proceed expeditiously '' to submit the data requested .
Alan McKim , chief executive officer of Clean Harbors said he was `` very much encouraged '' by the official 's praise of Clean Harbors for the quality of some of the data in the report .
One of Ronald Reagan 's attributes as President was that he rarely gave his blessing to the claptrap
that passes for `` consensus '' in various international institutions .
In fact , he liberated the U.S. from one of the world 's most corrupt organizations -- UNESCO .
This is the U.N. group
that managed to traduce its own charter of promoting education , science and culture .
Ever since , the remaining members have been desperate for the United States to rejoin this dreadful group .
Now UNESCO apologists are lobbying President Bush to renege on President Reagan 's decision to depart .
But we can think of many reasons to stay out for the foreseeable future and well beyond .
The U.S. , along with Britain and Singapore , left the agency when its anti-Western ideology , financial corruption and top leadership got out of hand .
The personal antics of agency Director Amadou-Mahtar M'Bow drew much attention , such as when several of his top aides were uncovered as KGB plants and ejected from France and when a mysterious office fire was set just before Congress sent accountants to trace U.S. funds .
Mr. M'Bow was an extreme case , but even his replacement , the more personally genial Spanish biochemist Federico Mayor , has had little success at achieving reforms .
Several ridiculous projects continue , including the `` New International Economic Order , '' which means redistributionism from the West to pay for everyone else 's statism .
The Orwellian `` New World Information Order '' would give government officials rights against the press ; journalists would be obliged to kowtow to their government , which would have licensing and censorship powers and , indeed , duties to block printing of `` wrong '' ideas .
UNESCO somehow converted the founding U.N. ideals of individual rights and liberty into `` peoples ' rights .
'' Million-dollar conferences were held to chew on subjects such as `` ethical responsibilities of scientists in support of disarmament '' and `` the impact of the activities of transnational corporations .
The agency was so totally subverted from the high principles of its founding that even the Soviets now wonder about an agency
that seemed so congenial to them .
Glasnost may be partly responsible , but Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze last year admitted , `` The exaggerated ideological approach undermined tolerance intrinsic to UNESCO .
UNESCO is now holding its biennial meetings in Paris to devise its next projects .
Mr. Mayor 's hope that references to `` press freedom '' would survive unamended seems doomed to failure ; the current phrasing is `` educating the public and media to avoid manipulation .
'' He has n't been able to replace the M'Bow cabal .
Soviets remain in charge of education programs , a former head of an African military tribunal for executions is in charge of culture , and a hard-line Polish communist in exile directs the human-rights and peace division .
Of the agency 's 2,750 staff members , 230 are in the field working on actual projects , such as literacy and oceanographic research .
The position of the United States , which once contributed 25 % of the budget , is that nothing has changed .
John Bolton , the assistant secretary of state for international organizations , told Congress that the continuing `` statist , restrictive , nondemocratic '' programs make rejoining any time soon `` extremely unlikely .
'' This has n't much bothered the UNESCO delegates , who
last week could n't even agree to raise funds by selling off a fancy 19th-century French chateau
the agency somehow owns .
Other countries , including West Germany , may have a hard time justifying continued membership .
We see an even stronger argument against UNESCO than its unsurprising failure to reform .
This is that the Reagan Revolution spanning Eastern Europe and Tiananmen Square shows the power of ideas unencumbered by international civil servants or government functionaries .
Free markets , free minds and free elections have an appeal
that seems to get muddled only when delivered through U.N. organizations -- which of course are made up largely of governments
that fear these principles at home .
The Babelists of the United Nations are experts at obfuscation .
This can have its purposes at times , but there 's no reason to cloud the importance and allure of Western concepts of freedom and justice .
We can see plenty of reasons to stay out , and none to rejoin UNESCO .
An enormous turtle has succeeded where the government has failed : He has made speaking Filipino respectable .
The 6 1\/2-foot-tall turtle , Pong Pagong , is a character
who stars in the children 's television show `` Batibot .
'' He speaks only in Filipino .
`` Batibot , '' which started in 1983 as a hybrid of the U.S. program `` Sesame Street , '' has developed into a distinctly Philippine effort .
Radio programs and books have followed the daily television show .
In the process , `` Batibot , '' an archaic Filipino word meaning `` strong '' or `` enduring , '' has become a powerful advocate of the use of the Filipino language .
`` It impresses on ordinary , young Filipinos that there 's nothing to feel inferior about in using their own language , '' says Randy David , a sociologist and host of a popular television talk show .
`` When we started the program six years ago , the use of Filipino was deemed unwise by the predominantly middle class , '' says Lydia Brown , the program 's creator .
Now , she says , `` it 's no longer an issue .
The success of `` Batibot '' stands in marked contrast to many academic and government attempts to promote Filipino as a national language .
Filipino -- once known as Pilipino -- is predominantly Tagalog , the Malay-based language spoken in a part of the country 's principal island of Luzon .
Resistance to a national language comes primarily from members of the country 's elite , who generally prefer English .
But while better-off Filipinos are quick to cite the logic in using a language as widespread as English , they are often slow to reveal that they are prejudiced against Filipino , say advocates of the native language .
`` For the middle and upper-middle class { Filipino } is declasse , '' says Bien Lumbera , a Philippine-studies professor at Quezon City 's University of the Philippines .
There 's also resentment .
Other opponents of Filipino come from non-Tagalog regions .
They argue that their own languages should have equal weight , although recent surveys indicate that the majority of the country 's population understands Filipino more than any other language .
( There are seven major languages and more than 70 dialects in the country .
What tongue to speak is an emotional mine field in the Philippines .
It is entrenched in the country 's colonial bonds to the U.S. , in Philippine class structure , in the regional loyalties of its people and in its island geography .
As they did when the Philippines was a colony of the U.S. , teachers for the most part teach in English , even though it is a foreign language for most Philippine children .
As a result , they often speak one language at home , another at school .
Mrs. Brown calls the modern-day cultural ambivalence to Filipino
a `` language schizophrenia .
The issue has been simmering for years .
It does n't take much to provoke an intense debate .
When President Corazon Aquino , whose command of Filipino is spotty , announced last year that the language would be used in official communications , there was an uproar from many legislators , who continue to conduct debates mostly in English .
But many proponents of Filipino see resistance to the language finally crumbling .
They believe the media , including `` Batibot , '' have played a crucial role .
According to chief scriptwriter Rene Villanueva , `` Batibot '' does n't set out to advance the cause of Filipino .
`` It 's not as if we 're teaching language per se , '' he says , `` We 're just using it .
These days , `` Batibot '' is produced in a converted lumberyard on a shoestring budget of $ 3,000
a one-hour segment .
It is shown weekdays on two of the country 's five networks .
With an audience totaling more than 400,000 , `` Batibot '' consistently ranks in the country 's top-four most-watched daytime programs .
But advertising revenue is inadequate .
Periodically , there are threats that the program will fold .
`` Batibot '' lacks the polish of `` Sesame Street .
'' Sound stages echo .
Acting sometimes falls flat .
There are only two large puppets in the program : Pong Pagong and a monkey named Kiko Matsing .
But the production is the equal of any local program .
And the show 's creativity makes up for any technological deficiencies .
The program is n't afraid to tackle controversial topics such as nuclear weapons and the environment .
Not that the language war is won , even on `` Batibot .
'' During one recent episode , all the advertisements were in English .
A former Sperry Corp. marketing executive , admitting his role in the Pentagon procurement scandal , pleaded guilty to bribery and conspiracy charges for helping funnel $ 400,000 to a midlevel Navy acquisition official during the early 1980s .
Frank Lavelle , who at the time was the marketing director for Sperry in Clearwater , Fla. , admitted participating in a scheme to bribe Garland Tomlin , the Navy official .
Mr. Tomlin , who left the Navy in 1985 , pleaded guilty earlier this year to related conspiracy , bribery and tax-evasion charges .
The bribery scheme took place between 1982 and 1985 , according to documents filed by prosecutors in connection with Mr. Lavelle 's guilty plea in federal district court in Alexandria , Va .
Sperry merged with Burroughs Corp. to become Unisys Corp. in late 1986 .
Court documents filed by prosecutors indicate Mr. Tomlin tried to steer to Sperry
a multimillion dollar contract to computerize maintenance of certain Navy electronics equiment .
Mr. Tomlin , among other things , illegally provided Mr. Lavelle with inside information and documents intended to give Sperry
an unfair advantage in the competition , the documents said .
Sperry ultimately was eliminated from the competition without receiving the work .
Documents filed by prosecutors also indicate that Mr. Lavelle and his fellow conspirators requested and obtained `` approval of the scheme '' from more-senior Sperry officials `` because the payment
{ Mr .
} Tomlin requested was so large .
'' Charles Gardner , a former Unisys vice president , and James Neal , a former company consultant , have admitted participating in this and other bribery schemes .
Unisys has said that all of the company officials
who participated in improper activities have left the company .
Mr. Lavelle faces a maximum of 20 years in jail and a $ 500,000 fine .
Hadson Corp. said it expects to report a third-quarter net loss of $ 17 million to $ 19 million because of special reserves and continued low natural-gas prices .
The Oklahoma City energy and defense concern said it will record a $ 7.5 million reserve for its defense group , including a $ 4.7 million charge related to problems under a fixed-price development contract and $ 2.8 million in overhead costs
that wo n't be reimbursed .
In addition , Hadson said it will write off about $ 3.5 million in costs related to international exploration leases where exploration efforts have been unsuccessful .
The company also cited interest costs and amortization of goodwill as factors in the loss .
A year earlier , net income was $ 2.1 million , or six cents
a share , on revenue of $ 169.9 million .
Companies listed below reported quarterly profit substantially different from the average of analysts ' estimates .
The companies are followed by at least three analysts , and had a minimum five-cent change in actual earnings per share .
Estimated and actual results involving losses are omitted .
The percent difference compares actual profit with the 30-day estimate where at least three analysts have issues forecasts in the past 30 days .
Otherwise , actual profit is compared with the 300-day estimate .

Research
This year is the 75th anniversary of the Federal Reserve System , and some members of Congress think it
's time to take a fresh look at the nation 's central bank .
After 75 years there may be a few things
that are worth reexamining .
The regional Federal Reserve Bank setup , for instance , may be out of date .
In earlier years
it may have seemed reasonable to give Richmond , Va. , a bank and allow Los Angeles only a branch of the San Francisco bank , but times have changed .
Maybe the whole regional system is an anachronism ; the Fed , after all , is a national central bank .
Some of the would-be reformers , however , want to restore an arrangement
we once had -- or , at least , part of it .
In the beginning , the treasury secretary and the comptroller of the currency were both ex officio members of the Federal Reserve Board .
But in 1935 , when Congress was trying to find someone or something to blame for the Great Depression , it decided to drop both
the secretary and the comptroller from the board .
Carter Glass , a former treasury secretary
who was then back in Congress , probably influenced the decision .
He said that when he was on the board
he felt that he had a great deal of power and , somehow , he did n't think that was a good thing .
Times have changed .
Rep. Byron Dorgan ( D. , N.D .
) has introduced a bill in Congress , co-sponsored by Rep. Lee Hamilton ( D. , Ind. ) , that would put the treasury secretary back on the board .
There is doubt that the change would accomplish much but at least Congress , as in 1935 , would be doing something .
So far no one has suggested putting the comptroller back on the board .
Nicholas Brady , the incumbent treasury secretary , is of course aware of the proposal , and he does n't like it much .
Mr. Dorgen has changed tactics , dropping the seat-for-the-secretary idea .
That may have pleased the secretary , but H. Erich Heinemann , chief economist of the investment firm of Ladenburg , Thalmann & Co. , suggests that Mr. Brady may figure he already has all the power
he needs .
Like most treasury secretaries , Mr. Brady takes a keen interest in monetary matters , of course .
He was , in fact , taking an especially keen interest in board matters even before he went to the treasury .
After the October 1987 market crash , Mr. Brady as a private citizen headed a presidential commission
that tried to decide what went wrong and what should be done about it .
One of the commission 's recommendations was that a single agency , probably the Federal Reserve , should coordinate regulation of all financial markets .
This recommendation might have encouraged a turf-hungry bureaucrat to try to expand his power , but so far Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has n't made a pitch for the job .
The Fed has plenty of responsibilities in times of market turmoil and in 1987 and again in 1989 it appears to have handled them well .
Mr. Brady has said he thought government agencies in the latest market drop were better prepared to coordinate their actions , but he has left no doubt that he still likes the ideas
the commission advanced nearly two years ago .
In recent weeks , moreover , Mr. Brady has joined other administration officials in trying to urge the Fed toward lower interest rates .
The urging admittedly has been gentle .
In an interview with the Washington Post in early October , the secretary said the Fed may be slightly more interested in curbing inflation than the administration is , while the administration may put slightly more emphasis on spurring economic growth .
At least
some economists , of course , would argue that inflation deserves a lot of emphasis .
Earlier this month
the St. Louis Fed held a conference to assess the system 's first 75 years .
Allan Meltzer , a Carnegie-Mellon University economist , noted that the Fed 's record included the longest , most sustained , peacetime inflation in our history , dating from either 1966 or 1967 to 1989 .
The inflation-growth argument is an old one , but Mr. Brady , on the board or off , is surely trying to influence Fed policy .
Equally importantly , the treasury secretary has spearheaded the administration effort to bring the U.S. dollar down by shopping avidly for West German marks and Japanese yen .
The treasury can do something on its own , but to have any hope of success
it needs help from the Fed .
The central bank has been helping , but apparently not especially eagerly .
The Fed has been intervening in foreign currency markets , all right , but through August , at least , it appeared to be `` sterilizing '' the intervention .
In other words , it was offsetting purchases of marks and yen by buying dollars in the domestic money market .
Now , sterilized intervention may have some effect .
When traders see the Fed is in the exchange market
it may make them tread a little carefully , for fear of what
the central bank may do .
But it 's generally accepted that sterilized intervention has little or no lasting impact on currency values .
After August
the Fed may have stopped sterilizing , but it 's hard to see much impact on the dollar .
The dollar is still highly volatile .
The Fed has let interest rates slip slightly , but whether the main reason was dollar intervention , the gloomy reports on manufacturing employment , or the Friday 13 market drop , only Mr. Greenspan and his associates know .
Earlier this year , Martin Feldstein , president of the National Bureau of Economic Research , argued forcefully that a government
that wants steady , stable exchange rates might try some steady stable economic policies .
Trying to manage exchange rates to some desired level , he said , `` would mean diverting monetary and fiscal policies from their customary roles and thereby risking excessive inflation and unemployment and inadequate capital formation .
The more
we think about it , the more
we suspect Mr. Brady does indeed have enough power where he already is .
Analog Devices Inc. said it may purchase as many as one million of its common shares over the next several months .
Analog also said that a one million share buy-back program announced in March is substantially complete .
The company , which makes integrated circuits and other electronic parts , now has about 47 million common shares outstanding .
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday , Analog Devices closed at $ 8.875 , up 25 cents .
A labor-management group is preparing a revised buy-out bid for United Airlines parent UAL Corp.
that would transfer majority ownership to employees while leaving some stock in public hands , according to people familiar with the group .
The group has been discussing a proposal valued in a range of $ 225 to $ 240
a share , or $ 5.09 billion to $ 5.42 billion .
But to avoid the risk of rejection , the group does n't plan to submit the plan formally at a UAL board meeting today .
Instead , the group is raising the proposal informally to try to test the board 's reaction .
People familiar with the company say the board is n't likely to give quick approval to any offer substantially below the $ 300-a-share , $ 6.79 billion buy-out bid
that collapsed last week after banks would n't raise needed loans and after a key partner , British Airways PLC , dropped out .
In composite trading Friday on the New York Stock Exchange , UAL closed at $ 168.50
a share , down $ 21.625 .
But the pilots union , which has been pushing for a takeover since 1987 , appears to be pressing ahead with the revised bid to avoid further loss of momentum even though it
has n't found a partner to replace British Air .
Although the bidding group has n't had time to develop its latest idea fully or to discuss it with banks , it believes bank financing could be obtained .
After the collapse of the last effort , the group does n't plan to make any formal proposal without binding commitments from banks covering the entire amount to be borrowed .
Under the type of transaction being discussed , the pilot-management group would borrow several billion dollars from banks
that could then be used to finance a cash payment to current holders .
Those current holders would also receive minority interests in the new company .
For example , the group could offer $ 200
a share in cash plus stock valued at $ 30
UAL currently has 22.6 million shares , fully diluted .
The new structure would be similar to a recapitalization in which holders get a special dividend yet retain a controlling ownership interest .
The difference is that current holders would n't retain majority ownership or control .
The failed takeover would have given UAL employees 75 % voting control of the nation 's second-largest airline , with management getting 10 % control and British Air 15 % .
was n't clear how the ownership would stack up under the new plan , but employees would keep more than 50 % .
Management 's total could be reduced , and the public could get more than the 15 % control
that had been earmarked for British Air .
One option
the board is likely to consider today is some sort of cooling-off period .
Although the pilots are expected to continue to pursue the bid , UAL Chairman Stephen Wolf may be asked to withdraw from the buy-out effort , at least temporarily , and to return to running the company full time .
The board could eventually come under some pressure to sell the company because its members can be ousted by a majority shareholder vote , particularly since one-third of UAL stock is held by takeover stock speculators
who favor a sale .
The labor-management buy-out group plans to keep its offer on the table in an apparent attempt to maintain its bargaining position with the board .
However , the only outsider
who has emerged to lead such a shareholder vote , Los Angeles investor Marvin Davis , who triggered the buy-out with a $ 5.4 billion bid in early August , is hanging back -- apparently to avoid being blamed for contributing to the deal 's collapse .
Three top advisers to Mr. Davis visited New York late last week , at least in part to confer with executives at Citicorp .
Mr. Davis had paid $ 6 million for Citicorp 's backing of his last bid .
But Citicorp has lost some credibility because it also led the unsuccessful effort to gain bank loans for the labor-management group .
On Friday , British Air issued a statement saying it `` does not intend to participate in any new deal for the acquisition of UAL in the foreseeable future .
'' However , several people said that British Air might yet rejoin the bidding group and that the carrier made the statement to answer questions from British regulators about how it plans to use proceeds of a securities offering previously earmarked for the UAL buy-out .
Also late last week , UAL flight attendants agreed to participate with the pilots in crafting a revised offer .
But the machinists union , whose opposition helped scuttle the first buy-out bid , is likely to favor a recapitalization with a friendly third-party investor .
One advantage
the buy-out group intends to press with the board is that pilots have agreed to make $ 200 million in annual cost concessions to help finance a bid .
Speculation has also arisen that the UAL executive most closely identified with the failure to gain bank financing , chief financial officer John Pope , may come under pressure to resign .
However , people familiar with the buy-out group said Mr. Pope 's departure would weaken the airline 's management at a critical time .
Despite the buy-out group 's failure to obtain financing , UAL remains obligated to pay $ 26.7 million in investment banking and legal fees to the group 's advisers , Lazard Freres & Co. , Salomon Brothers Inc. , and Paul Weiss Rifkind Wharton & Garrison .
I read the exerpts of Wayne Angell 's exchange with a Gosbank representative ( `` Put
the Soviet Economy on Golden Rails , '' editorial page , Oct. 5 ) with great interest , since the gold standard is one of my areas of research .
Mr. Angell is incorrect when he states that the Soviet Union 's large gold reserves would give it `` great power to establish credibility .
'' During the latter part of the 19th century , Russia was on a gold standard and had gold reserves representing more than 100 % of its outstanding currency , but no one outside Russia used rubles .
The Bank of England , on the other hand , had gold reserves
that averaged about 30 % of its outstanding currency , and Bank of England notes were accepted throughout the world .
The most likely reason for this disparity is that the Bank of England was a private bank with substantial earning assets , and the common-law rights of creditors to collect claims against the bank were well established in Britain .
By contrast , in 19th-century Russia
an authoritarian government owned the bank and had the power to revoke payment whenever it chose , much as it would in today 's Soviet Union .
The success of the British gold standard was due to independent private banking and common law , rather than the choice of gold for valuing the currency .
It is no coincidence that from 1844 to 1914 , when the Bank of England was an independent private bank , the pound was never devalued and payment of gold for pound notes was never suspended , but with the subsequent nationalization of the Bank of England , the pound was devalued with increasing frequency and its use as an international medium of exchange declined .
The Soviet Union should keep these lessons in mind as it seeks to establish the ruble as an international currency .
One way to make the ruble into a major international currency would be to leave reserves of gold and earning assets in a Swiss bank with distributions based on Swiss laws .
Unless the laws determining the noteholder 's rights to payment are independent of the issuer of those notes , however , a gold-based ruble would be as unsuccessful for the Soviets as it was for the czars .

First Security Corp. said it tentatively agreed to acquire Deseret Bancorp. for stock valued at about $ 18 million .
Terms call for First Security to issue about 0.55 share of its stock for each Deseret share held , or a total of about 550,000 First Security shares .
It has about 12.3 million shares outstanding .
Deseret , with about $ 100 million in assets , is the parent of the Deseret Bank , which has six offices and headquarters at Pleasant Grove , Utah .
The purchase price is equal to about 1.65 times Deseret 's roughly $ 10.7 million book value , or assets less liabilities .
Salt Lake City-based First Security , with $ 5.4 billion in assets , said the agreement is subject to shareholder and regulatory approval , and that it hopes to complete the transaction early next year .
Hit by higher costs and lower sales , Caterpillar Inc. said third-quarter earnings tumbled 43 % and full-year earnings will trail last year 's results .
The construction equipment maker said third-quarter profit fell to $ 108 million , or $ 1.07
a share , from $ 190 million , or $ 1.87
Sales dropped 6 % to $ 2.58 billion from $ 2.74 billion , reflecting eight fewer business days in the latest quarter .
The company , which is in a costly modernization program , said earnings were hurt by higher start-up and new program costs , increased costs of materials , higher wages and an $ 11 million provision for bad debts in Latin America .
In announcing a 1989 capital spending plan of $ 950 million early this year , Caterpillar said full-year earnings would be flat compared with last year 's $ 616 million , or $ 6.07
But yesterday , the company said this year 's profit will be lower .
It did n't say by how much .
Suffering from a downturn in heavy truck production
that cut orders for its engines , Caterpillar also said it will indefinitely lay off about 325 workers in the Peoria area and temporarily shut its plant in York , Pa. , for two weeks in both November and December .
For the first nine months of the year , Caterpillar said earnings fell 14 % to $ 390 million , or $ 3.85
a share , from $ 453 million , or $ 4.46
Sales rose to $ 8.19 billion from $ 7.65 billion .
National Medical Enterprises Inc. , Los Angeles , said the completion of the spinoff of its long-term care operations will be delayed until early next year because of regulatory complexities .
The health-care services concern announced the spinoff plan last January , then revised it in May and said it hoped to complete it by Nov. 30 .
But the process involves relicensing and other transfers for about 360 separate nursing-home facilities in more than 30 states , the company said , adding that it now plans for the transaction to be completed by Feb. 28 .
The new company , Hillhaven Corp. , is expected to have about $ 150 million in equity , a 2-1 debt-to-equity ratio and to be 10%-owned by NME .
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday , National Medical shares closed at $ 36.125 , down 25 cents .
Michael Grobstein , 46 years old , was named vice chairman for planning , marketing and industry services , a new post .
Mr. Grobstein had been a vice chairman of Ernst & Whinney , an accounting firm
that merged with rival Arthur Young in July to form Ernst & Young , a major accounting , tax and management consulting firm .
Mr. Grobstein 's appointment formalizes a role
he has been performing since the merger , a spokeswoman said .
There may be a truce in the long war of nerves between the White House and Congress over how this country conducts secret intelligence operations abroad .
After years of mistrust born of Watergate , past misdeeds of the Central Intelligence Agency , and the Iran-Contra scandal , President Bush and the Senate Intelligence Committee appear ready -- for now , at least -- to trust each other when it comes to setting policy on covert activities .
If that attitude lasts , it could infuse covert action planning with a level of care and confidence
that has n't been seen in years .
Over the past week , the president has agreed to keep the committee informed , usually in advance , of covert actions and to put key intelligence decisions in writing .
That was n't always the way
the Reagan administration handled such matters .
Mr. Bush has pledged as well to respect the 14-year-old executive order barring U.S. agents from assassinating foreign leaders or helping others to do so .
Congress never fully trusted former CIA chief William Casey and National Security Adviser John Poindexter to honor the ban .
Despite objections by the CIA , Mr. Bush also has agreed to the establishment of an inspector general at the CIA
who would be independent of the CIA director .
In return , the Senate panel has dropped efforts to enact legislation requiring the administration to inform it within 48 hours of the launching of any covert activity .
It also has removed a ban on CIA use of a contingency fund for covert acts and has agreed to wipe away some tortured and legalistic restrictions on coup planning put in place to ensure that the CIA did n't get back in the assassination game .
`` We 've finally been able to convince them that Casey and { Oliver } North do n't work here anymore , '' says one administration official .
The new understanding did n't just spring to life in a spontaneous eruption of sweetness and light .
It emerged after a rancorous display of old-style intelligence politics
that followed this month 's failed coup attempt in Panama .
The White House used television appearances and leaks to argue that congressionally imposed restrictions on covert actions made U.S. support for such coups difficult .
Mr. Bush even disclosed privately that one Reagan-era deal with Congress required him to notify the odious Panamanian dictator , Manuel Noriega , if the U.S. learned of a coup plot
that might endanger his life .
The president also hinted he might veto this year 's intelligence authorization bill if it is too restrictive .
Intelligence Committee Chairman David Boren ( D. , Okla .
) and Vice Chairman William Cohen ( R. , Maine ) , for their part , angrily accused the White House of selectively leaking classified documents and trying unfairly to shift the blame to Congress for the bungled attempt to topple Gen. Noriega .
The White House got the better of the exchange but took care not to press its advantage to the kind of constitutional confrontation sought by conservative Republicans
who do n't want any congressional oversight of intelligence activities .
Instead , Mr. Bush and his aides made it clear they respected Congress 's role and felt they could work with the conservative Mr. Boren and the moderate Mr. Cohen to iron out their differences .
The senators responded in kind .
Sen. Boren happily told reporters that there had been `` a meeting of the minds '' with the White House , and that the committee had given Mr. Bush `` a clean slate , '' free of the impediments imposed during the Reagan years .
Sen. Cohen said the relationship has reverted to its pre-Reagan character .
There still are some details to be nailed down .
Mr. Bush is reserving the right in `` rare '' instances to keep Congress in the dark , asserting a constitutional prerogative
the committee does n't recognize .
And a pending Justice Department interpretation of the assassination ban could raise questions
that would have to be settled .
Moreover , both
sides may face political critics .
Some conservatives will accuse the president of promising Congress too much .
And they continue anonymously attacking CIA Director William Webster for being too accommodating to the committee .
At the same time , some congressional liberals will accuse Sens. Boren and Cohen of wimping out , and they will warn that the lawmakers ' concessions raise the specter of more internationally embarrassing covert operations like the mining of Nicaraguan harbors and the Iran arms sales .
But if the cooperative attitude holds and there is greater consultation on covert activities , the country could be entering an era when such hare-brained schemes are scrapped before they get off the drawing boards , while risky but well-planned secret operations can be undertaken without fear that a panicky Congress will balk .
The Sept. 25 `` Tracking Travel '' column advises readers to `` Charge With Caution When Traveling Abroad '' because credit-card companies charge 1 % to convert foreign-currency expenditures into dollars .
In fact , this is the best bargain available to someone traveling abroad .
In contrast to the 1 % conversion fee charged by Visa , foreign-currency dealers routinely charge 7 % or more to convert U.S. dollars into foreign currency .
On top of this , the traveler
who converts his dollars into foreign currency before the trip starts will lose interest from the day of conversion .
At the end of the trip , any unspent foreign exchange will have to be converted back into dollars , with another commission due .
The card holder will pay the modest 1 % fee only on the amounts actually needed .
Typically , he will be billed only several weeks after the expenditure , and then has another couple of weeks before he has to pay the bill .
In the meantime , the money can continue to earn interest for the card holder -- often more than 1 % during that `` float '' period alone .

Wall Street would like UAL Corp. 's board to change its mind about keeping the company independent .
But what happens next in the continuing takeover drama may depend more on the company 's two most powerful and fractious unions : the pilots and machinists .
Some people familiar with the situation believe that the collapse of the previous $ 6.79 billion buy-out , if anything , may have strengthened the hands of these two labor groups .
As a result , both may now have virtual veto power over any UAL transaction .
One reason : banks -- likely to react to any new UAL deal with even more caution than the first time around -- probably will insist on labor harmony before they agree to put up cash for any new bid or even a less-ambitious recapitalization plan .
`` United pilots have shown on a number of occasions they are willing and able to strike , '' said an executive at Fuji Bank , one of UAL 's large lenders .
`` If you have both
{ labor } groups on strike , you 've got no revenue and that 's a very scary thing for a bank to be looking at .
Just this past week , a leading Japanese bank asked for a meeting with the machinists ' union leaders to determine where the union would stand if another bid or recapitalization became possible .
Another reason : Emboldened by their success in helping to scuttle the previous transaction , the machinists are likely to be more aggressive if a second buy-out attempt occurs .
The two unions already had significant leverage simply because their employer has yet to settle with either on new contracts .
That gives them
both
the threat of a strike and the ability to resist any wage concessions
that may be necessary to make a transaction work .
Thus , even investors
who are pushing for the board to do a recapitalization
that would pay shareholders
a special dividend and possibly grant employees
an ownership stake acknowledge that the unions are key .
`` There
's less likelihood of creating and completing a transaction without the unions ' cooperation and wage concessions , '' said Richard Nye , of Baker , Nye Investments , a New York takeover stock-trader .
Mr. Nye thinks the UAL board should be ousted if it does n't move soon to increase shareholder value .
the pilots and machinists have made it clear that they intend to block any transaction
they do n't like .
`` The pilots will be involved in any transaction
that takes place around here , '' pilot union chairman Frederick C. Dubinsky declared yesterday .
But whether the pilots can team up with their longtime adversaries , the machinists , is another question .
The pilots ' Mr. Dubinsky says his union would like majority ownership for employees .
At the very least , the pilots want some form of control over the airline , perhaps through super-majority voting rights .
On the other hand , the machinists have always opposed majority ownership in principle , saying they do n't think employees should be owners .
Still , in recent days , machinists ' union leaders have shown some new flexibility .
`` We may be able to reach a tradeoff where we can accommodate { the pilot union 's } concerns and ours , '' said Brian M. Freeman , the machinists ' financial adviser .
Mr. Freeman said machinists ' union advisers plan to meet this week to try to draw up a blueprint for some form of recapitalization
that could include a special dividend for shareholders , an employee stake and , perhaps , an equity investment by a friendly investor .
If a compromise ca n't be reached , the pilots maintain they can do a transaction without the support of the machinists .
But at this point , that may just be wishful thinking .
The machinists lobbied heavily against the original bid from UAL pilots and management for the company .
Their opposition helped scare off some Japanese banks .
The pilots ' insistence on majority ownership also may make the idea of a recapitalization difficult to achieve .
`` Who wants to be a public shareholder investing in a company controlled by the pilots ' union ? '' asks Candace Browning , an analyst at Wertheim Schroeder & Co .
`` Who would the board be working for -- the public shareholders or the pilots ? '' she adds .
Ms. Browning says she believes a recapitalization involving employee ownership would succeed only if the pilots relent on their demand for control .
She also notes that even if the pilots accept a minority stake now , they still could come back at a later time and try to take control .
Another possibility is for the pilots ' to team up with an outside investor
who might try to force the ouster of the board through the solicitation of consents .
In that way , the pilots may be able to force the board to approve a recapitalization
that gives employees
a majority stake , or to consider the labor-management group 's latest proposal .
The group did n't make a formal offer , but instead told UAL 's advisers before the most-recent board meeting that it was working on a bid valued at between $ 225 and $ 240
But again , they may need the help of the machinists .
`` I think the dynamics of this situation are that something
's got to happen , '' said one official familiar with the situation .
The board and UAL 's management , he says , `` ca n't go back '' to business as usual .
`` The pilots wo n't let them .
After 20 years of pushing labor proposals to overhaul the nation 's health-care system , Bert Seidman of the AFL-CIO is finding interest from an unlikely quarter : big business .
Corporate leaders , frustrated by double-digit increases in health-care costs , are beginning to sound like liberal Democrats .
Failure to check rising medical costs ultimately could `` lead some of us
today are free-market advocates to re-examine our thinking and positions with respect to government-sponsored national health insurance , '' Arthur Puccini , a General Electric Co. vice president , warned earlier this year .
The pocketbook impact of health benefits has driven business and labor to a surprising consensus .
the AFL-CIO and the National Association of Manufacturers are calling for measures to control rising costs , improve quality and provide care to the 31 million Americans
who currently lack health insurance .
Agreement on these points is a long way from a specific program , and nobody expects the U.S. to rush toward radical restructuring of the health-care system .
But there are signs that labor-management cooperation could change the politics of health-care legislation and the economics of medicine .
`` I ca n't remember a time when virtually everyone can agree on what
the problem is , '' says Mr. Seidman , who heads the AFL-CIO 's department dealing with health matters .
Because the Bush administration is n't taking the initiative on health issues , business executives are dealing with congressional Democrats
who champion health-care revision .
`` Business across the country is spending more time addressing this issue , '' says Sen. Edward Kennedy ( D. , Mass .
`` It 's a bottom-line issue .
'' Business complained earlier this year when Sen. Kennedy introduced a bill
that would require employers to provide a minimum level of health insurance to workers but does n't contain cost-control measures .
Partly in response , a bipartisan group of senators from the finance and labor committees is drafting a plan to attract broader support .
It will feature a cost-containment provision designed to keep expanded benefits from fueling higher care prices .
At 11.1 % of gross national product , U.S. health costs already are the highest in the world .
By contrast , Japan 's equal 6.7 % of GNP , a nation 's total output of goods and services .
Management and labor worry that the gap makes U.S. companies less competitive .
Chrysler Corp. estimates that health costs add $ 700 to the price of each of its cars , about $ 300 to $ 500 more per car than foreign competitors pay for health .
`` The cost of health care is eroding standards of living and sapping industrial strength , '' complains Walter Maher , a Chrysler health-and-benefits specialist .
Labor is upset because many companies are using higher employee insurance premiums , deductibles and co-payments to deflect surging medical costs to workers .
Health benefits are contentious issues in the strikes against Pittston Co. and Nynex Corp .
In their new contract
this year , American Telephone & Telegraph Co. and the Communications Workers of America agreed to look for `` prompt and lasting national solutions '' to rising health-care costs .
Some analysts are cynical about the new corporate interest in health-care overhaul .
Carl Schramm , president of the Health Insurance Association of America , scoffs at `` capitalists
who want to socialize the entire financing system '' for health .
`` They hope they can buy some government cost discipline , '' but this is a false hope , Mr. Schramm says .
He asserts that government has done an even worse job of controlling its health bill than business .
So far neither the Bush administration nor Congress is prepared to lead the way toward revamping health care .
The administration lacks a comprehensive health-care policy .
Congress still is struggling to dismantle the unpopular Catastrophic Care Act of 1988 , which boosted benefits for the elderly and taxed them to pay for the new coverage .
A bipartisan commission established by Congress and headed by Sen. John Rockefeller ( D. , W.Va .
) is scheduled to present new plans for dealing with the uninsured and long-term care for the elderly by next March 1 .
A quadrennial commission appointed by Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan is taking a broad look at the economics of Medicare for the elderly , Medicaid for the poor and the health system in general .
It is expected to report next summer .
`` No magic bullet will be discovered next year , an election year , '' says Rep. Fortney Stark ( D. , Calif .
) But 1991 could be a window for action .
The pressure for change will rise with costs .
`` I think employers are really going to be the ones to push for major change , '' says Sharon Canner , a health expert at NAM .
Any major attempt to revamp the health-care system is likely to trigger opposition from politically powerful interest groups , particularly the American Medical Association , and perhaps from the public as well , if Congress takes steps that patients fear will limit the availability of care .
The NAM embraces efforts , which
the administration and the medical profession have begun , to measure the effectiveness of medical treatments and then to draft medical-practice guidelines .
Advocates hope that such standards will improve treatment while limiting unnecessary tests and medical procedures .
HHS Secretary Sullivan estimates that as much as 25 % of the medical procedures performed each year may be inappropriate or unnecessary .
Limiting care wo n't be easy or popular .
`` To slow the rise in total spending , it will be necessary to reduce per-capita use of services , '' the NAM warns in a policy statement .
This will `` require us to define -- and redefine -- what is ` necessary ' or ` appropriate ' care .
This involves trade-offs and {
it } cuts against the grain of existing consumer and even provider conceptions of what is ` necessary .
The AFL-CIO also embraces treatment guidelines .
In addition , it 's toying with an approach
that would impose health-expenditure ceilings or budgets on the government as a whole and on individual states as a way to slow health-care spending .
At a meeting here on Nov. 15 , the labor federation plans to launch a major effort to build grass-roots support for health-care overhaul .
As a presidential candidate in 1980 , George Bush forthrightly expressed his position on abortion in an interview with Rolling Stone magazine published that March .
What did he think of the Supreme Court 's decision legalizing abortion ?
`` I happen to think it was right , '' Mr. Bush said flatly .
A few months later , Mr. Bush became Ronald Reagan 's running mate .
Suddenly , George Bush
the pro-choice advocate became George Bush
the anti-abortionist .
And the vacillation did n't end there .
Just a month ago , Mr. Bush sternly threatened to veto a pending welfare bill if it provided any abortion funds , except to save a woman 's life .
Then , two weeks ago -- declaring that `` I 'm not looking for any conflict over this '' -- the president said he would consider a compromise to fund abortions for poor women in cases of rape and incest .
But only four days after that , Mr. Bush resurrected the veto threat .
`` I do not support federal funding for abortions except where the mother 's life is threatened , '' he proclaimed , and finally vetoed the measure last weekend .
So what does George Bush really believe ?
The answer is so murky that it is beginning to get this popular president in trouble with each of the increasingly vocal , increasingly powerful sides of the abortion issue .
The result is mistrust and criticism from all around .
Anti-abortion forces regard him as at best an uncertain ally .
`` In all honesty if you ask me , ` Is this man
a true believer ?
' I do n't know , '' says John Fowler , head of the Washington-based Ad Hoc Committee in Defense of Life Inc .
Yet abortion-rights forces remain bitterly critical .
Douglas Gould , vice president of communications for the Planned Parenthood Federation of America , calls Mr. Bush 's position on the abortion-funding issue `` extremely cruel , '' adding : `` The guy has n't done one thing about prevention .
He 's totally geared to a punitive position .
Mr. Bush is plainly uncomfortable with the entire abortion question .
For most of the past nine years , he has striven to convince anti-abortion activists of his stalwart support for their position .
But ever since the Supreme Court 's Webster vs. Reproductive Health Services decision
this year changed the political landscape of the abortion issue , the president seemingly has tried just as hard to avoid saying anything more unless pressed to the wall .
Many Americans still agonize over their own personal feelings about abortion .
Mr. Bush 's problem is n't so much that he seems to be agonizing over the issue as it is that he seems to vacillate on it .
The political risk would be far less if the president drew a firm line and hewed to it , experts insist .
`` If you have a position , you 're better off to stick with it than to move around very much , '' says Republican strategist John Sears .
The need for consistency is especially acute for Mr. Bush , who , Mr. Sears maintains , lacks a strong ideological base .
By his moderate Republican heritage as well as the warnings of political advisers
who say the issue is vital to younger voters , the president might seem to have at least
some sympathy with abortion-rights arguments .
Yet he is also firmly bound by his hard-line rhetoric and promises he made to anti-abortion activists during his long pursuit of the White House .
On many issues -- flag-burning , for instance -- his keen political sensitivities overcome such conflicts .
But Mr. Bush and his advisers miscalculated the politics of the abortion issue , failing to grasp how dramatically the abortion-rights movement would be aroused following last summer 's Supreme Court decision to restrict those rights in the Webster case .
`` It was one of the quickest changes in public attitudes I 've ever seen , '' says former Reagan pollster Richard Wirthlin .
These days , when others raise the subject of abortion , the usually loquacious president can be close-mouthed almost to the point of curtness .
Ten days ago he was asked to amplify the reasons behind his anti-abortion stance .
`` My position is well-known and well-stated , '' he replied .
A close look at his record over the last 15 years suggests that Mr. Bush has well-stated his views -- on all sides of the issue .
In 1974 , as the U.S. representative to the United Nations , he wrote an introduction to a book on world population in which
he boasted of his leadership during his term in Congress in expanding family-planning services for the poor .
Running for president in early 1980 , he was also quoted as supporting federal funding for abortions in cases of rape , incest and to save the life of the mother .
In his Rolling Stone interview in 1980 , Mr. Bush volunteered his abortion-rights remarks to contrast himself with his rival , Ronald Reagan .
In addition to supporting the landmark Roe vs. Wade Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion , Mr. Bush said he opposed the constitutional ban on abortion that Mr. Reagan was promising to promote .
As Mr. Reagan 's running mate , though , Mr. Bush plunged headlong into the anti-abortion position , endorsing a constitutional amendment outlawing abortion .
He acknowledged only one difference with Mr. Reagan -- that the amendment ought to have exceptions for rape and incest as well as to save a woman 's life .
Throughout the early 1980s , Mr. Bush was quoted sometimes supporting federal funding for abortion in cases of rape and incest and sometimes opposing it .
In April 1986 , then-Vice President Bush had his staff write a letter spelling out that he would support a constitutional amendment banning abortions except in cases of rape , incest and life endangerment , but that he opposed federal funding in all but the latter case .
At the GOP convention last year , he again came out for an amendment with exceptions for rape , incest and life endangerment .
His rhetoric gathered momentum as he rolled into office , affirming his `` firm support of our cause '' during an anti-abortion rally three days after his inauguration last January .
He again urged passage of a constitutional amendment outlawing abortion .
But when the high court ruled in the Webster case in July , the president began to lower the volume .
When the ruling was handed down , the vacationing president dispatched Chief of Staff John Sununu to issue a statement and refused to answer questions
himself .
He did later threaten vetoes over legislation restoring the District of Columbia 's right to use its own tax money to fund abortions for poor women and over restoring funding to the United Nations Population Fund .
But in the months since then , while trying to drum up support for other issues -- such as an anti-flag-burning constitutional amendment -- he has shied away from talking about abortion .
What
few comments
he has initiated have been oblique , such as urging `` greater efforts toward the protection of human life '' at a meeting of Catholic lawyers in Boston last month .
The White House has likewise avoided any involvement in Florida 's recent special legislative session on abortion , which anti-abortion forces had regarded as a key test of their ability to get state lawmakers to toughen abortion restrictions .
The session failed to enact any new curbs .
Now , some see Mr. Bush trapped in a position
he is neither comfortable with nor able to escape .
Ken Ruberg , head of the Republican Mainstream Committee , a group of party moderates , observes : `` The administration finds itself in an ideological cul de sac that it will find it difficult -- if not impossible -- to get itself out of .
Everything looked good as neurosurgeon Walter Levy and colleagues carefully cut away a woman 's spinal tumor at the Cleveland Clinic in 1978 .
Using small electrical shocks applied to her feet , they were able to monitor sensory nerves .
The shocks generated nerve impulses
that traveled via spine to brain and showed up clearly on a brain-wave monitor , indicating no damage to the delicate spinal tissue .
Then , says Dr. Levy , `` she woke up paralyzed .
The damage was to her motor nerves , which could n't be monitored along with the sensory nerves , he explains .
The tragedy , he adds , `` galvanized me '' to look for a way to prevent similar cases .
Dr. Levy 's answer may come with a new kind of magnetic brain probe , a device that he and dozens of U.S. researchers are studying with great hope .
Besides holding the promise of safer spinal surgery , the probe could improve the diagnosis of brain and nerve disorders such as strokes and multiple sclerosis .
Perhaps most exciting , the device is thrusting open a window to the workings of the brain .
The probe , which is painless , non-invasive and apparently harmless , employs strong magnetic fields to induce small whirlwinds of electricity within the brain .
If positioned over the brain 's motor-control area , the hand-held electromagnets generate nerve impulses
that zip down motor nerves and activate muscles , making , say , a finger twitch .
In principle , they will enable doctors to check the body 's motor system
the way
an electrician tests a home 's electrical circuits by running current through them .
`` Until now , we 've had no objective way of measuring motor function , '' says Keith Chiappa , a neurologist conducting clinical tests with the devices at Boston 's Massachusetts General Hospital .
`` All
we could do was tell a patient , ` squeeze my fingers as hard as you can ' or ` raise your arm .
' `` Under the best circumstances such tests are subjective ; when a patient is unconscious , they do n't work at all .
Magnetic brain tweaking started in the early 1900s , when researchers produced flashes of light in the visual field with magnets .
In the 1960s , Mayo Clinic researchers developed magnetic devices to stimulate motor nerves in the hand and other limbs .
But for brain tests , the unwieldy machines `` would have required patients to stand on their heads , '' says Reginald Bickford , a researcher at the University of California at San Diego .
The field took off in 1985 after scientists at Britain 's Sheffield University developed a handy , compact magnet for brain stimulation .
Since then , at least two commercial versions have been put on the U.S. market , and an estimated 500 have been sold .
In August , a Chicago conference on such devices attracted more than 100 researchers , who reported studies on everything from brain mapping to physical therapy .
`` We do n't feel we can use { the devices } routinely in surgery yet , but we 're getting close , '' says Dr. Levy , who is now with the University of Pittsburgh .
A problem , he adds , is that anesthetized brains are more resistant to magnetic stimulation than awake ones .
The devices could help indicate when surgery would help , says Charles Tator , a University of Toronto neurosurgeon .
For example , paralyzed car-crash victims occasionally have some intact spinal tissues that , if preserved by emergency surgery , enable partial recovery .
But such operations typically are n't performed because there is no sign right after an injury
that surgery would be beneficial .
`` The cost { of magnetic stimulators } would seem like peanuts if we could retrieve limb function '' in such people , Dr. Tator says .
Scientists caution there is a chance
the magnet technique might spark seizures in epileptics .
But no significant problems have been reported among hundreds of people tested with the devices .
The main sensation , besides feeling like a puppet jerked with invisible strings , is `` like a rap on the head , '' says Sam Bridgers , a neurologist
who has studied the brain stimulators at Yale University .
One apparent side effect is a minor increase in a brain hormone .
And some doctors
who have conducted hours of tests on themselves report temporary headaches .
At least two companies , Cadwell Laboratories Inc. of Kennewick , Wash. , and Novametrix Medical Systems Inc. of Wallingford , Conn. , now sell versions of the magnetic devices .
The machines , which at $ 12,500 are inexpensive by medical standards , have n't been approved in the U.S. for marketing as brain stimulators but are sold for stimulating nerves in the hand , legs and other non-brain areas .
Researchers can apply for permission to use the probes for brain studies .
At the University of Kentucky , a team led by Dean Currier , a physical therapy researcher , is testing the stimulators in conjunction with electric shocks to induce muscle contractions to help prevent wasting of thigh muscles after knee surgery .
Similarly , a Purdue University team led by heart researcher W.A. Tacker hopes to develop ways to magnetically induce cardiac muscle contractions .
The devices might someday serve as temporary pacemakers or restarters for stopped hearts , says Dr. Tacker , whose prototype was dubbed the `` Tacker whacker .
The devices ' most remarkable possibilities , though , involve the brain .
Probing with the stimulators , National Institutes of Health scientists recently showed how the brain reorganizes motor-control resources after an amputation .
Similar studies are expected to reveal how stroke patients ' brains regroup -- a first step toward finding ways to bolster that process and speed rehabilitation .
Scientists also are exploring memory and perception with the new machines .
At the State University of New York at Brooklyn , researchers flash two groups of different letters on a computer screen in front of human guinea pigs .
Between flashes , certain areas in subjects ' brains are jolted with a magnetic stimulator .
When the jolt is timed just right , the subjects do n't recall seeing the first group of letters .
`` Where does that first stimulus go ? '' exclaims SUNY neurologist Paul Maccabee .
`` Trying to answer that is suggesting all kinds of theories , '' such as precisely where and how the brain processes incoming signals from the eyes .
He and others say that the machines are weak enough that they do n't jeopardize the memory .
the SUNY team and researchers at the National Magnet Laboratory in Cambridge , Mass. , are working with more potent magnetic brain stimulators .
Among other things , the stronger devices may be able to summon forth half-forgotten memories and induce mood changes , neurologists say .
The portfolio unit of the French bank group Credit Lyonnais told stock market regulators that it bought 43,000 shares of Cie. de Navigation Mixte , apparently to help fend off an unwelcome takeover bid for the company .
Earlier yesterday , the Societe de Bourses Francaises was told that a unit of Framatome S.A. also bought Navigation Mixte shares , this purchase covering more than 160,000 shares .
companies are allies of Navigation Mixte in its fight against a hostile takeover bid launched last week by Cie .
Financiere de Paribas at 1,850 French francs ( $ 297 ) a share .
Navigation Mixte 's chairman had suggested that friendly institutions were likely to buy its stock as soon as trading opened Monday .
The Credit Lyonnais purchase , for 33,000 regular common shares and 10,000 newly created shares , is valued at about slightly more than 80 million French francs .
Canada 's consumer price index rose a seasonally adjusted 0.2 % in September from August , Statistics Canada , a federal agency , said .
The rise followed boosts of 0.1 % in August , 0.7 % in July and 0.6 % in June .
New orders for durable goods fell back slightly in September after shooting up the month before , reflecting weakening auto demand after a spurt of orders for new 1990 models , the Commerce Department reported .
Orders for military equipment , household appliances , machinery and other goods expected to last at least three years dipped 0.1 % last month , to $ 126.68 billion , after leaping 3.9 % in August , the department said .
Most analysts had expected a sharper decline after the steep rise in August .
Moreover , a recent government report showing widespread layoffs in manufacturing had contributed to perceptions that the manufacturing sector of the economy had slowed to a crawl .
But many economists pointed to a 1.8 % September rise in orders outside the volatile transportation category .
That `` suggests the manufacturing sector is not falling apart , '' said Sally Kleinman , an economist at Manufacturers Hanover Securities Corp. in New York .
She added , however : `` It is not robust by any means .
While a decline in orders for cars and civilian airplanes pulled down the orders total , an enormous jump in orders for heavy military equipment propped it up .
Orders for capital defense goods skyrocketed 56 % , and a government analyst said nearly all areas saw increases , including airplanes , missiles , ships , tanks and communications equipment .
Orders for military goods usually catapult in September , government officials say , as the Pentagon scrambles to spend its money before the new fiscal year begins Oct. 1 .
While all the numbers in the durable goods report were adjusted for seasonal fluctuations , a Commerce Department analyst said that the adjustment probably did n't factor out all of the wide-ranging surge in defense orders .
Without the increase in defense bookings , September orders would have plummeted 3.9 % .
Analysts were most unsettled by evidence
the backlog of orders at factories is slipping .
Unfilled orders for durable goods rose 0.4 % in September , to $ 476.14 billion , after declining for the first time in 2 1\/2 years in August .
In July unfilled orders grew 1 % .
But analysts noted that excluding transportation - where
they believe was a temporary surge in auto demand pushed up the figures - order backlogs have declined for three months in a row .
`` It means we 're eating into the bread
that keeps us going .
That is a little disturbing , '' Ms. Kleinman said .
`` It also means if you have a real drop-off in orders , production will likely fall off very quickly because there is less to keep things going .
Capital goods orders outside of the defense sector tumbled for the second month in a row , posting a 5.6 % drop after a 10.3 % decline .
Such steep drops in a category seen as a barometer of business investment would customarily be grave news for the economy .
But a Commerce Department analyst said that in both
months orders would have risen had it not been for a drop in civilian aircraft bookings , a category
that is showing declines only after a huge surge earlier this year .
Still , Milton Hudson , senior economic adviser at Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. in New York , said : `` If you look back a half-year or so the evidence was pretty good of affirmative strength in the capital-goods sector .
Now at least
there are question marks about that , and without any question
the pace of growth has slowed .
Medieval philosophers used to hold the sensible belief that it was more perfect to exist than not to exist , and that to exist as a matter of necessity was most perfect of all .
Now , only God exists as a matter of absolute necessity ; it is built into His nature .
But since the time of Darwin , we
humans could at least claim
a sort of natural necessity for the existence of our species .
Are n't we , after all , the inevitable culmination of that stately pageant called evolution ?
If mutation and natural selection slowly but surely give rise to more and more advanced forms of life , then it was only a matter of eons before splendid beings endowed with reason , self-awareness and taste shimmered onto the scene .
Now along comes Stephen Jay Gould to dash this flattering illusion .
His credentials are excellent for the task .
Star lecturer at Harvard , author of numerous popular books on science , and scourge of the creationist lobby , Mr. Gould is perhaps the world 's most eminent evolutionary theorist .
Yet he puts quite a twist on the old story handed down from Darwin .
For him , natural history is anything but a gradual , predictable march from primordial slime to human consciousness ; it is a careening , chaotic affair in which
the emergence of a featherless biped was a one-in-a-million shot .
In `` Wonderful Life : The Burgess Shale and the Nature of History '' ( Norton , 326 pages , $ 19.95 ) , Mr. Gould makes his case for `` the awesome improbability of human evolution .
'' The argument turns on the discovery in 1909 of an amazing fossil quarry high in the Canadian Rockies called the Burgess Shale .
Here , in an area smaller than a city block , lay buried traces of countless weird creatures
that had frolicked more than 500 million years ago -- creatures whose anatomical variety far exceeded what can be found in all the world 's oceans today .
Such an embarrassment of riches was inconceivable to the man
who discovered the Burgess Shale , one Charles Doolittle Walcott .
The received Darwinian wisdom of the day said that animals living so long ago must be simple in design , limited in scope and ancestral to contemporary species .
Accordingly , the hidebound traditionalist reconstructed hypothetical organisms from the Burgess fossils in such a way that they could be shoehorned into familiar categories .
It was not until the early 1970s that Cambridge Prof. Harry Whittington and two sharp graduate students began to publish a reinterpretation of the Burgess Shale .
By making clever inferences about how the squashed and distorted fossil remains corresponded to three-dimensional structures , this trio was able to piece together a series of wondrous beasties quite unlike anything currently on the planet .
One was so fantastic in appearance , it was dubbed Hallucigenia .
Would that Mr. Gould 's minute descriptions of these creatures was always so colorful .
A good deal of the book is boring , particularly the endless allusions to high and pop culture and the frequent jokes festooning the text .
These turns do not provide sufficient relief from sentences like , `` Most modern chelicerates have six uniramous appendages on the prosoma .
Interest picks up , though , when Mr. Gould gets around to discussing the meaning of the Burgess oddities for the theory of evolution .
Not long after the appearance of life , evidently , there was an explosive proliferation in the number of animal designs seen on the earth .
The vast majority of them , however , were wiped out by a succession of environmental upheavals
that were too sudden and catastrophic for the normal rules of natural selection to operate .
Consequently , the winnowing process was like a lottery `` in which
each group { held } a ticket unrelated to its anatomical virtues .
'' So much for survival of the fittest .
So much , too , for the notion that we
humans triumphed in the Darwinian struggle by evolving big brains .
Our mammalian forerunners lucked out through the extraterrestrial impact
that did in the dinosaurs because they were small , not smart .
If anyone has difficulty imagining a world in which history went merrily on without us , Mr. Gould sketches several .
In one , birds are the dominant carnivores ; in another the seas abound with `` little penises .
Back when the Burgess fauna were flourishing , it seems , human evolutionary hopes hung on the survival of a little worm with a backbone called Pikaia .
Mr. Gould finds this oddly exhilarating ; like an existentialist of old , he views our contingency as `` a source of both freedom and consequent moral responsibility .
'' I , by contrast , can not help feeling that if some other curiosity from the Burgess Shale had survived instead , beings at once wiser and less boorish than Homo sapiens might have eventually gained earthly dominion .
But even if no conscious life had evolved here at all , the universe is a big place , and given the right conditions , sympathetic to creating some form of life .
Surely at some other cosmic address
a Gouldoid creature would have risen out of the ooze to explain why , paleontologically speaking , `` it is , indeed , a wonderful life .
Mr. Holt is a columnist for the Literary Review in London .
James River Corp. , Richmond , Va. , said it acquired the tissue operations of Buhrmann-Tetterode N.V. of the Netherlands for about $ 77 million .
The Dutch unit , known as Celtona B.V. , is a leading maker of consumer and away-from-home tissue products for the Benelux region .
In addition , the acquisition includes production assets of Invercon Papermils , a maker of household tissue products for the U.K. and Ireland .
The combined operations had 1988 revenue of about $ 100 million .
James River , a maker of pulp , paper and plastic products , already has interests in tissue businesses in France , Spain , Italy and Turkey .
The company said it plans to form European ventures with Italian and Finnish companies .
The Celtona operations would become part of those ventures .
Allergan Inc. said it received Food and Drug Administration approval to sell the PhacoFlex intraocular lens , the first foldable silicone lens available for cataract surgery .
The len 's foldability enables it to be inserted in smaller incisions than are now possible for cataract surgery , the eye care and skin care concern said .
Cataracts refer to a clouding of the eye 's natural lens .
Allergan was spun off in July from SmithKline Beckman Corp. as part of the merger of SmithKline and Beecham
Group
Esselte AB , the Stockholm office supplies company , as expected , proposed to acquire the 22 %
it does n't own of its U.S. unit , Esselte Business Systems Inc .
The price in the proposal is $ 43.50 for each of the 4.9 million shares
the parent does n't own , or $ 213.2 million .
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading , Esselte closed yesterday at $ 43.50
a share , up $ 1 .
A committee of outside directors for the Garden City , N.Y. , unit is evaluating the proposal ; the parent asked it to respond by Oct. 31 .
The unit said it can provide no assurance
a transaction will occur .
Esselte AB sold the minority stake five years ago in a $ 40 million international share offering .
The unit , which is the holding company for Esselte 's non-Swedish units , accounted for 58 % of sales and 71 % of operating profit last year .
Separately , Esselte Business Systems reported third-quarter net income fell 5.9 % to $ 9.5 million , or 46 cents
a share , from $ 10.1 million , or 49 cents
a share , in the year-ago period .
Sales rose 2.9 % to $ 329.2 million from $ 320 million .
Shareholders of Nuovo Banco Ambrosiano S.p.A. voted to accept a bid of 5,500 lire ( $ 4.03 ) a share by France 's Credit Agricole for 13.32 % of the bank , rejecting an earlier , equal offer by Italy 's Assicurazioni Generali S.p.A .
The move will give Nuovo Banco
a badly needed foreign presence , and make Credit Agricole
the bank 's largest shareholder .
It also opens a rift in the bank 's shareholders ' syndicate
that could lead to a battle for control of the concern .
Nuovo Banco will become Italy 's biggest private-sector bank when it completes its scheduled merger with Banca Cattolica
del Venetoen by year end .
Credit Agricole asked a Milan court to sequester the Nuovo Banco shares , the Italian news agency ANSA reported .
The tribunal is scheduled to rule on the request Friday .
No reason for the request was given .
Credit Agricole officials could n't be immediately reached for comment .
The decision to accept Credit Agricole 's bid , valued at 283.3 billion lire ( $ 207.4 million ) , came after a stormy weekend meeting .
Nuovo Banco 's second largest shareholder , the Fiat S.p.A.-controlled investment concern , Gemina S.p.A. , fought to have Generali 's offer approved .
Gemina , which owns 13.26 % of Nuovo Banco , abstained in the final vote on Credit Agricole , which was nonetheless approved by a majority of shareholders .
The linkup with Credit Agricole will give Nuovo Banco its first foreign presence since it was formed from the wreck of the old Banco Ambrosiano , which collapsed amid scandal after the death of Chairman Roberto Calvi in 1982 .
Since then , the bank has strengthened its Italian network , and has posted strong results .
`` The shareholders felt we needed a foreign presence more than we needed links with an insurance company , '' an Ambrosiano spokeswoman said .
Gemina said in a statement that `` it reserves the right to take any action to protect its rights as a member of the syndicate .
'' A company spokeswoman said the company had n't decided what measures to take , but did n't rule out legal action .
Generali , Italy 's biggest insurer , last month offered 5,500 lire
a share for the Nuovo Banco stake held by Banco Popolare di Milano , the bank 's largest shareholder , which announced plans to sell the holdings earlier this year .
A Generali spokesman declined to comment on Nuovo Banco 's rejection of the insurer 's offer .
On the Milan stock exchange , Nuovo Banco 's shares jumped to 4,830 lire
each from 4,695 lire Friday .
Mercedes-Benz of North America Inc. , Grosse Pointe Shores , Mich. , estimated it will sell about as many cars in 1990 as the 75,000 it expects to deliver this year .
Mercedes officials said they expect flat sales next year even though they see the U.S. luxury-car market expanding slightly .
Erich Krampe , president of the U.S. sales arm of West German auto maker Daimler Benz AG , predicted luxury-car sales will rise to 840,000 in 1990 from 830,000 this year primarily because of the new Japanese makes .
Most of the growth , he said , will come in the $ 35,000-to-$50,000 price range , where Mercedes has a 35 % U.S. market share .
Mercedes sold 82,348 cars in 1988 .
Mr. Krampe also said that Mercedes plans to bring out new models
every year through the mid-1990s and it will shorten its product development cycle to eight years from 10 or 12 years to compete more effectively with Toyota Motor Corp. 's Lexus , Nissan Motor Co. 's Infiniti and Honda Motor Co. 's Acura luxury-car divisions .
Environmental Control Group Inc. said it expects to report `` minimal '' earnings or a loss for the third quarter .
The environmental services company said that the discontinuation of unsuccessful product lines and an increase in baddebt reserves probably will result in charges of $ 2.5 million to $ 4 million , most of which will be taken against third-quarter results .
In the year-ago quarter , the company reported earnings of $ 2.2 million , or 35 cents
a share .
Investors ran away from the stock market yesterday , dumping many recently favored stocks as they fled .
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 39.55 to 2613.73 .
New York Stock Exchange volume rose to 175,240,000 shares from 155.6 million Wednesday .
Badly shaken by recent big swings in stock prices and the cloudy outlook for the economy , investors sold many of the consumer-oriented blue chips
that were the market 's star performers only a week ago .
Many of those issues-such as Philip Morris , Procter & Gamble and Merck -- are in the Dow Jones Industrial Average .
Traders said investors were either raising cash or buying very selectively .
In a sign of just how nervous investors are , precious-metals stocks were among the best performers yesterday .
Compaq Computer 's disappointing earnings report after the market closed Wednesday set the pace for the sell-off yesterday .
Compaq closed down 8 5\/8 to 100 on 2.6 million shares .
Compaq , a highly sought stock only a few days ago , hit a record high of 112 1\/2 on Oct. 19 .
Third-quarter earnings were on the low end of analysts ' forecasts , and the company disclosed that it had uncovered two technical flaws in Intel 's new microprocessor , which could cause delays in shipments of some new Compaq products .
Intel dropped 7\/8 to 32 in over-the-counter trading .
`` When you see what happened to Compaq , it is completely ( numbing ) for the mentality of the market , '' said Jack Solomon , technical analyst for Bear Stearns .
`` It is hard for the mind to digest that what was the leading stock is now the one leading you down the tubes .
Investors took little comfort in yesterday 's report that third-quarter gross national product grew at a 2.5 % annual rate .
Though that growth was in line with expectations , investors focused on signs of a slowdown : a buildup in inventories and dubious strength in consumer spending .
Futures-related selling pushed the industrial average about 45 points lower in the morning as rumors about RJR Nabisco 's pending sale of its Del Monte foods unit spread through the trading pits in Chicago .
The purchase of Del Monte is likely to be financed with junk bonds or a bridge loan .
The stock market has had a heightened concern about turmoil with high-risk financing ever since Campeau Corp. nearly missed an interest payment on its junk bonds in September .
While futures-related sell programs depressed prices at first , buy programs pared the industrial average 's losses later in the session .
However , Donald Selkin , head of futures research at Prudential-Bache Securities , said that the stock market appears to be poised for a round of futures-related selling this morning , given the discrepancies between futures and stocks at the close .
The New York Stock Exchange started trading its new `` basket '' product yesterday , with which institutions can buy and sell all the stocks in the Standard & Poor 's 500-stock index in one trade .
About $ 45 million of stock traded through the basket .
In a sign of the credit needs among market makers during the 190-point plunge on Oct. 13 , the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said yesterday that loans by New York 's nine largest banks for the financing of securities positions rose $ 786 million , to $ 6.6 billion during the week ending Oct. 18 .

it expects to affect results through the end of 1990 .
Philip Morris fell 1 7\/8 to 41 5\/8 on 3.7 million shares , reflecting the possibility that Anheuser-Busch 's decision could have a negative impact on results at its Miller Brewing unit .
Other consumer stocks coming under selling pressure included Procter & Gamble , which went down 3 1\/4 to 126 3\/4 ; Coca-Cola Co. , down 1 3\/8 to 71 1\/8 , McDonald 's , down 1\/4 to 31 1\/4 ; PepsiCo , off 1 to 60 3\/8 , and Merck , down 1 1\/2 to 76 3\/4 .

Telerate , which said it is holding talks with Dow Jones about the latter 's $ 18-a-share takeover offer , advanced 7\/8 to 20 1\/2 .
Earlier this month , a special committee of Telerate 's board rejected the bid as inadequate .
The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index fell 2.44 to 373.48 .
Volume totaled 12,190,000 shares .
La Jolla Bancorp climbed 3 to 13 .
Security Pacific signed a letter of intent to acquire the company in a stock swap valued at $ 15
a share .
Unisys Corp. 's announcement Friday of a $ 648.2 million loss for the third quarter showed that the company is moving even faster than expected to take write-offs on its various problems and prepare for a turnaround next year .
At the same time , the sheer size of the loss , coupled with a slowing of orders , made some securities analysts wonder just how strong
that turnaround will be at the computer maker and defense-electronics concern .
`` Unisys is getting clobbered .
Just clobbered , '' said Ulric Weil , an analyst at Weil & Associates
who had once been high on the company .
`` The quarter was terrible , and the future looks anything but encouraging .
Unisys , whose revenue inched up 3.7 % in the quarter to $ 2.35 billion from $ 2.27 billion in the year-earlier quarter , had an operating loss of about $ 30 million .
On top of that , the Blue Bell , Pa. , concern took a $ 230 million charge related to the layoffs of 8,000 employees .
That is at the high end of the range of 7,000 to 8,000 employees that Unisys said a month ago would be laid off .
Unisys said that should help it save $ 500 million
a year in costs , again at the high end of the previously reported range of $ 400 million to $ 500 million .
The company also took a write-off of $ 150 million to cover losses on some fixed-price defense contracts , as some new managers took a hard look at the prospects for that slow-growing business .
In addition , Unisys set up an unspecified reserve -- apparently $ 60 million to $ 70 million -- to cover the minimum amount
it will have to pay the government because of its involvement in the defense-procurement scandal .
Unisys also noted that it paid $ 78.8 million in taxes during the quarter , even though tax payments normally would be minimal in a quarter
that produced such a big loss .
The tax payments will leave Unisys with $ 225 million in loss carry-forwards
that will cut tax payments in future quarters .
In addition , Unisys said it reduced computer inventories a further $ 100 million during the quarter , leaving it within $ 100 million of its goal of a reduction of $ 500 million by the end of the year .
Still , Unisys said its European business was weak during the quarter , a worrisome sign given that the company has relied on solid results overseas to overcome weakness in the U.S. over the past several quarters .
The company also reported slower growth in another important business : systems
that use the Unix operating system .
That would be a huge problem if it were to continue , because Unisys is betting its business on the assumption that customers want to move away from using operating systems
that run on only one manufacturer 's equipment and toward systems -- mainly Unix -- that work on almost anyone
's machines .
In addition , Unisys must deal with its increasingly oppressive debt load .
Debt has risen to around $ 4 billion , or about 50 % of total capitalization .
That means Unisys must pay about $ 100 million in interest
every quarter , on top of $ 27 million in dividends on preferred stock .
Jim Unruh , Unisys 's president , said he is approaching next year with caution .
He said the strength of the world-wide economy is suspect , and does n't see much revenue growth in the cards .
He also said that the price wars flaring up in parts of the computer industry will continue through next year .
He said the move toward standard operating systems means customers are n't locked into buying from their traditional computer supplier and can force prices down .
That , he said , is why Unisys is overhauling its whole business : It needs to prepare for a world in which profit margins will be lower than computer companies have been used to .
`` We 've approached this not as a response to a temporary condition in the industry but as a fundamental change
the industry is going through , '' Mr. Unruh said .
`` The information-systems industry is still going to be a high-growth business , and we 're confident that we have tremendous assets as a company .
But we do n't minimize the challenges of the near term .
Securities analysts were even more cautious , having been burned repeatedly on Unisys
Some had predicted earnings of more than $ 4
a share for this year , up from last year 's fully diluted $ 3.27
a share on earnings of $ 680.6 million .
But the company said Friday that it had losses of $ 673.3 million through the first nine months , compared with earnings
a year earlier of $ 382.2 million , or $ 2.22
a share fully diluted , as revenue inched up 1.4 % to $ 7.13 billion from $ 7.03 billion .
And Unisys is expected to do little better than break even in the fourth quarter .
So Steve Milunovich at First Boston said he is cutting his earnings estimate for next year to $ 2
a share from $ 3 .
`` I was feeling like I was too high to begin with , '' he said .
Mr. Weil of Weil & Associates said he will remain at $ 1
a share for next year but said he wonders whether even that low target is at risk .
`` The break-even point for next year is much lower , but is it low enough ? '' he asked .
Reflecting the concern , Unisys stock fell a further 75 cents to $ 16.25 in composite trading Friday on the New York Stock Exchange .
For Cathay Pacific Airways , the smooth ride may be ending .
The first signs of trouble came last month when the Hong Kong carrier , a subsidiary of Swire Pacific Ltd. , posted a 5 % drop in operating profit for the first six months and warned that margins will remain under pressure for the rest of the year .
Securities analysts , many of whom scrapped their buy recommendations after seeing Cathay 's interim figures , believe more jolts lie ahead .
Fuel and personnel costs are rising , and tourism in and through Hong Kong remains clouded by China 's turmoil since the June 4 killings in Beijing .
In addition , delivery delays for the first two of as many as 28 Boeing 747-400s that the carrier has ordered have raised costs because personnel had been hired to man
the planes .
And tough competition in the air-freight market is cutting into an important sideline .
There also is concern that once Hong Kong reverts to China 's sovereignty in 1997 , Cathay will be forced to play second fiddle to China 's often-disparaged flag carrier , Civil Aviation Administration of China , or CAAC .
`` The sense is we would never be in a position again where everything works for us
it did before , '' says Rod Eddington , Cathay 's commercial director .
Sarah Hall , an analyst at James Capel ( Far East ) Ltd. , says there is n't much Cathay can do about rising costs for jet fuel , Hong Kong 's tight labor market , or the strengthening of the local currency , which is pegged to the U.S. dollar .
These factors are further complicated by the airline 's push to transform itself from a regional carrier to an international one , Ms. Hall says .
Ms. Hall expects Cathay 's profit to grow around 13 % annually this year and next .
In 1988 , it earned $ 2.82 billion Hong Kong ( US$ 361.5 million ) on revenue of HK$ 11.79 billion .
Cathay is taking several steps to bolster business .
One step is to beef up its fleet .
In addition to aircraft from Boeing Co. , Cathay announced earlier this year
an order for as many as 20 Airbus A330-300s .
The expansion , which could cost as much as US$ 5.7 billion over the next eight years , will expand the fleet to about 43 planes by 1991 , up from 30 at the end of last year , according to Sun Hung Kai Securities Ltd .
The fuel-efficient Airbus planes will be used largely to replace Cathay 's aging fleet of Lockheed Tristars for regional flights , while the Boeing aircraft will be used on long-haul routes to Europe and North America .
Cathay also is moving some of its labor-intensive data-processing operations outside Hong Kong .
Fierce bidding for young employees in Hong Kong is pushing up Cathay 's labor costs by 20 %
a year for low-level staff , while experienced , skilled employees are leaving the colony as part of the brain drain .
Some jobs already have been moved to Australia , and there are plans to place others in Canada .
David Bell , a spokesman for the airline , says the move is partly aimed at retaining existing staff
who are leaving to secure foreign passports ahead of 1997 .
Cathay is working to promote Hong Kong as a destination worth visiting on its own merits , rather than just a stopover .
Although the June 4 killings in Beijing have hurt its China flights , Cathay 's other routes have retained high load factors .
Mr. Eddington regards promoting Hong Kong as an important part of attracting visitors from Japan , South Korea and Taiwan , where the number of people looking to travel abroad has surged .
There also has been speculation that Cathay will be among the major private-sector participants in the Hong Kong government 's plans to build a new airport , with the carrier possibly investing in its own terminal .
Cathay officials decline to comment on the speculation .
Mr. Eddington sees alliances with other carriers -- particularly Cathay 's recent link with AMR Corp. 's American Airlines -- as an important part of Cathay 's strategy .
But he emphasizes that Cathay has n't any interest in swapping equity stakes with the U.S. carrier or with Lufthansa , the West German airline with which
it has cooperated for about a decade .
Analysts believe Cathay is approached for such swaps by other carriers on a regular basis , particularly as the popularity of share exchanges has grown among European carriers .
`` We think alliances are very important , '' Mr. Eddington says .
`` But we 'd rather put funds into our own business rather than someone else 's .
I 'm not sure cross-ownership would necessarily make things smoother .
In a pattern
it aims to copy in several key U.S. destinations , Cathay recently announced plans to serve San Francisco by flying into American Airlines ' Los Angeles hub and routing continuing passengers onto a flight on the U.S. carrier .
`` We 'll never have a big operation in the U.S. , and they 'll never have one as big as us in the Pacific , '' Mr. Eddington says .
`` But this way , American will coordinate good extensions to Boston , New York , Chicago and Dallas .
We 'll coordinate on this end to places like Bangkok , Singapore and Manila .
Asian traffic , which currently accounts for 65 % of Cathay 's business , is expected to continue as the carrier 's mainstay .
Cathay has long stated its desire to double its weekly flights into China to 14 , and it is applying to restart long-canceled flights into Vietnam .
Further expansion into southern Europe is also possible , says Mr. Bell , the spokesman .
While a large number of Hong Kong companies have reincorporated offshore ahead of 1997 , such a move is n't an option for Cathay because it would jeopardize its landing rights in Hong Kong .
And Mr. Eddington emphatically rules out a move to London : `` Our lifeblood is Hong Kong traffic rights .
He says the airline is putting its faith in the Sino-British agreement on Hong Kong 's return to China .
A special section dealing with aviation rights states that landing rights for Hong Kong 's airlines , which include the smaller Hong Kong Dragon Airlines , will continue to be negotiated by Hong Kong 's government .
But critics fret that post-1997 officials ultimately will be responsible to Beijing .
`` My feeling is { Cathay does n't } have a hope in the long run , '' says an analyst , who declines to be identified .
`` Cathay would love to keep going , but the general sense is they 're going to have to do something .
Mr. Eddington acknowledges that the carrier will have to evolve and adapt to local changes , but he feels that the Sino-British agreement is firm ground to build on for the foreseeable future .
`` We 're confident that it protects our route structure , '' he says , `` and our ability to grow and prosper .
Gov. George Deukmejian and key legislators agreed to back a temporary one-quarter-cent increase in the state sales tax to raise $ 800 million for repairs and relief associated with last month 's earthquake .
The tax increase , which will be considered at a special session of the state legislature
that begins tomorrow , would cover only part of the estimated $ 4 billion to $ 6 billion in total damage caused by the Oct. 17 quake .
Aside from as much as $ 3.45 billion in recently approved federal aid , the state is expected to draw from a gubernatorial emergency fund
that currently stands at an estimated $ 700 million .
`` I am not aware that there is anything but bipartisan agreement for the general outline '' of the revenue-raising plan , said a spokesman for the governor , after a Monday meeting with legislative leaders over the quake-relief question .
The tax increase -- on top of the current six-cent per dollar sales tax -- would become effective
this Dec. 1 and expire Dec. 31 , 1990 .
The sales-tax plan was preferred over an alternative
that would have boosted the state gasoline tax .
Some legislators expressed concern that a gas-tax increase would take too long and possibly damage chances of a major gas-tax-increasing ballot initiative that voters will consider next June .
Troubled SCI Television Inc. proposed to restructure much of its $ 1.3 billion in debt to buy time to sell assets and pay its obligations .
The leveraged buy-out firm of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. , which owns 46 % of the common equity of SCI TV , indicated in the debt plan that it would reduce its equity stake to 15 % , giving the rest of its stake to bondholders in the restructuring .
KKR also signaled to the company 's creditors that Henry Kravis and other KKR directors of SCI TV would resign from the board once the restructuring is completed and forgo their voting rights .
Holders of SCI TV 's $ 507 million of high-yield junk bonds are being asked to forgive a lot of debt in exchange for taking a 39 % equity stake in SCI TV .
They immediately termed the proposal inadequate and said the restructuring would not solve the company 's problems .
`` I think the current plan is sufficiently flawed in a sufficient number of bondholders ' eyes that substantial revisions will be required to get it done , '' says analyst Craig Davis of R.D. Smith & Co. here .
Investors interpreted the KKR move as a desire by the firm to wash its hands of SCI TV .
But a spokesman for KKR says that with only a 15 % equity stake , it would n't be appropriate for KKR to keep board representation .
KKR already has made about $ 1 billion of gains from earlier transactions with SCI TV , thus it is n't significantly affected by the company 's troubles .
SCI TV , which is controlled by Nashville , Tenn. , entrepreneur George Gillett , owns six TV stations , including several CBS Inc. affiliates .
It is having trouble meeting its debt payments because of heavy borrowing in 1987 for a leveraged buy-out .
Through investment banker Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. , SCI TV is offering to exchange three classes of junk bonds for packages of new bonds and equity that investors value at ranges from 20 cents to 70 cents on the dollar .
KKR would give up a 31 % equity stake to bondholders , while Mr. Gillett would surrender an 8 % stake .
While one big SCI TV investor thinks that 's pretty generous , many junkholders had been hoping that KKR and Mr. Gillett would invest new money in SCI TV .
Those investors think SCI TV needs new equity to survive .
SCI TV 's debt restructuring plan would defer payment of $ 153 million of bank debt .
It also would defer interest and principal on junk bonds
that have fallen due ; the grace period for paying the bill expires Nov. 16 .
At the same time , investors estimate the restructuring would cut the company 's annual cash interest bill from about $ 90 million to $ 85 million .
Yet to pay that interest bill , analysts say SCI TV will only produce about $ 80 million to $ 90 million of cash flow a year .
Hudson 's Bay Co. announced terms of a previously proposed rights issue
that is expected to raise about 396 million Canadian dollars ( US$ 337 million ) net of expenses .
Proceeds of the offering will be used to redeem C$ 264 million of preferred shares and to reduce short-term debt , the company said .
Canada 's largest department store operator said the rights offering will entitle holders of its ordinary shares , except residents in the U.S. and Britain , to subscribe for two additional shares for every five shares held at a price of C$ 31.25
The record date is Nov. 9 .
The company has about 31 million ordinary shares outstanding .
On the Toronto Stock Exchange , Hudson 's Bay shares closed at C$ 35 , up 12.5 cents .
Hudson 's Bay said that Woodbridge Co. , which currently holds about 77 % of the ordinary shares , will subscribe for all the shares to which
it is entitled and for any shares
that are n't otherwise taken up .
Woodbridge is a holding company owned by Toronto 's Thomson family .
Hudson 's Bay said it will redeem 9.5 million Series H preferred shares on Oct. 31 at a price of C$ 27.75 each .
The move was approved at a special shareholders ' meeting yesterday .
Gary Lukassen , chief financial officer , said redemption of the preferred shares , originally issued at C$ 25 each , will eliminate dividend payments of C$ 17.9 million annually .
The Labor Department cited USX Corp. for numerous health and safety violations at two Pennsylvania plants , and proposed $ 7.3 million in fines , the largest penalty ever proposed for alleged workplace violations by an employer .
The department 's Occupational Safety and Health Administration proposed fines of $ 6.1 million for alleged violations at the company 's Fairless Hills , Pa. , steel mill ; that was a record for proposed penalties at any single facility .
OSHA cited nearly 1,500 alleged violations of federal electrical , crane-safety , record-keeping and other requirements .
A second citation covering the company 's Clairton , Pa. , coke works involved more than 200 alleged violations of electrical-safety and other requirements , for which
OSHA proposed $ 1.2 million in fines .
Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole said , `` The magnitude of these penalties and citations is matched only by the magnitude of the hazards to workers
which resulted from corporate indifference to worker safety and health , and severe cutbacks in the maintenance and repair programs needed to remove those hazards .
OSHA said there have been three worker fatalities at the two plants in the past two years and 17 deaths since 1972 .
Gerard Scannell , the head of OSHA , said USX managers have known about many of the safety and health deficiencies at the plants for years , `` yet have failed to take necessary action to counteract the hazards .
`` Particularly flagrant , '' Mrs. Dole said , `` are the company 's numerous failures to properly record injuries at its Fairless works , in spite of the firm promise
it had made in an earlier corporate-wide settlement agreement to correct such discrepancies .
'' That settlement was in April 1987 .
A USX spokesman said the company had n't yet received any documents from OSHA regarding the penalty or fine .
`` Once we do , they will receive very serious evaluation , '' the spokesman said .
`` No consideration is more important than the health and safety of our employees .
USX said it has been cooperating with OSHA since the agency began investigating the Clairton and Fairless works .
He said that , if and when safety problems were identified , they were corrected .
The USX citations represented the first sizable enforcement action taken by OSHA under Mr. Scannell .
He has promised stiffer fines , though the size of penalties sought by OSHA have been rising in recent years even before he took office
`` The big problem is that USX management has proved unwilling to devote the necessary resources and manpower to removing hazards and to safeguarding safety and health in the plants , '' said Linda Anku , OSHA regional administrator in Philadelphia .
USX has 15 working days to contest the citations and proposed penalties , before the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission .
Before the USX case , OSHA 's largest proposed fine for one employer was $ 4.3 million for alleged safety violations at John Morrell & Co. , a meatpacking subsidiary of United Brands Co. , Cincinnati .
The company is contesting the fine .
Ogilvy & Mather , whose
declining profitability prompted its takeover by WPP Group earlier this year , will see its profit margins bounce back to the `` 11.5 % range '' in 1990 , said Graham Phillips , the agency 's new chairman-elect .
The ad agency 's pretax profit margins were slightly under 10 % at the time of the takeover , according to analysts ; London-based WPP 's goal is to increase margins to 12 % .
Mr. Phillips made his comments during an interview detailing his plans for the agency .
British-born , the 24-year Ogilvy veteran was named last week to succeed Kenneth Roman , who is leaving by year 's end to take a top post at American Express , an Ogilvy client .
Surrounded by stacks of paper , two computers and photos of himself boating and flying , Mr. Phillips laid out several changes
he hopes to make at the agency .
First and foremost , Mr. Phillips said he hopes to improve client service .
Ogilvy under the fastidious Mr. Roman gained a reputation as occasionally being high-handed in its treatment of clients , of preaching what strategy
a client should -- indeed , must -- follow .
And some of its top client-service executives , including Mr. Phillips , were promoted to the point
they were saddled with administrative duties , with little time to see clients .
But Mr. Phillips recently freed himself up to spend more time with clients by delegating much of his administrative work to a deputy .
He also plans to get to know clients that Mr. Roman was closer to , such as Lever Brothers , American Express and Seagram .
The two men are planning joint visits to a number of clients to attempt to smoothly hand over the reins .
`` Clients want to see more of our senior people involved in the business -- not once a month , but two or three times
a week , '' he said .
Mr. Phillips also hopes to finally implement a reorganization announced earlier this year but put on hold by the WPP takeover .
The reorganization is supposed to make one-stop shopping -- buying advertising , public relations and design
all in one place , or `` Ogilvy Orchestration '' in Ogilvyspeak -- a reality .
Under the reorganization , Ogilvy plans to name one executive on each account as a `` client service director '' to work as the client 's single contact for all those services .
`` There is little or no integration of our work , quality is spotty , there is no single focus , '' Mr. Phillips complained to staffers in March , when the reorganization was announced .
Now Mr. Phillips says he hopes to have the new system in place for several clients -- including American Express , American Telephone & Telegraph and Ryder -- by year 's end .
Industry executives and analysts are divided on whether Mr. Phillips is up to the task .
He is n't as well-known to clients as is Mr. Roman .
Under his watch , office politicking was often rampant in the agency 's New York operation and the office there has had a dismal new-business record for more than a year .
And while last week
the agency hired a top Chiat\/Day\/Mojo executive , Bill Hamilton , to try to bolster its work , `` Graham has to get the revenue of that New York office moving , '' says James Dougherty , an analyst with County NatWest Securities .
The one thing Mr. Phillips clearly does have going for him is continuity , although it is n't certain if that will be enough .
As Mr. Dougherty says , `` The last thing
they need is enormous disruption at the top ... and Graham is obviously a long-term member of the Ogilvy Mafia , as we call it .
Mr. Phillips and Mr. Roman are indeed quite similar in substance , if not in style .
While Mr. Roman is a workaholic detailsman , Mr. Phillips would rather delegate , leaving him
time for his interests outside the office .
Mr. Roman , by contrast , seems rarely to cut loose at all , although he did appear at Ogilvy 's Halloween party Friday decked out in duck feet and a duck hat , costumed as a `` lame duck .
Mr. Phillips said the company 's expected margin improvement will be all but inevitable , given that the company 's profitability was dragged down this year by an expensive move to luxurious , oversized new New York headquarters .
The move , budgeted at about $ 7 million , actually came in at about $ 10 million , he said .
But margins will be helped , too , by some other cost-saving steps .
Ogilvy eliminated the mail room staff , closed the executive dining room and , after the takeover , let go half a dozen financial executives .
WPP , which assumes financial control of its businesses in a hands-on way , instituted a new financial system and plans to sublet some floors in Ogilvy 's new headquarters building to outsiders .
The fact that the agency will now be part of a U.K. company , under British accounting rules , will also make the profit picture look better .
Y&R 's Klein Steps Down
Arthur Klein , president of Young & Rubicam 's New York office , stepped down `` temporarily '' in the wake of charges by a federal grand jury in New Haven , Conn. , that he , the agency and another top executive bribed Jamaican tourist officials to win its account in 1981 .
In an internal memo , Alex Kroll , the agency 's chairman , said Mr. Klein decided to remove himself to minimize `` negative reaction '' from prospective clients and others and to prepare for his defense .
`` The fact that he is in the process of defending himself against the present charges could conceivably have an adverse impact on Y&R , '' Mr. Kroll wrote .
He said Mr. Klein will return to his post at the end of the trial `` at which
he will be vindicated .
Mr. Klein will work with Mr. Kroll on some of the agency 's joint venture activities and acquisitions while the case is pending .
Peter Georgescu , president of Y&R 's ad operations , will assume Mr. Klein 's day-to-day role .
Wells Rich 's New Partner
Wells , Rich , Greene named Cheryl Heller as an executive vice president and creative partner in its image group , which concentrates on fashion and visually oriented advertising .
Ms. Heller , 38 , had headed up Boston agency Heller\/Breene , a unit of WCRS .
The agency , with about $ 35 million in billings , will be dissolved , with some of its staffers absorbed by WCRS 's Della Femina McNamee unit in Boston , Ms. Heller said .
She said it was too early to say what would happen to its clients , including Reebok and Apple .
At Wells Rich , Ms. Heller will concentrate on accounts
that include Philip Morris 's Benson & Hedges cigarette brand , which relies on print ads , Ms. Heller 's specialty .
As previously reported , the account is troubled , with Philip Morris asking Backer Spielvogel Bates , Ogilvy & Mather , and possibly others to try their hand at developing new creative work .
Wells Rich declined to comment on the status of the account , as did the other agencies .
HomeFed Corp. said its main subsidiary , Home Federal Savings & Loan , converted from a federal savings and loan to a federal savings bank and changed its name to HomeFed Bank .
The federal Office of Thrift Supervision approved the conversion last Friday , HomeFed said .
The change in charter does n't alter the federal insurance of deposits , federal regulatory powers or company operations , a spokesman said .
Ronald B. Koenig , 55 years old , was named a senior managing director of the Gruntal & Co. brokerage subsidiary of this insurance and financial-services firm .
Mr. Koenig will build the corporate-finance and investment-banking business of Gruntal , which has primarily been a retail-based firm .
He was chairman and co-chief executive officer of Ladenburg , Thalmann & Co. until July , when he was named co-chairman of the investment-banking firm along with Howard L. Blum Jr. , who then became the sole chief executive .
Yesterday , Mr. Blum , 41 , said he
was n't aware of plans at Ladenburg to name a co-chairman to succeed Mr. Koenig and said the board would need to approve any appointments or title changes .
Mr. Blum added he
was n't surprised Mr. Koenig resigned , but his departure was `` nothing that we desired or worked for .
'' Mr. Koenig said : `` I just got a tremendous offer from Gruntal .
The Justice Department said it filed a lawsuit seeking more than $ 7.7 million from a Meredith Corp. unit on charges that the company defrauded the government on a contract to provide relocation services for federal employees .
The suit , filed in federal trial court in Des Moines , Iowa , where Meredith is based , alleges that the diversified media company 's relocation unit cheated the government by misrepresenting the value of government employees ' homes .
The government contract required Meredith Relocation Corp. to purchase employees ' homes based on independent appraisals .
The Justice Department alleges that the company `` engaged in various forms of misrepresentation '' with the goal of reducing the appraised value of employees ' homes .
In the suit , the department seeks to recover $ 7.7 million in costs incurred when the government terminated its contract with Meredith Relocation and sought other contracts to replace it .
The department also said it seeks `` three times
the government 's damages , which are presently undetermined , plus penalties .
Officials with Meredith did n't have any immediate comment on the suit .
Sun Microsystems Inc. , snapping back to profitability after its first quarterly loss as a public firm , said it earned $ 5.2 million , or seven cents
a share , in the fiscal first quarter .
Sun , a maker of computer workstations , reported sales of $ 538.5 million for the quarter ended Sept. 29 , up 39 % from $ 388.5 million
In the 1988 period , the company earned $ 20.6 million , or 26 cents
Sun 's results were slightly better than expectations .
Earlier this month , the company said it expected to break even for the quarter on sales of $ 530 million .
In a statement , Scott McNealy , Sun 's chief executive officer , said the company 's performance was hampered by problems tied to the introduction of a major new family of computers in April .
One of those new computers , called Sparcstation 1 , accounted for nearly half of the 28,000 systems Sun shipped in the quarter , he said .
More than two-thirds of the systems shipped , meanwhile , were products introduced in April .
But problems in manufacturing , forecasting demand and getting the bugs out of a new management information system made it extremely difficult for Sun to meet demand for its newest computers well into the summer .
These problems also resulted in Sun reporting a $ 20.3 million loss for its fourth quarter ended June 30 .
Mr. McNealy said the issues
that hurt Sun 's performance earlier this year are now `` largely '' behind the firm , and he indicated that Sun 's profitability should increase throughout the fiscal year .
Sun also reported a record backlog of orders .
While this indicates continued strong demand for the company 's desk-top computers , Sun faces increasing competition from Digital Equipment Corp. and Hewlett-Packard Co .
Recently , analysts have said Sun also is vulnerable to competition from International Business Machines Corp. , which plans to introduce a group of workstations early next year , and Next Inc .
If growth regains its glamour among investors , a sluggish segment of the Nasdaq over-the-counter market could show some flash .
Some stock pickers already are targeting the OTC market , where , they say , await plenty of small - and medium-sized growth stocks .
Best of all , they add , these growth issues , unlike their big blue-chip cousins on the New York Stock Exchange , are languishing at depressed prices .
Growth stocks will return to favor , some analysts and money managers think , because of the jitters caused by the market 's steep slide on Oct. 13 , and because of the current swell of disappointing earnings announcements .
Against such a backdrop , companies with proven track records of earnings gains of 20 % or so annually have extra appeal .
`` The market will have to look for a new theme now and that theme will be a return to growth , '' declares Mary Farrell , a PaineWebber analyst .
Among her OTC picks are Oshkosh B'Gosh and A&W Brands .
Like many OTC growth issues , they have market values -- as measured by stock price times shares outstanding -- of roughly $ 100 million to $ 500 million .
Some like to specialize in growth companies whose shares have n't traded publicly very long .
These are sometimes dubbed `` emerging '' growth companies , though they also have expanding-profit track records .
While many growth stocks are small , not all small stocks have earnings-growth momentum .
That 's an important distinction because some analysts and brokers , who perennially predict that small stocks are about to outperform bigger issues , may use any spurt in growth issues to help them sell all small stocks .
`` You can find some good , quality companies over the counter , '' but investors should be selective , says John Palicka , chief portfolio manager at Midco Investors , a Newark , N.J. , money management company with about $ 900 million invested in growth stocks of varying sizes .
Mr. Palicka 's picks from the OTC market include Legent , Mail Boxes Etc. , and Payco American .
The main argument for growth stocks is their usually superior performance in a slowing economy .
`` If the market refocuses on earnings , we should get better valuations of growth stocks , '' says L. Keith Mullins , a growth-stock analyst at Morgan Stanley .
Eventually , he believes , investors will be willing to pay higher prices for companies with proven track records of earnings growth .
In anticipation of that shift , he and other analysts are encouraging their clients to buy such issues now .
Understandably , smaller growth stocks have n't been in favor recently .
The average issue on Standard & Poor 's 500-stock Index gained 35 % last year , Ms. Farrell of PaineWebber says .
Smaller-stock earnings , by comparison , rose between 15 % and 20 % .
In addition , earnings growth took a back seat to cash flow , restructuring and takeover potential , and breakup value as the preferred stock-picking standards for much of the year .
Also , the smaller growth stocks are n't widely traded , and so are harder to buy and sell quickly than blue chips .
As a result , Morgan Stanley 's Index of 40 Emerging Growth Stocks -- most of which are in the OTC market -- is up only 13 % for the year , while the Dow Jones Industrial Average has leaped 24 % and the S&P 500 has grown 25 % .
The Nasdaq Composite has gained 23 %
this year , but that 's largely due to the 100 largest nonfinancial stocks , which have soared 30 % .
Some investors are skeptical of growth stocks because investing in them means ignoring that maxim found in the fine print of some investment advertisements -- that past performance is n't indicative of future results .
`` People are naturally suspicious of them , '' says Mr. Mullins of Morgan Stanley .
Among his favorites in his firm 's index are Legent , Silicon Graphics and Novell .
However , more money managers are reassured that profit is regaining importance .
Mark Schoeppner , portfolio manager at Pittsburgh-based Quaker Capital Management , says that in reaction to nervousness about debt-laden buy-out transactions , analysts and investors now appear to be `` valuing stock based on future earnings as opposed to the amount of debt
the company can support
. ''
Barney Hallingby , managing director of research at Hambrecht & Quist , also believes earnings growth is beginning to play a greater part in investors ' buying decisions .
On Friday , Hambrecht & Quist added St. Jude Medical to the list of 20 stocks
it strongly recommends .
The opinion is largely based on the company 's earnings momentum , Mr. Hallingby says .
St. Jude 's market value on Nasdaq exceeds $ 1 billion , so it is n't a small stock .
The medical devices maker 's earnings rose nearly 35 % in 1987 from 1986 , and 75 % in 1988 .
Kurt Kruger , who follows the stock for Hambrecht & Quist , anticipates that the company 's net income will grow 51 % to $ 2.15
St. Jude finished up 1\/4 to 44 1\/2 on Friday .

Time Warner Inc. is considering a legal challenge to Tele-Communications Inc. 's plan to buy half of Showtime Networks Inc. , a move
that could lead to all-out war between the cable industry 's two most powerful players .
Time is also fighting the transaction on other fronts , by attempting to discourage other cable operators from joining Tele-Communications as investors in Showtime , cable-TV industry executives say .
Time officials declined to comment .
Last week , Tele-Communications agreed to pay Viacom Inc. $ 225 million for a 50 % stake in its Showtime subsidiary , which is a distant second to Time 's Home Box Office in the delivery of pay-TV networks to cable subscribers .
Tele-Communications , the U.S. 's largest cable company , said it may seek other cable partners to join in its investment .
Tele-Communications is HBO 's largest customer , and the two have a number of other business relationships .
Earlier this year , Time even discussed bringing Tele-Communications in as an investor in HBO , executives at both
companies said .
The purchase of the Showtime stake is `` a direct slap in our face , '' said one senior Time executive .
Time is expected to mount a legal challenge in U.S. District Court in New York , where Viacom in May filed a $ 2.5 billion antitrust suit charging Time and HBO with monopolizing the pay-TV business and trying to crush competition from Showtime .
Executives involved in plotting Time 's defense say it is now preparing a countersuit naming both Viacom and Tele-Communications as defendants .
The executives say Time may seek to break up the transaction after it is consummated , or may seek constraints
that would prevent Tele-Communications from dropping HBO in any of its cable systems in favor of Showtime .
Viacom officials declined to comment .
Jerome Kern , Tele-Communications ' chief outside counsel , said he
was n't aware of Time 's legal plans .
But he said that any effort by Time to characterize the Tele-Communications investment in Showtime as anti-competitive would be `` the pot calling the kettle black .
`` It 's hard to see how an investment by the largest { cable operator } in the weaker of the two networks is anti-competitive , when the stronger of the two networks is owned by the second largest '' cable operator , Mr. Kern said .
In addition to owning HBO , with 22 million subscribers , Time Warner separately operates cable-TV system serving about 5.6 million cable-TV subscribers .
Tele-Communications controls close to 12 million cable subscribers , and Viacom has about one million .
In its suit against Time , Viacom says the ownership of both cable systems and cable-programming networks gives the company
too much market power .
Time argues that in joining up with Tele-Communications , Viacom has potentially more power , particularly since Viacom also owns cable networks MTV , VH-1 and Nick at Nite .
Ironically , Tele-Communications and Time have often worked closely in the cable business .
Together , they control nearly 40 % of Turner Broadcasting Systems Inc. ; Tele-Communications has a 21.8 % stake , while Time Warner has a 17.8 % stake .
But since Time 's merger with Warner Communications Inc. , relations between the two have become strained .
Each company worries that the other is becoming too powerful and too vertically integrated .
Meanwhile , some legal observers say the Tele-Communications investment and other developments are weakening Viacom 's antitrust suit against Time .
Viacom accuses Time in its suit of refusing to carry Showtime or a sister service , The Movie Channel , on Time 's Manhattan Cable TV system , one of the nation 's largest urban systems .
But yesterday , Manhattan Cable announced it will launch Showtime on Nov. 1 to over 230,000 subscribers .
Showtime has also accused HBO of locking up the lion 's share of Hollywood 's movies by signing exclusive contracts with all the major studios .
But Showtime has continued to sign new contracts with Hollywood studios , and yesterday announced it will buy movies from Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. , which currently has a non-exclusive arrangement with HBO .
It has more drug users than Boston has people .
Thirty-four thousand of its children live in foster homes , while 50,000 residents have no homes at all .
Its tax base is shrinking , a $ 1 billion budget deficit looms , and the city faces contract negotiations with all major municipal unions next year .
This is New York City .
When the dust and dirt settle in an extra-nasty mayoral race , the man most likely to gain custody of all this is a career politician named David Dinkins .
Running the nation 's largest and most ornery city may be no treat , but at least Mr. Dinkins knows what to expect from it .
As the campaign hits the home stretch , however , voters still have very little idea
they can expect from him .
After 25 years in city politics , David Dinkins remains an enigma .
The soft-spoken , silver-haired Manhattan borough president -- the first black man to win the Democratic nomination for mayor here -- does n't have a single prominent political enemy .
While he is widely described as a man with deep convictions , he has few major political programs that he can call his own .
Asked about his greatest achievement in public life , he first speaks about the quality of his staff .
Now , as election day nears , even some supporters wonder what
he will do if he wins the mayoralty on Nov. 7 .
They wonder whether he can be firm with his longtime allies , including union leaders and political cronies
who may seek a place at the trough .
They wonder whether he has the economic know-how to steer the city through a possible fiscal crisis , and they wonder who will be advising him .
Will he , if he wins , be in the thrall of the most liberal of his allies , who advocate such policies as rent control for commercial buildings , or will he tilt toward the real-estate interests
that have funneled money into his campaign ?
After his decisive primary victory over Mayor Edward I. Koch in September , Mr. Dinkins coasted , until recently , on a quite-comfortable lead over his Republican opponent , Rudolph Giuliani , the former crime buster
who has proved a something of a bust as a candidate .
But Mr. Dinkins has stumbled in the past two weeks over his campaign 's payments to a black activist
who is a convicted kidnapper , and over his handling of a stock sale to his son .
Polls also have recorded some slippage in Mr. Dinkins 's support among Jewish voters , and citywide projections now put his lead at between four and 20 percentage points .
In an interview with reporters and editors of The Wall Street Journal , Mr. Dinkins appears quite confident of victory and of his ability to handle the mayoralty .
`` A lot of people think I will give away the store , but I can assure you
I will not , '' he says .
`` I am aware we have real budgetary problems .
The city is full of aging bridges , water mains and roadways
that are in need of billions of dollars worth of repair .
Renewed efforts to fight drugs and crime will be costly .
But city officials say tax revenues are lagging .
And after a decade of explosive job growth on Wall Street , a period of contraction is under way .
Mr. Koch already has announced he will drop 3,200 jobs from the city payroll , but that wo n't be enough .
New York State Comptroller Edward Regan predicts a $ 1.3 billion budget gap for the city 's next fiscal year , a gap
that could grow if there is a recession .
If elected , Mr. Dinkins will probably have no choice but to raise taxes on overburdened businesses or cut spending in already under-serviced neighborhoods .
`` He is going to face a mess , '' says City Council President Andrew Stein .
`` His supporters are not venal , but their solution to everything will be to spend more money , and he wo n't have any money .
By and large , Mr. Dinkins has finessed the touchy question of whose ox
he would gore .
Instead of focusing on the financial future , Mr. Dinkins has sold himself as a unifier for a city recently touched by racial violence and as a soothing antidote to 12 years of commotion generated by Mayor Koch .
`` The thing about the Dinkins candidacy is that it offers hope to a broad range of people , '' says Meyer Frucher , a real-estate executive and former aide to Gov. Mario Cuomo .
`` It is a feel-good candidacy .
No doubt , Mr. Dinkins has been a calming influence .
He is an avuncular figure
who remembers the birthdays of colleagues ' children , opens doors for women , and almost never has a bad word to say about anybody .
More important , he emerged as a peacemaker last summer after the Central Park rape of a white jogger -- in which
a group of Harlem teens was charged -- and the racial murder of a black teen-ager in the white Brooklyn neighborhood of Bensonhurst .
Rather than scaring off white voters , as many predicted he would , Mr. Dinkins attracted many whites precisely because of his reputation for having a cool head .
( Keeping cool is a Dinkins priority : On humid days
this summer , he was known to change his double-breasted suits as many as four times
But even in his front-runner campaign , he has shown signs of the indecisiveness and confusion that some say has plagued his tenure as Manhattan borough president -- and might hinder him as mayor .
Over the last few weeks , he has frittered away roughly half of what was once a 33-point lead in the polls over Mr. Giuliani .
A story about how he mishandled the sale to his son of his stock in a media company controlled by his political patron Percy Sutton was allowed to fester a full week before Mr. Dinkins faced the media .
He has canceled numerous campaign appointments and was largely inaccessible to the media until the stock story broke .
His campaign was caught flat-footed amid allegations
it paid almost $ 10,000 for what
it said was a `` get-out-the-vote '' effort by black activist Sonny Carson , a convicted kidnapper
who later said publicly that he is `` anti-white .
'' Critics have said the payment looked like an attempt by the Dinkins camp to get Mr. Carson to stop leading confrontational demonstrations protesting the Bensonhurst murder -- protests the campaign may have feared could cause some white voters to turn from a black candidate .
Mr. Dinkins also has failed to allay Jewish voters ' fears about his association with the Rev. Jesse Jackson , despite the fact that few local non-Jewish politicians have been as vocal for Jewish causes in the past 20 years as Mr. Dinkins has .
These campaign problems have echoed difficulties Mr. Dinkins has run into before .
A former U.S. Marine , Mr. Dinkins got off to a quick start in politics , joining a local Democratic political club in the 1950s , linking up with black urban leaders such as Charles Rangel , Basil Paterson and Mr. Sutton , and getting himself elected to the state assembly in 1965 .
But his chance to become deputy mayor under Mayor Abraham Beame , a plan boosted by Mr. Sutton , was squandered because of Mr. Dinkins 's failure -- still largely unexplained -- to file income tax returns for four years running .
`` I always thought of this as a thing
that could always be done tomorrow , '' he said at the time .
Later , Mr. Dinkins became more deeply indebted to Mr. Sutton and other city pols , including then-City Council President Paul O'Dwyer , when they helped him get appointed city clerk , a largely ceremonial post responsible for the city 's marriage bureau , among other things .
( Mr. O'Dwyer is now one of the lawyers for Mr. Sutton 's media company .
The debt rose further in 1977 when Mr. Sutton resigned his position as Manhattan borough president to run for mayor .
Mr. Sutton recalls : `` When I left , I sat down with Charlie { Rangel } , Basil { Paterson } and David , and David said , ` Who will run for borough president ?
' And I said , ` You will .
David Garth , Mayor Koch 's longtime media adviser , says of Mr. Dinkins , `` He really is the personification of the patronage system .
But the guy is so personally decent , people tend to forget that .
Mr. Dinkins lost twice by wide margins before finally getting elected borough president in 1985 .
But by most accounts , he made little of the post and was best known among city politicians for his problems making up his mind on matters before the city 's Board of Estimate , the body
that votes on crucial budget and land-use matters .
Colleagues today recall with some humor how meetings would crawl into the early morning hours as Mr. Dinkins would march his staff out of board meetings and into his private office to discuss , en masse , certain controversial proposals .
`` He taught me how to drink herbal tea instead of coffee at 3 a.m. , I 'll give him that , '' says Deputy Mayor Robert Esnard .
Often , Mr. Dinkins 's procrastination prevented him from having a say in the way things turned out , critics claim .
On the campaign stump , he often points out that he was the only Board of Estimate member to vote against a controversial real-estate project at Manhattan 's Columbus Circle .
But board members say he took so long to decide how to vote that by the time
he decided , it was too late to try to draw other members to his position .
Says one city official : `` Everybody else had brought in the wagons and made their deal .
He would have got a lot more done if he made up his mind faster .
One Board member , Bronx Borough President Ferdinand Ferrer , was said to be so impatient with Mr. Dinkins 's behavior at many meetings that he withheld his support for Mr. Dinkins 's mayoral effort until late in the primary campaign .
`` I had some problem from time to time on the length of time
he would take to make up his mind , '' Mr. Ferrer admits , but he maintains that he did n't delay his support of Mr. Dinkins and that he backs the Democratic candidate enthusiastically .
Mr. Dinkins 's campaign manager and former chief of staff , Bill Lynch , denies that the Manhattan borough president has taken too long to decide important issues .
`` We did n't rubber-stamp everything
that came to us , '' Mr. Lynch says .
On some occasions when Mr. Dinkins has discussed the issues during the campaign , he has run into a familiar kind of trouble .
Some supporters were stunned this summer when Mr. Dinkins suggested weakening the law forbidding public employees to go on strike .
He withdrew the remark .
When he later sided with striking hospital workers , some allies cringed a little more , concerned that Mr. Dinkins was setting the wrong tone for coming contract negotiations with city employees .
Then , two days before receiving an endorsement from environmental groups , Mr. Dinkins promised he would issue a three-year moratorium on construction of garbage-incinerator plants .
That announcement was roundly criticized by Mayor Koch -- who has endorsed Mr. Dinkins -- because the city faces a garbage crisis and has already spent $ 5 million planning for an incinerator
that would be scrapped under Mr. Dinkins 's proposal .
While his public statements have at times been confusing , Mr. Dinkins 's position papers have more consistently reflected anti-development sentiment .
He favors a form of commercial rent control , which
the financial community believes would make it more difficult to attract investment in the city .
In the midst of a labor shortage , he proposes linking city subsidies to businesses to their record of hiring New York City residents .
With an untrained local labor pool , many experts believe , that policy could drive businesses from the city .
And he favors a more cooperative approach toward the neighboring states of New Jersey and Connecticut in the battle over companies thinking of moving employees out of New York City .
Many economic-development officials say the Koch administration 's aggressive approach helped save 5,000 Chase Manhattan Bank jobs from moving across the Hudson .
But Mr. Dinkins 's economic planks do n't seem to bother the business community , where he draws significant support .
Steven Spinola , president of the Real Estate Board of New York , an industry organization , says Mr. Dinkins 's `` economic development program is shortsighted , but when it comes down to it , he can be reasonable .
Mr. Dinkins 's inner circle of advisers appears to include both
ideologues and pragmatists , leaving voters with little clue as to who will be more influential .
The key man seems to be the campaign manager , Mr. Lynch .
A disheveled , roly-poly son of a Long Island potato farmer , Mr. Lynch is a veteran union organizer
who worked on the presidential campaigns of Sen. Edward Kennedy and Mr. Jackson .
But as the Dinkins campaign hit tough times
this month , Andrew Cuomo , the politically seasoned son of the New York governor , is also said to have taken a more active role on strategy .
Another close ally is Ruth Messinger , a Manhattan city councilwoman , some of whose programs , such as commercial rent control , have made their way into Mr. Dinkins 's position papers .
If she remains influential with Mr. Dinkins , as some suggest she will , his mayoralty may take on a more anti-development flavor .
But Lincoln Center President Nathan Leventhal , who would head a Dinkins transition team , is more mainstream , as is real-estate executive Anthony Gliedman , another insider .
Mr. Dinkins also has said he would receive economic advice from a board
that would include American Express Co. chairman James D. Robinson III , investment banker Felix Rohatyn , leveraged-buy-out specialist Reginald Lewis and attorney Joseph Flom .
Some business leaders and others also believe that Mr. Dinkins would place significant responsibility in the hands of a deputy mayor with a strong administrative background .
Names of possible deputies
that have surfaced include former mayoral candidate Richard Ravitch , former schools chancellor Frank Macchiarola and Messrs. Leventhal and Gliedman .
Then there are Mr. Dinkins 's old-time Harlem colleagues , such as U.S. Rep. Rangel , former Deputy Mayor Paterson and Mr. Sutton .
Having attained positions of real influence or wealth , these men constitute the Old Guard of New York City black politics ; they are less confrontational than the younger , more activist black political community
that has been based largely in Brooklyn .
( Part of Mr. Dinkins 's strength is his ability to win the support of both
the Brooklyn and Harlem factions .
`` We know there are potholes for the city out there , '' says Mr. Paterson , Mr. Dinkins 's former law partner .
`` If any of us think we 're going to sidetrack David 's determination to be the best possible mayor because of his obligations to us , we are making a sad mistake .
'' Adds Ms. Messinger , who is expected to win the borough president 's job Mr. Dinkins is vacating , `` You have to remember David is a pragmatist .
But Mr. Dinkins 's sense of pragmatism often comes across more as an insider 's determination not to upset the political apple cart .
He is taken aback in an interview when asked whether , as mayor , he plans on reforming the political `` fiefdoms '' that perpetuate the monumental ineffectiveness of New York 's school system .
`` I will sit down and talk some of the problems out , but take on the political system ?
Uh-uh , '' he says with a shake of the head .
Despite many doubts about his candidacy , white New Yorkers -- who gave Mr. Dinkins 30 % of their votes in the primary -- are n't expected to desert in sufficient numbers to turn the election to Mr. Giuliani .
The former U.S. attorney , who prosecuted targets ranging from Mafia dons to Wall Street executives , has succeeded in raising questions about Mr. Dinkins 's ethical standards , but so far has failed to generate excitement about his own candidacy .
As a Republican in an overwhelmingly Democratic city , Mr. Giuliani has an inherent handicap .
As a first-time candidate , he has been slow to learn the nuances of New York City politicking .
Mr. Giuliani is finding that Mr. Dinkins , in his many years in public life , has built up considerable good will that so far has led many voters to overlook certain failings .
`` The bottom line is that he is a very genuine and decent guy , '' says Malcolm Hoenlein , a Jewish community leader .
`` In the end , I think David will be judged for being David .
The government issues its first reading on third-quarter real gross national product
this week in a report
that is expected to disclose much tamer inflation .
The consensus view on real GNP , the total value of the nation 's output of goods and services adjusted for inflation , calls for a 2.3 % gain , down from the second quarter 's 2.5 % , according to MMS International , a unit of McGraw-Hill Inc. , New York .
But inflation , as measured by the GNP deflator in Thursday 's report , is expected to rise only 3.5 % , down from 4.6 % in the second quarter .
`` Inflation could be a real surprise , '' said Samuel D. Kahan , chief financial economist at Kleinwort Benson Government Securities Inc. , in Chicago .
`` If that gets people excited , it could serve as an impetus to the fixed-income markets to lower their rates , '' he added .
The week 's other notable indicators include mid-October auto sales , September durable goods orders as well as September personal income , personal consumption and the saving rate .
Most are expected to fall below previous-month levels .
Many economists see even slower GNP growth for the remainder of the year , with some leaning more strongly toward a possible recession .
In addition to softer production data , weaker housing starts and lower corporate profits currently in evidence , some analysts believe the two recent natural disasters -- Hurricane Hugo and the San Francisco earthquake -- will carry economic ramifications in the fourth quarter .
The recent one-day , 190-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average seems to be significant to economists mainly for its tacit comment on the poor quality of third-quarter profits now being reported .
`` The stock market is sick because profits are crumbling , '' says Michael K. Evans , president of Evans Economics Inc. , Washington .
The economy , he noted , moves the market , not vice versa .
On the other hand , Mr. Evans expects the hurricane and the earthquake `` to take a hunk out of fourth-quarter GNP .
'' His estimate of 3.3 % for third-quarter GNP is higher than the consensus largely because he believes current inventories are n't as low as official figures indicate .
Demand , he believes , is being met from overhang rather than new production .
By and large , economists believe the two natural catastrophes will limit economic damage to their regions .
Edward J. Campbell , economist at Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. , New York , noted that large increases in construction activity along with government and private relief efforts could offset loss of production in those areas .
Gary Ciminero , economist at Fleet\/Norstar Financial Group , Providence , R.I. , expects the deflator to rise 3.7 % , well below the second quarter 's 4.6 % , partly because of what
he believes will be temporarily better price behavior .
He expects real GNP growth of only 2.1 % for the quarter , noting a wider trade deficit , slower capital and government spending and the lower inventory figures .
Sung Won Sohn , chief economist at Norwest Corp. , Minneapolis , holds that the recent stock-market volatility `` increases the possibility of economic recession and reinforces the bad news '' from recent trade deficit , employment and housing reports .
The consensus calls for a 0.5 % increase in September personal income and a 0.3 % gain in consumption .
In August , personal income rose 0.4 % and personal consumption increased 0.9 % .
Charles Lieberman , managing director of financial markets reasearch at Manufacturers Hanover Securities Corp. , New York , said Hurrican Hugo shaved 0.1 % to 0.2 % from personal-income growth , because of greatly diminished rental income from tourism .
Durable goods orders for September , due out tomorrow , are expected to show a slip of 1 % , compared with August 's 3.9 % increase .
As usual , estimates on the fickle report are wide , running from a drop of 3.5 % to a gain of 1.6 % .
John Lehman 's editorial-page article on the Pentagon as a haunted house omits the real roots of its ghost population ( `` In
the Pentagon , the Undead Walk , '' Oct. 18 ) .
The media 's treatment of the Defense Department during the Vietnam War , the Carter administration 's denigration of the military , and the public scapegoating of Lt. Col. Oliver North have all served to emasculate the poor souls
who live there .
The resulting haunted house tends to reward followership , not leadership , it creates guilt about wearing the uniform , and raises doubt about having the will to fulfill the ghosts ' role , i.e. , to be able to win if called on .
Perhaps the Halloween season is a good time for Congress to be looking at funding for some
ghostbusting equipment .

Former Air Force Career Officer

Where does Mr. Lehman get off castigating Gen. George Marshall for muscling in on naval prerogatives ?
Ever since the days of Alfred Thayer Mahan ( U.S. naval officer and naval historian ) and Teddy Roosevelt
the Navy has been the service most favored by Washington officialdom .
Mr. Lehman overlooks the fact that the Navy possesses its own air force ( the carrier fleet ) and its own army ( the Marines ) , which in turn has its own air force .
Of course these turf battles are unseemly , wasteful and potentially dangerous and should be resolved in the interest of national security , but Mr. Lehman seems to be part of the problem rather than part of the answer .
L.H. Blum
Beaumont , Texas
I agree with Mr. Lehman 100 % !
Is n't this the same guy
who resigned as Navy secretary because he could n't get his 1,000-ship Navy ?
I personally do not want to hasten Mr. Lehman 's demise , but I can see him figuring prominently in his own article .

Part of a Series }
SMYRNA , Ga. -- The auto-dealer strip in this booming suburb runs nearly five miles along Cobb Parkway , stretching from the Perimeter highway
that circles Atlanta to the `` Big Chicken , '' a pullet-roofed fast-food restaurant and local landmark .
Twenty years ago , in the infancy of suburban sprawl , just a handful of dealerships were here .
Now there are 23 .
Alongside such long-familiar names as Chevrolet , Ford and Dodge are nameplates
that did n't exist until three years ago : Acura , Sterling , Hyundai .
Under construction is the strip 's 24th showroom , the future home of Lexus , a luxury marque launched by Toyota Motor Corp. just two months ago .
The 1980s have spawned an explosion of consumer choice in America , in everything from phone companies to colas .
And especially , as the Cobb Parkway strip attests , in cars .
Americans now can choose among 572 different models of cars , vans and trucks , up from just 408 when the decade began , according to Automotive News , a trade publication .
For car marketers , it has become a much tougher battle to keep loyal customers from defecting to one of the new makes on the block .
For American car buyers , the proliferation of choice is both liberating and confusing .
Malcolm MacDougall , vice chairman of the Jordan , McGrath , Case & Taylor advertising agency in New York , calls the proliferation `` nameplate mania .
'' He says the number of automobile choices is causing stress among consumers today , and that people will simply ignore new models
that lack a well-defined image .
`` The winners , '' he predicts , `` will be brands from car makers
that have traditionally been associated with quality and value .
He says it 's important for a new make to be as distinctive as possible while still retaining links to the parent company 's quality image .
He applauds Toyota and Nissan Motor Co. for creating separate divisions for their new luxury models , rather than simply adding more nameplates to their standard car lines .
Some auto executives believe the benefits of more choice outweigh the drawbacks .
's more noise out there , and the consumer may have to work harder to cut through it , '' says Vincent P. Barabba , executive director of market research and planning at General Motors Corp .
`` But the reward is that there
's less need to make tradeoffs '' in choosing one
's wheels .
Jeanene Page , of North Salt Lake City , Utah , likes the broader selection .
She wants something big , and already has looked at the Chrysler New Yorker and Lincoln Town Car .
Now , the 55-year-old car shopper is zeroing in on a full-sized van , figuring that it 's just the thing to haul nine grandchildren and pull a boat at the same time .
`` That seems to be what all my friends are using to take the grandkids to the lake , '' she says .
Market segmentation in cars is n't new , but it 's far more extensive than when Alfred P. Sloan Jr. conceived the idea 50 years ago .
The legendary GM chairman declared that his company would make `` a car for every purse and purpose .
Now there are many cars for every purse and purpose .
Just four years ago , GM planners divided the combined car and truck market into seven segments .
Today , they identify 19 distinct segments for cars , and another 11 for trucks and vans .
The number of makes has mushroomed because the U.S. is the world 's biggest and richest market for automobiles ; virtually every auto maker wants to sell here .
For every brand like Renault or Fiat
that has been squeezed out , others such as Isuzu , Daihatsu and Mitsubishi have come in .
Detroit tries to counter the foreign invasion with new brands of its own .
GM launched the Geo marque
this year to sell cars made in partnership with foreign auto makers , and next year GM 's long-awaited Saturn cars will make their debut .
Ford Motor Co. created the Merkur nameplate in 1985 to sell its German-made touring sedans in the U.S .
But slow sales forced Ford to kill the brand just last week .
When consumers have so many choices , brand loyalty is much harder to maintain .
The Wall Street Journal 's `` American Way of Buying '' survey found that 53 % of today 's car buyers tend to switch brands .
For the survey , Peter D. Hart Research Associates and the Roper Organization
each asked about 2,000 U.S. consumers about their buying habits .
Which cars do Americans favor most these days ?
It 's hard to generalize , but age seems to be the best predictor .
Adults under age 30 like sports cars , luxury cars , convertibles and imports far more than their elders do .
Three of every 10 buyers under 30 would prefer to buy a sports car , compared with just 16 % of adults 30 and over , according to the Journal survey .
Young consumers prefer luxury cars by a 37 % to 28 % margin -- even though older buyers , because of their incomes , are more likely to actually purchase a luxury car .
Perhaps most striking , 35 % of households headed by people aged 18 to 44 have at least one foreign car .
That 's true of only 14 % of households headed by someone
60 or older .
Generally , imports appeal most to Americans
who live in the West and are well-educated , affluent and , especially , young .
`` For many baby boomers , buying a domestic car is a totally foreign experience , '' says Christopher Cedergren , auto-market analyst with J.D. Power & Co. of Agoura Hills , Calif .
Such preferences persist even though many Americans believe differences between imported and domestic cars are diminishing .
Only 58 % of Americans now believe that foreign cars get better gas mileage than domestic models , the Journal survey found , down from 68 % in 1987 .
Some 46 % give foreign cars higher quality ratings , down from 50 % two years ago .
On the other hand , only 42 % say foreign cars are less comfortable than U.S. models , down from 55 % in 1987 .
People in the automotive business disagree over how susceptible younger Americans are to brand switching .
`` Once buying habits are formed , they 're very hard to break , '' declares Thomas Mignanelli , executive vice president for Nissan 's U.S. sales operations .
But out on Cobb Parkway , Ted Negas sees it differently .
`` The competition is so intense that an owner 's loyalty to a dealership or a car is virtually nonexistent , '' says Mr. Negas , vice president of Ed Voyles Oldsmobile , one of the first dealerships to locate on the strip .
Thus the very fickleness of baby boomers may make it possible to win them back , just as it was possible to lose them .
The battle for customer loyalty is evident along the Cobb Parkway strip .
Ed Voyles Olds recently established a special section in the service department for owners whose cars are less than a year old , so they get quicker service .
Just down the street , Chris Volvo invites serious shoppers to test-drive a new Volvo to any other dealership along the strip , and compare the cars side-by-side .
Manufacturers , too , are stretching further to lure buyers .
GM 's Cadillac division , ignoring Detroit 's long-held maxim
that safety does n't sell , is airing television commercials touting its cars ' safety features .
Cadillac may be on to something .
Some 60 % of the survey respondents said they would buy anti-lock brakes even if they carry a medium or high price tag .
More than 50 % felt the same way about air bags .
features appealed most to buyers under 45 .
In contrast , dashboard computers , power seats and turbo-charged engines had little appeal .
But even a little appeal has a lot of attraction these days .
GM 's Pontiac division is offering a turbo-charged V-6 engine on its Grand Prix model , even though it expects to sell only about 4,000 cars equipped with that option .
The reason : Items with narrow appeal can be important in a market as fragmented as today 's .
Americans spent more than $ 190 billion on new cars and trucks last year , and just 1 % of that market exceeded Polaroid Co. 's sales of $ 1.86 billion .
`` Even if it 's only 1 % , '' says GM 's Mr. Barabba , `` would you throw away sales
the size of Polaroid ?

Your Sept. 26 `` Politics & Policy '' article about William Bennett 's Emergency Drug Plan for Washington gives the impression that the FBI has not been nor is actively involved .
This is not the case .
The FBI is very supportive of and an active participant in Mr. Bennett 's initiative .
It was agreed at the outset of the Washington Drug Initiative that the FBI 's role would be to continue targeting the major drug traffickers through our National Drug Strategy .
Through these investigations we do not focus on the street drug user , but rather we target and attack major drug-trafficking organizations
that control a large segment of the drug market .
The trial of Raful Edmond III in Washington serves to highlight our efforts in this area and the results achieved through our excellent working relationship with the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Metropolitan Police Department ( MPD ) .
The FBI 's role is to complement the D.C. initiative through not only these major trafficking investigations , but also by providing a full range of services through various task forces and our contacts with local police squads handling drug-related crimes .
In fact , we have agents assigned full time to assist the MPD in drug-related crimes such as homicide and other crimes of violence .

President Bush said that three members of his cabinet will lead a presidential mission to Poland to gauge how the U.S. can help the new non-Communist government 's economic changes .
Mr. Bush announced several weeks ago that he intended to send such a mission , composed of top government aides and business and labor leaders .
The mission will visit Poland from Nov. 29 to Dec. 2 , the White House said .
In remarks at a White House ceremony marking Polish Heritage Month , Mr. Bush announced that Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter , Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher and Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole will lead the U.S. group .
Michael Boskin , chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers , also will be a member .
In addition , the White House said that Charles Harper , chairman of ConAgra Inc. , and John McGillicuddy , chairman of Manufacturers Hanover Corp. , will be among a group of at least 15 business and labor representatives in the presidential mission .
Mr. Bush said the group is to `` focus on economic sectors where U.S. expertise and cooperation can indeed make a difference .
Mr. Bush has asked Congress to provide more than $ 400 million in economic aid and food grants for Poland 's new government , but has been chided by Democrats for failing to do more .
Tandy Corp. , citing sluggish sales of consumer-electronics goods , said net income dropped 3.3 % for the first quarter ended Sept. 30 .
The results , which represented the fifth consecutive quarter of flat-to-lower earnings for the big electronics retailer , disappointed analysts and traders .
Tandy 's stock fell $ 1.375
a share to close at $ 44 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading .
Net for the quarter was $ 62.8 million , or 73 cents
a share , down from $ 64.9 million , or 72 cents
The company said earnings would have increased if it had n't been actively repurchasing its shares , thus increasing its interest expense and reducing its interest income .
Tandy had 86.3 million shares outstanding at Sept. 30 , down from 90 million
Revenue rose 5 % to $ 986 million from $ 937 million .
Tandy said consumer electronics sales at its Radio Shack stores have been slow , partly because of a lack of hot , new products .
`` Radio Shack continues to be lackluster , '' said Dennis Telzrow , analyst with Eppler , Guerin & Turner in Dallas .
He said Tandy `` has done a decent job '' increasing sales by manufacturing computers for others and expanding sales of its Grid Systems Corp. subsidiary , which sells computers to bigger businesses , but `` it 's not enough to offset the problems at Radio Shack .
'' Sales at Radio Shack stores open more than a year grew only 2 % in the quarter from a year earlier , he said .
As a result , Mr. Telzrow said he cut his fiscal 1990 per-share earnings estimate for Tandy to $ 4.05 from $ 4.20 .
Tandy earned $ 88.8 million , or $ 3.64
a share , in the year ended June 30 .
Barry Bryant , an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. , said Tandy also has suffered from lethargic sales of its computers aimed at the home and small-office market , which are less-advanced and cheaper than computers aimed at the corporate market .
Tandy has added several new products to that line , including a laptop computer priced around $ 1,000 , and is focusing its advertising on the easy-to-use software
that is packaged with its machines .
Mr. Bryant and other analysts hope all those moves will combine to help Tandy 's results improve in the important Christmas quarter .
`` They 've been promising 13 % to 15 % growth based on the strategic moves they 've made , '' he said .
`` If the earnings acceleration is to take place , that should be the quarter .
Western European leaders
who favor speedy economic and monetary union are adding a new argument to their arsenal : the dizzying political changes under way in Eastern Europe .
French President Francois Mitterrand , European Community Commission President Jacques Delors , Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez and others have begun linking the rapid changes in the East to the need to speed up changes in the West .
They are stressing that the best way for the West to help the East is to move faster towards Western European economic and monetary unity .
This would make the market-oriented system more attractive to Eastern countries , they argue , and allow greater economic aid and technological know-how to flow from West to East .
`` The only response to the challenge being presented to us by the East , '' Mr. Mitterrand told the European Parliament in Strasbourg yesterday , `` is to reinforce and accelerate the union and cohesion of the European Community .
'' Mr. Mitterrand proposed that a conference be convened next fall to write a new treaty for the EC allowing a European central bank , and that the treaty be ratified by 1992 .
Mr. Mitterrand also proposed a separate `` Bank for Europe '' that would channel development money to the East .
One basis for linking change in the East and change in the West is the notion that integrating 110 million Eastern Europeans with 320 million Western Europeans is primarily the task of Europeans , despite the U.S. 's obvious strategic and economic interest .
Says a European strategist : `` The U.S. tends to look at Eastern Europe { not including the Soviet Union } as Europe looks at Latin America : important but far away .
But for us in Western Europe , these are Europeans next door .
A reintegrated Europe implies big changes in 40-year-old military and economic policies .
There is likely to be a natural division of labor , says Francois Heisbourg , director of the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London , with the U.S. more engaged in strategic issues with the Soviet Union , and Western Europe more involved with specific aid measures for the East .
The designation at July 's economic summit of major industrialized nations of the EC Commission as coordinator of Western aid to Poland and Hungary was a first step .
In part , this division is dictated by economics : West Germany is a net exporter of capital while the U.S. is n't .
While American aid efforts have been limited by budget problems , yesterday France announced a three-year , four billion French franc ( $ 650 million ) aid plan for Poland .
Despite sudden changes in the strategic equation , some Western European leaders , especially British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher , remain skeptical about European political and economic unity , and are unlikely to let East-West concerns change their minds .
But British analysts are beginning to link the issues .
`` We need a Western Ostpolitik , '' says John Roper , of the Royal Institute of International Affairs in London , referring to West Germany 's longstanding policy of a diplomatic opening to the East .
`` For Poland and Hungary we need to think about a stick-and-carrot economic approach
that would force them to price things realistically in return for removing all our tariff barriers .
'' He notes that the Marshall Plan of U.S. aid to Europe `` did n't just throw money at post-war Europe , it also liberalized and opened up those markets .
The French analysis goes further .
`` Most of the West 's leaders have finally concluded that we
all want perestroika { Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev 's policy of economic restructuring } to succeed , '' says Hubert Vedrine , security adviser to Mr. Mitterrand .
`` But they have n't yet drawn the operational policy conclusions .
He adds that with communism collapsing and Mr. Gorbachev scrambling to rejuvenate the Soviet economy , `` Our interest lies in a controlled transformation , a contained nuclear reaction , so we need to help him , and not just with words .
'' Managing change , he adds , will require a lot more aid and a prominent role for the EC , especially in dealing with the question of German reunification .
Thierry de Montbrial , director of the French Institutue for International Relations in Paris , says it is n't clear what , exactly , West Germany wants .
Any push for a Gorbachev vision of a `` common European home , '' implying the eventual dissolution of the EC , a Soviet-German partnership and the withdrawal of U.S. forces , `` would be a very , very serious problem , '' he says .
He doubts a Bismarckian super state will emerge that would dominate Europe , but warns of `` a risk of profound change in the heart of the European Community from a Germany
that is too strong , even if democratic .
He adds : `` We , and the rest of the EC have to talk to the Germans , now , frankly and raise these future risks with them .
While many commentators , particularly French ones , worry that hasty and emotional reaction to the changes in the East might lead to dangerous pressures for a denuclearized Europe or the speeded-up withdrawal of American troops , Mr. Roper in London sees a more positive scenario .
`` There seems to be a message from Moscow there 's a deal on offer , '' he says .
`` They want reassurance
we wo n't try to undermine or destroy the Warsaw Pact ... .
In return , the U.K. and France could keep their nuclear weapons .
He adds : `` Once both
sides feel comfortable , it should be that much easier to make more progress toward the economic and social reforms
that are now starting in the East .
Tandy Corp. said it wo n't join U.S. Memories , the group
that seeks to battle the Japanese in the market for computer memory chips .
Tandy 's decision is a second setback for U.S. Memories .
Last month , Apple Computer Inc. said that it would n't invest in the group .
Apple said that its money would be better spent in areas such as research and development .
U.S. Memories is seeking major investors to back its attempt to crack the $ 10 billion market for dynamic random access memory chips , a market dominated by the Japanese .
Those chips were in dire shortage last year , hurting many U.S. computer companies
that could n't get sufficient Japanese-supplied chips .
Tandy said its experience during the shortage did n't merit
the $ 5 million to $ 50 million investment U.S. Memories is seeking from each investor .
`` At this time , we elected not to get involved because we have been able to satisfy our need { for DRAMs } from the market as a rule , '' said Ed Juge , Tandy 's director of market planning .
Sanford Kane , U.S. Memories president , said the decision was `` disappointing , '' but does n't presage U.S. Memories ' failure .
`` I would like to have had them , '' he said .
But `` they were n't on my list of companies
who were critical to be a part of it .
Mr. Kane became president and chief executive officer of U.S. Memories last June , when the group was formed by seven electronics companies : Advanced Micro Devices Inc. , Digital Equipment Corp. ; Hewlett-Packard Co. ; Intel Corp. ; International Business Machines Corp. ; LSI Logic Corp. and National Semiconductor Corp .
Mr. Kane said he expects two or three major corporations to announce their participation in U.S. Memories soon after the group finishes a business plan , probably late this week .
U.S. Memories needs a catalyst , he said , to inspire others to join .
But so far , most potential participants have n't decided .
Sun Microsystems Inc. said it 's still actively evaluating U.S. Memories and plans to meet with U.S. Memories representatives later this week .
American Telephone & Telegraph Co. said it was waiting to see U.S. Memories ' business plan .
Personal-computer maker AST Research Inc. said it is still studying the situation .
A Compaq Computer Corp. spokeswoman said that the company has n't made a decision yet , although `` it is n't under active consideration .
Benjamin Franklin Federal Savings & Loan Association said it plans to restructure in the wake of a third-quarter loss of $ 7.7 million , or $ 1.01
a share , reflecting an $ 11 million addition to loan-loss reserves .
The Portland , Ore. , thrift said the restructuring should help it meet new capital standards from the Financial Institution Reform , Recovery and Enforcement Act .
A year ago , Benjamin Franklin had profit of $ 1.8 million , or 23 cents
In over-the-counter trading yesterday , Benjamin Franklin rose 25 cents to $ 4.25 .
The company said the restructuring
's initial phase will feature a gradual reduction in assets and staff positions .
The plan may include selling branches , consolidating or eliminating departments , and winding down or disposing of unprofitable units within 18 months .
Initially , the company said it will close its commercial real-estate lending division , and stop originating new leases at its commercial lease subsidiary .
Details of the restructuring wo n't be made final until regulators approve the regulations mandated by the new federal act , the company said .
Robert Q. Marston , president emeritus , University of Florida , and a director of this maker of medical devices , was named chairman .
Dr. Marston , 66 years old , succeeds Alexander T. Daignault , 72 , who did n't stand for re-election due to mandatory board retirement policy .
Some lousy earnings reports whacked the stock market , but bond prices fell only slightly and the dollar rose a little against most major currencies .
The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled 39.55 points , to 2613.73 , in active trading .
Long-term Treasury bonds ended slightly higher .
The dollar rose modestly against the mark and the yen , but soared against the pound following the resignation of Britain 's chancellor of the Exchequer , Nigel Lawson .
Analysts have complained that third-quarter corporate earnings have n't been very good , but the effect hit home particularly hard yesterday .
Compaq Computer nose-dived $ 8.625
a share , to $ 100 , and pulled other technology issues lower after reporting lower-than-expected earnings after the stock market closed Wednesday .
Later yesterday the nation 's major auto makers added to the gloom when they
each reported their core auto operations were net losers in the third quarter .
The less-than-robust third-quarter results came amid renewed concern about the volatility of stock prices and the role of computer-aided program trading .
Taken together , the worries prompted a broad sell-off of stocks .
The number of stocks on the New York Stock Exchange
that fell in price yesterday exceeded 1,000 , a key measure of underlying sentiment among technical analysts .
Although the government said the economy grew an estimated 2.5 % in the third quarter , in line with expectations , analysts are increasingly predicting much more sluggish growth -- and therefore more corporate earnings disappointments -- for the fourth quarter .
`` There are a lot
more downward revisions of earnings forecasts than upward revisions , '' said Abby Joseph Cohen , a market strategist at Drexel Burnham Lambert .
`` People are questioning corporate profits as a pillar of support for the equity market .
The bond market was unmoved by the economic statistics .
While bond investors would have preferred growth to be a little slower , they were cheered by inflation measures in the data
that showed prices rising at a modest annual rate of 2.9 % .
That is another small encouragement for the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates in coming weeks , they reasoned .
In major market activity :
Stock prices fell sharply in active trading .
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled 175.2 million shares .
Declining issues on the Big Board outstripped gainers 1,141 to 406 .
Bond prices were barely higher .
The Treasury 's benchmark 30-year rose fractionally .
Yield on the issue was 7.88 % .
The dollar rose modestly against most major currencies .
In late New York trading the dollar was at 1.8400 marks and 142.10 yen compared with 1.8353 marks and 141.52 yen Wednesday .
The dollar soared against the pound , which was at $ 1.5765 compared with $ 1.6145 Wednesday .
Birmingham Steel Corp. said that its Emeryville , Calif. , minimill sustained only minor damage from last week 's earthquake .
Steelmaking resumed Oct. 18 , but the company expects production to be hampered in the next few months by traffic disruptions around the plant and outages for repair to gas and electric power systems .
Sheraton Corp. and Pan American World Airways announced that they and two Soviet partners will construct two `` world-class '' hotels within a mile of Red Square in Moscow .
U.S. and Soviet officials hailed the joint project as a new indication of the further thaw in U.S.-Soviet relations .
`` This is an outstanding example of how the East and the West can work together for their mutual benefit and progress , '' said Soviet Ambassador Yuri Dubinin , who hosted a signing ceremony for the venture 's partners at the Soviet embassy here .
Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher , who attended the ceremony , called the undertaking
a `` historic step '' in the evolution of U.S.-Soviet ties .
He added that it likely will have a `` mulitiplier effect '' in stimulating further trade between the two countries .
The project will be the largest U.S.-backed joint venture to be undertaken in the Soviet Union in recent years .
One of the hotels , to be called the Sheraton Moscow , will have 450 rooms and will cost an estimated $ 75 million to build .
The six-story hotel will be on Gorky Street and initially will cater mostly to business travelers .
It will have a Russian tavern , an English pub , a discotheque and Japanese and Italian restaurants , according to a Sheraton announcement .
The hotel is scheduled to open in 1992 .
The second hotel , to be called the Budapest Hotel , is to be constructed at a site even closer to Red Square .
Details about its size and cost have n't yet been determined .
Sheraton , a subsidiary of ITT Corp. , will have a 40 % share in the two hotels ; Pan American , a subsidiary of Pan
Am
Corp. , will have a 10 % share .
The Soviet owners will be Mossoviet , Moscow 's city governing body , and Aeroflot , the Soviet national airline .
Although a Finnish group has a minority interest in an already operating Moscow hotel , the Sheraton-Pan
venture will be the first joint-venture hotels in the Soviet Union to have as much as 50 % foreign ownership .
U.S. companies account for less than 8 % of the 1,000 or more Soviet joint ventures
that have been announced since the Soviets began encouraging such undertakings in 1987 .
But some U.S. companies are negotiating projects
that could be among the biggest ones to be launched .
Chevron Corp. , Amoco Corp. , Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. , and Eastman Kodak Co. are among the U.S. companies known to be considering such ventures .
Sheraton and Pan
Am said they are assured under the Soviet joint-venture law that they can repatriate profits from their hotel venture .
The Sheraton Moscow will charge about $ 140 to $ 150
a day for each of its rooms , and it will accept payment only in currencies
that can be traded in foreign exchange markets , according to a Sheraton executive .
Thomas Plaskett , Pan
's chairman , said the U.S. airline 's participation is a natural outgrowth of its current arrangements with Aeroflot to jointly operate nonstop New York-Moscow flights .
He said the rising volume of passenger traffic on this route justifies a major investment in new high-standard Moscow hotels .
Lynch Corp. said its Lynch Telephone Corp. subsidiary completed the acquisition of Western New Mexico Telephone Co. for $ 20 million plus assumption of $ 24 million of debt .
Western New Mexico Telephone , Silver City , had net income of $ 1.9 million on revenue of about $ 10 million last year .
It is an independent phone company with a service area of 15,000 square miles in southwest New Mexico .
It is also a partner in the wireline cellular franchise covering most of western New Mexico .
The transaction represents Lynch 's entry into the telephone business .
The company , which has interests in television , trucking services , and glass-making and food-processing equipment , said it plans to make other acquisitions in the telephone industry .

NRM Energy Co. said it filed materials with the Securities and Exchange Commission calling for it to restructure into a corporation from a limited partnership .
The partnership said it is proposing the change largely because the provisions of its senior notes restrict it from making distributions on its units outstanding .
NRM suspended its common distribution in June 1988 and the distribution on its $ 2 cumulative convertible acquisition preferred units in September .
However , unpaid distributions on the acquisition preferred are cumulative and would total $ 23 million
a year , hurting NRM 's financial flexibility and its ability to raise capital , NRM said .
In following several other oil and gas partnerships
that have made the conversion to a corporation in the last year , NRM also noted that tax advantages for partnerships have diminished under new tax laws and said it would save $ 2 million
a year in administrative costs from the change .
Under the plan , NRM said holders of its common units will receive one share of new common stock in Edisto Resources Corp. for every 14.97 common units owned .
Holders of NRM 's $ 2 cumulative convertible acquisition preferred units will receive one new common share in Edisto for every 1.342 units they own .
After the transaction , current common unitholders will own about 21.3 % of Edisto , current acquisition preferred holders will own 72.3 % , and current stockholders of Edisto will own about 6.4 % , about the same stake as Edisto owns now in NRM .
Edisto currently is the general partner of NRM .
As the largest holder of acquisition preferred units , Mesa Limited Partnership would own about 28 % of Edisto after the transaction .
As part of the transaction , Edisto agreed to give Mesa , an Amarillo , Texas , oil and gas partnership managed by T. Boone Pickens Jr. , a seat on its board .
NRM said its $ 2.60 senior cumulative convertible preferred units will be converted into an equal number of shares of $ 2.60 senior cumulative convertible preferred stock of Edisto .
The transaction is subject to approval of NRM unitholders of record on Oct. 23 , among other conditions .
NRM said it expects unitholders to vote on the restructuring at a meeting Dec. 15 .
Canadian steel ingot production totaled 276,334 metric tons in the week ended Oct. 14 , down 5.3 % from the preceding week 's total of 291,890 tons , Statistics Canada , a federal agency , said .
The week 's total was down 7.1 % from 297,446 tons
A metric ton is equal to 2,204.62 pounds .
The cumulative total in 1989 was 12,283,217 tons , up 7.5 % from 11,429,243 tons
a year earlier .
The Justice Department scrambled to play down the significance of its new guidelines concerning prosecutions under the federal racketeering law .
The guidelines were distributed to U.S. attorneys last summer but were disclosed for the first time by press reports
this week .
They discourage prosecutors , under certain circumstances , from seeking court orders seizing the assets of racketeering defendants prior to trial .
But David Runkel , chief Justice Department spokesman , said the guidelines `` are a codification and a clarification far more than a new direction .
Use of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law against white-collar defendants , as opposed to alleged organized-crime figures , has come under attack from some defense lawyers and legal scholars .
Critics have complained that the law unfairly strips defendants of assets before a jury determines they have committed a crime and that aggressive use of the forfeiture provisions can ruin corporate defendants or force them into unfavorable plea bargains .
In the new guidelines , the Justice Department says that in attempting to freeze disputed assets before trial , `` the government will not seek to disrupt the normal , legitimate business activities of the defendant '' and `` will not seek ... to take from third parties assets legitimately transferred to them .
The guidelines also state , `` The government 's policy is not to seek the fullest forfeiture permissible under the law where that forfeiture would be disproportionate to the defendant 's crime .
Another provision clarifies certain limits on when prosecutors may use tax-fraud charges as a basis for bringing a racketeering case .
Mr. Runkel declined to speculate on whether the guidelines would curb racketeering prosecutions against corporate defendants .
`` The impact , if there is any , will be impossible to judge ahead of time because the decision whether to use { racketeering charges } is made in individual cases '' by Justice Department officials in Washington , he said .
In a memorandum describing the guidelines , Assistant Attorney General Edward Dennis Jr. said that government efforts to freeze defendants ' assets pending racketeering prosecutions `` have been the subject of considerable criticism in the press .
'' But Mr. Runkel said the government is n't `` backing off on these kinds of matters at all .
Japan 's wholesale prices in the first 10 days of October fell 0.3 % from the previous 10 days but rose 3.3 % from a year ago , the Bank of Japan said .
The wholesale price index stood at 89.6 ( 1985 equals 100 ) .
Gillette Co. elected Warren E. Buffett , chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. , to its board , increasing the number of directors to 12 from 11 .
Berkshire Hathaway earlier this year bought $ 600 million of preferred stock in Gillette
that is convertible into an 11 % stake , and Gillette said at the time that Mr. Buffett would be added to the board .
Separately , Gillette said its third-quarter earnings rose 2 % to $ 65.2 million , or 57 cents
a share , from $ 63.9 million , or 57 cents
a share , in the year-earlier period ; per-share earnings remained flat despite an increase in net income in part because the company paid a $ 10.4 million dividend on the new preferred stock in the period .
Sales rose 9 % to $ 921.6 million from $ 845.7 million , with sales of the company 's international\/diversified operations `` well above '' the year earlier-period .
For the nine months , Gillette 's net income declined 1 % to $ 205.3 million , or $ 2.02
a share , from $ 207 million , or $ 1.82
a share , in the 1988 period .
Sales rose 6 % to $ 2.77 billion from $ 2.61 billion .
In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange , the company closed yesterday at $ 45.50
a share , up 25 cents .
Douglas H. Miller , self-employed in the oil and gas securities business , was named chairman of this oil and gas exploration company , filling a vacancy .
Mr. Miller , who has been a Coda director , also was named chief executive officer , succeeding Ted Eubank , who remains president and chief operating officer .
This maker of electronic measuring devices named two new directors , increasing board membership to nine .
The new directors are Gordon M. Sprenger , president and chief executive officer of LifeSpan Inc. , and Peter S. Willmott , chairman and chief executive officer of Willmott Services Inc .
Eastern Airlines ' creditors committee backed off a move to come up with its own alternative proposals to the carrier 's bankruptcy reorganization plans , according to sources familiar with the committee .
In a meeting in New York yesterday , the committee put on hold instructions
it gave two weeks ago to its experts to explore other options for Eastern 's future , the sources said .
The consultants had been working to finish a report
That means Eastern , a unit of Texas Air Corp. of Houston , can go forward with its pitch for creditor approval as early as today , when it is expected to deliver a revised reorganization plan to the committee .
The committee intends to meet next week to make a recommendation on the new plan .
In another development yesterday , creditors were told that $ 40 million
they had expected to become available for implementing a reorganization may not materialize , according to one source .
Texas Air has run into difficulty reselling about $ 20 million of debt securities because of problems in the junk bond market , the person said .
And plans to raise another $ 20 million through changes to an insurance policy have hit a snag , the source said .
An Eastern spokesman said `` the $ 40 million will have no effect whatsoever on the asset structure of Eastern 's plan .
Forty million in the total scheme of things is not that significant .
It is unclear what caused the creditors to do an about-face on exploring alternatives to Eastern 's new reorganization plan .
However , since Eastern first filed for Chapter 11 protection March 9 , it has consistently promised to pay creditors 100 cents on the dollar .
Because the carrier is still pledging to do that , some committee members successfully argued that there
's little reason yet to explore a different plan , according to one person familiar with the creditors ' position .
the accounting firm of Ernst & Young and the securities firm of Goldman , Sachs & Co. , the experts hired by the creditors , contended that Eastern would have difficulty meeting earnings targets the airline was projecting .
Ernst & Young said Eastern 's plan would miss projections by $ 100 million .
Goldman said Eastern would miss the same mark by at least $ 120 million .
The consultants maintained Eastern would n't generate the cash
it needs and would have to issue new debt to meet its targets under the plan .
Eastern at the time disputed those assessments and called the experts ' report `` completely off base .
Yesterday , Joel Zweibel , an attorney for Eastern 's creditors committee , declined to comment on whether the experts had ever been instructed to look at other choices and whether they now were asked not to .
He said only that the committee has not yet taken any position on Eastern 's reorganization plan and that the two sides were still negotiating .
`` In every case , people would like to see a consentual plan , '' he said .
Eastern and its creditors agreed in July on a reorganization plan
that called for the carrier to sell off $ 1.8 billion in assets and to emerge from Chapter 11 status in late 1989 at two-thirds its former size .
Eastern eventually decided not to sell off a major chunk , its South American routes , which were valued at $ 400 million .
Such a change meant the reorganization plan the creditors had agreed on was no longer valid , and the two sides had to begin negotiating again .
Eastern has publicly stated it is exceeding its goals for getting back into operation and has predicted it would emerge from Chapter 11 proceedings early next year , operating more flights than it originally had scheduled .
The estimates of real gross national product prepared by the Bureau of Economic Analysis in the Department of Commerce significantly understate the rate of economic growth .
Since the bureau 's estimates for the business sector provide the numerator for the productivity ratios calculated by the Department of Labor , underestimated growth rates artificially depress official productivity statistics .
If this thesis is correct , it has important implications for macroeconomic policies : It may lower the sense of urgency behind efforts to enact tax incentives and other measures to increase the rate of growth in productivity and real GNP .
It would also affect the perceptions of the board of governors of the Federal Reserve System , and the informed public generally , as to what constitutes a reasonable degree of price stability .
In the early 1980s , I predicted a significant acceleration in productivity growth over the rest of the decade .
This forecast was based on the apparent reversal of most of the negative forces -- such as demographic changes , the oil shock and accelerating inflation -- that had reduced productivity gains in the 1970s .
There has indeed been more than a one percentage point improvement in productivity growth since 1981 .
But I had expected more , which is one reason
I began looking at evidence suggesting defects in the official output estimates .
The evidence does not clearly support the view that the downward bias in output growth has become greater during the 1948-89 period , but all
I am claiming is that the growth trend is understated .
( It is , however , possible , that further study will reveal increasing bias .
This bias is in no way deliberate .
The understatement of growth is due largely to the conservative expedients adopted to deal with deficiencies in basic economic data .
The first of three major sources of error is the use of labor input estimates ( mainly employment or hours ) instead of output estimates for those sectors , such as governments , paid household services and private non-profit institutions , where there are difficulties in assembling output data .
This means that no allowance is made for possible increases in output per unit of labor .
In an unrelated program in which
the Labor Department does estimate output per employee for more than two-thirds of federal civilian employees , it found an average annual rate of productivity improvement of 1.7 % during the 1980s .
Even if it is assumed that productivity rose no more than half as quickly in the rest of the nonbusiness sector , this Labor Department estimate indicates a downward bias in the real GNP estimates of 0.2 percentage point
a year , on average .
The federal productivity estimators use labor input , rather than output , data for their calculations of half of private financial and service industries as well .
Independent estimates of output in those industries , including one by the Department of Labor for banking , suggests that productivity in finance and services appears to have risen by an average of at least 1.5 %
a year between 1948 and 1988 .
Because finance and services contribute 10 % to final business product , missing these productivity improvements depresses the overall growth rate by 0.15 %
The second source of error in growth statistics is the use of inappropriate deflators to adjust for price changes .
I estimate that these mismeasurements as detailed by Martin N. Baily and Robert J. Gordon add a further 0.12 percentage point to the downward bias in the growth rate of real business product .
Finally , the official estimates understate growth because they make inadequate allowance for improvements in quality of goods and services .
In 1985 , a new price index for computers adjusted for changes in performance characteristics was introduced , and that resulted in a significantly larger increase in real outlays for durable goods than the earlier estimates had showed .
Since then , further research argues that failure to take account of quality improvements has contributed a total of at least 0.26 percentage point to the downward bias in the growth rate .
In sum , the biases ennumerated above indicate a 0.7 percentage point understatement in growth of total real GNP .
For the private domestic business economy , the bias was a bit over 0.5 percentage point .
In other words , the growth rates of both total GNP and real private business product per labor hour have been underestimated by about 20 % .

The government will try to sell all the real estate managed by the Federal Asset Disposition Association in one fell swoop , said William Seidman , chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp .
The FADA real-estate package , with an asking price of $ 428 million , is comprised of 150 properties in Texas , California , Colorado , Arizona and Florida .
It includes apartments , shopping centers , office buildings and undeveloped land .
Mr. Seidman is chairman of the Resolution Trust Corp. , established to sell or merge the nation 's hundreds of insolvent savings-and-loan associations .
The RTC , created by this year 's S&L bailout legislation , is trying to sell FADA 's network of offices separately .
FADA , which holds problem assets of thrifts
that were closed before the bailout legislation was enacted , is being liquidated .
The properties held by FADA wo n't be sold piecemeal , Mr. Seidman said in a speech before Southern Methodist University Business School in Dallas .

On June 30 , a major part of our trade deficit went poof !
No figure juggling ; no witchcraft ; just vastly improved recording of some of our exports .
The result ?
The Commerce Department found that U.S. exports in 1988 , net of imports , were understated by $ 20.9 billion
a year and understated at the annualized rate of $ 25.4 billion in the first quarter of 1989 .
More than half of the `` newly found '' net exports were from just a few service-sector categories .
Some of the biggest service-industry exporters -- American financial-service companies , for example -- have yet to be fully included in our export statistics .
Nearly 10 years ago , representatives of service-sector companies worked out a plan with the Commerce Department to improve the data on service-sector exports .
groups believed that tens of billions of dollars of service exports -- such as inbound tourism ; legal , accounting and other professional services furnished to foreigners ; financial , engineering and construction services ; and the like -- were not being counted as exports .
The monthly `` trade deficit '' figure is limited to traditional merchandise trade : manufactured goods and raw materials .
In the quarterly balance-of-payments report , those merchandise trade figures are merged with statistics on exports and imports of services , as well as returns on investments abroad by Americans and returns on foreign investments in the U.S .
Over time , through benchmark surveys , the corrected data on service exports and imports have been gathered .
The first three major areas of the service sector to be revamped were expenditures by foreign students in the U.S .
( net after expenditures by Americans studying abroad ) , some exports by professional firms ( a law firm billing a German client for services rendered in watching legislation in Washington is as much an export as shipment of an American jet engine ) , and improved data from travel and tourism .
In just these three areas , the Commerce Department found $ 23 billion more exports than previously reported and $ 11.6 billion more imports , with the net result that the U.S. service surplus in 1988 increased by $ 11.3 billion , to $ 19 billion .
Combined with recalculations and revisions in other trade areas , the value of U.S. net exports
that had not previously been recorded was about $ 20 billion
That means that the U.S. trade deficit was running closer to $ 75 billion than to $ 95 billion in 1988 , and $ 55 billion ( annualized ) rather than $ 80 billion in the first quarter of 1989 .
These revised figures also may explain some of the recent strength of the dollar .
The materially smaller trade deficit may have been already discounted in the market .
What does this mean for trade policy ?
Too early to tell , but a trade deficit
that is significantly smaller than we imagined does suggest a review of our trade posture .
It does not relieve the need for our market-opening efforts for both
goods and services , but it does suggest that it is our exports of services , and not just borrowing , that is financing our imports of goods .

Norfolk Southern Corp. directors authorized the railroad company to buy back as many as 45 million of its shares , which would have a current value of more than $ 1.7 billion .
The buy-back , coupled with a nearly completed earlier purchase of 20 million shares , would reduce shares outstanding by more than 26 % .
The Norfolk , Va. , company has 172.2 million shares outstanding .
In a statement , Arnold B. McKinnon , chairman and chief executive officer , noted that the new repurchase program `` should serve to enhance shareholder value .
'' A spokeswoman said the company will finance the buy-back with cash on hand , borrowing and `` cash Norfolk expects to generate .
Analysts said they expected the action , and investors applauded the move .
In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange , Norfolk Southern shares closed at $ 37.875 , up $ 1.125 .
Still , analysts do n't expect the buy-back to significantly affect per-share earnings in the short term .
`` The impact wo n't be that great , '' said Graeme Lidgerwood of First Boston Corp .
That is in part because of the effect of having to average the number of shares outstanding , she said .
In addition , Mrs. Lidgerwood said , Norfolk is likely to draw down its cash initially to finance the purchases and thus forfeit some interest income .
Longer term , however , the buy-back is expected to increase earnings , especially after 1990 , Mrs. Lidgerwood said .
Moreover , the extensive program in effect establishes a floor for the stock price , said Joel Price , analyst for Donaldson , Lufkin & Jenrette .
The buy-back `` is really a comfort to those
who want to buy the stock that there is a { price } floor , '' he said .
`` At a certain price , if the management thinks { the stock } is cheap , they can go in and buy it .
Under the program , Norfolk plans to acquire shares in the open market .
Under the earlier plan , Norfolk was authorized in 1987 to buy up to 20 million shares .
It has purchased about 19 million of them .

Stock-market fears and relatively more attractive interest rates pushed money-market mutual fund assets up $ 6.07 billion in the latest week , the sharpest increase in almost two years .
The 473 funds tracked by the Investment Company Institute , a Washington-based trade group , rose to $ 356.1 billion , a record .
The $ 6.07 billion increase was the strongest weekly inflow since January 1988 .
The increase was spread fairly evenly among all three types of funds .
Individual investors , represented in the general-purpose and broker-dealer fund categories , pulled money from the stock market after its big drop last Friday and put the money into funds , said Jacob Dreyer , vice president and chief economist of the Institute .
`` Insitutional investors , on the other hand , reacted to the steep decline in yields on direct money-market instruments following the stock-market decline last Friday , '' Mr. Dreyer said .
Yields on money funds dropped in the week ended Tuesday , according to Donoghue 's Money Fund Report , a Holliston , Mass. , newsletter .
The average seven-day compounded yield fell to 8.55 % from 8.60 %
the week earlier , Donoghue 's said .
At the auction of six-month U.S. Treasury bills on Monday , the average yield fell to 7.61 % from 7.82 % .
Likewise , certificates of deposit on average posted lower yields in the week ended Tuesday .
The 142 institutional-type money funds rose $ 2.23 billion to $ 85.49 billion .
The 235 general-purpose funds increased $ 2.53 billion to $ 116.56 billion , while 96 broker-dealer funds increased $ 1.3 billion to $ 154.05 billion .
At age eight , Josephine Baker was sent by her mother to a white woman 's house to do chores in exchange for meals and a place to sleep -- a place in the basement with the coal .
At age 19 , she was a Paris sensation , transformed from unwanted child to international sex symbol in just over a decade .
It is the stuff of dreams , but also of traumas .
Only the bravest spirits survive such roller coasters .
And , for Ms. Baker , the ride was far from over .
Her bare breasts , her dancing , her voice , her beauty and , perhaps most famously , her derriere , were prominent attractions , but courage of a rare sort made her remarkable life possible .
Bricktop , another American black woman
who found a measure of fame in Paris , said : `` I do n't think I 've ever known anyone with a less complicated view of life , or whose life was more complicated than Josephine 's .
Men were a constant complication .
Baker had lots of them .
But she did n't trust them and did n't reward trust .
As she saw one key love affair , the problem was n't her infidelity , it was his jealousy .
Her appetite for children also was large .
She adopted 12 of assorted races , naming them
the Rainbow Tribe , and driving her husband first to despair and then to Argentina .
She made money , but spent more .
Friends pitched in .
Finally , Prince Rainier and Princess Grace saved her with the offer of a house in Monaco .
Another lifelong complication , as Phyllis Rose makes clear in `` Jazz Cleopatra : Josephine Baker in Her Time '' ( Doubleday , 321 pages , $ 22.50 ) , was racism .
Baker had the good luck to arrive in 1925 Paris , where blacks had become exotic .
African art was in vogue and some intellectuals were writing breathlessly of a dawning age to be inspired by blacks .
To be exotic was to be patronized as well as prized , but for the most part Paris was a friendly island in a racist world .
Baker had bitter experience of bigotry from her St. Louis childhood and her days in New York theater , where she was judged too dark for an all-black chorus line ( performing of course for all-white audiences ) .
Paris loved her at first sight .
`` She just wiggled her fanny and all the French fell in love with her , '' sniffed the literary world 's Maria Jolas , not entirely inaccurately .
`` One can hardly overemphasize the importance of her rear end , '' Ms. Rose writes .
Ms. Rose , who teaches literature at Wesleyan University , quickly proceeds to overemphasize , claiming that Baker 's dancing `` had uncovered a new region for desire '' and thereby ignoring centuries of tributes to the callipygous .
`` Jazz Cleopatra '' contains other , more important , false notes
that undermine what is , for the most part , a lively account of a life already familiar from earlier works .
It is easy to see why Baker , a free spirit
who broke many of the restraints convention places on women , attracts Ms. Rose , the author of `` Parallel Lives , '' a wonderful study of Victorian marriage .
Still , even the title raises questions about the author 's vision of her subject .
Baker 's art was jazz only by the widest stretch of the term .
To find parallels , other than sexual appeal , with Cleopatra , requires an equal stretch .
Baker was 68 years old when she died in Paris , two days after the sold-out opening of her newest show : a movie-like ending to what was a cinematic life .
In fact , Ms. Baker played scenes in Casablanca
that could have made it into `` Casablanca .
During World War II , her uncomplicated view of life led her to the conclusion that the Nazis were evil and must be resisted , a decision made by only about 2 % of French citizens .
She was devoted to Charles de Gaulle 's cause , accepting great financial sacrifice and considerable risk to become first a spy and then a one-woman USO tour for the forces of Free France .
In Humphrey Bogart 's nightclub , Victor Laszlo leads Free French sympathizers in `` La Marseillaise '' to drown out the Nazis .
The night
the Germans occupied all of France , Baker performed in Casablanca .
The Free French wore black arm bands , and when she sang `` J'ai deux amours '' they wept .
Ms. Rose is best on the early years and World War II .
In her introduction , Ms. Rose writes that she feels she has much in common with Baker , but as `` Jazz Cleopatra '' goes on , it seems more rushed , as though the author were growing less interested .
It does n't help that sometimes Ms. Rose 's language fails to deliver the effect
she appears to want .
One chapter opens : `` World War II was not one of France 's glorious moments .
Elsewhere , in an attempt to explain without stating it plainly that Baker had a large gay following later in her career when she was an overdressed singer rather than underdressed dancer , Ms. Rose writes : `` She was a female impersonator
who happened to be a woman .
One devoted fan
who fell under Baker 's spell in 1963 and began collecting Baker memorabilia was Bryan Hammond .
In `` Josephine Baker '' ( Jonathan Cape , 304 pages , $ 35 ) , which was published in Britain last year and distributed in the U.S.
this month , Mr. Hammond has used his collection to produce an album of photographs and drawings of the star .
The text by Patrick O'Connor is a tough read , but the pictures make her magnetism clear and help explain why Ernest Hemingway called Baker `` The most sensational woman
anybody ever saw .
Or ever will .

A group of shareholders filed suit against Imperial Corp. of America , Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. , First Executive Corp. and others , charging them with artificially inflating Imperial 's stock price to protect certain major investors .
The complaint , filed in federal district court , accuses Imperial and other defendants of issuing false and misleading financial data .
It also charges that Imperial , the holding company for Imperial Savings & Loan , experienced major losses and writedowns because of improper assessment of the risks of junk-bond investments and wholesale consumer loan packages .
The suit seeks unspecified damages .
Imperial is in the midst of reducing its junk-bond holdings and getting out of the investment banking business in order to return to traditional thrift activities .
The derivative suit is similar to a class-action complaint filed earlier this year .
Imperial said in a statement
it expects other complaints to be filed in the wake of the original suit and a recent article in Barron 's magazine
that focused on the company 's problems .
Although an Imperial spokesman said the company had n't yet been served with the derivative suit , he reiterated the company 's statement that it would vigorously defend itself against the class-action suit .
Spokesmen at Drexel and First Executive said the companies had n't yet been served with the suit .
In a separate complaint also filed in federal court here , shareholder Max Grill of New York charged Imperial , its top executives and directors with breach of fiduciary duty and squandering the company 's assets .
Imperial said it had n't been served with this suit either .
Applied Solar Energy Corp. of City of Industry , Calif. , said it and its majority shareholder , American Cyanamid Co. , signed a non-binding letter of intent for the acquisition of Applied Solar by McDonnell Douglas Corp. for about $ 38 million .
The proposed acquisition provides for a cash payment of $ 10
a share at closing and a contingent payment of as much as 80 cents
a share placed in escrow .
Details of the escrow agreement have n't been completed , the companies said .
There are 3.5 million shares of Applied Solar , of which
American Cyanamid owns 2.7 million .
American Cyanamid is a Wayne , N.J. , chemicals , drugs and fertilizer concern .
Completion of the acquisition is subject to execution of a definitive agreement , approval by all three companies ' boards and the approval of Applied Solar 's shareholders .
An Applied Solar spokesman said completion is expected at the end of the year or early next year .
A spokeswoman for the St. Louis aerospace and defense concern said it wanted the acquistion because Applied Solar is involved in solar cells and solid-state laser components , and this fits with McDonnell 's business of laser applications for military space .
American Brands Inc. said third-quarter net income rose 13 % , reflecting strong gains in its tobacco and distilled spirits businesses .
The company , which also has businesses in life insurance , office products and hardware , and home-improvement products , said net income rose to $ 166.4 million , or $ 1.71

The Bakersfield Supermarket went out of business last May .
The reason was not high interest rates or labor costs .
Nor was there a shortage of customers in the area , the residential Inwood section of northern Manhattan .
The business closed when the owner was murdered by robbers .
The owner was Israel Ortiz , a 29-year-old entrepreneur and father of two .
In his first year of operating the store
he bought for $ 220,000 , Mr. Ortiz was robbed at least twice at gunpoint .
The first time
he was shot in the hand as he chased the robbers outside .
The second time
he identified two robbers , who were arrested and charged .
Two weeks later -- perhaps in retaliation -- Mr. Ortiz was shot three times in the back , during what police classified as a third robbery attempt .
That was his reward for working until 11 p.m. seven days
a week to cover his $ 3,000
a month rent .
For providing what
his customers described as very personal and helpful service .
For creating a focus for neighborhood life .
Israel Ortiz is only one of the thousands of entrepreneurs and their employees
who will be injured or killed by crime
The U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics reports that almost 2 % of all retail-sales workers suffer injuries from crime
each year , almost twice the national average and about four times
the rate for teachers , truck drivers , medical workers and door-to-door salespeople .
Only a few other occupations have higher reported rates of criminal injury , such as police , bartenders and taxi drivers .
Yet these figures show only the most visible part of the problem .
Recent data from New York City provide more of the picture .
While by no means
the highest crime community in the country , New York is a prime example of a city where crime strangles small-business development .
A survey of small businesses there was conducted this spring by Interface , a policy research organization .
It gave 1,124 businesses
a questionnaire and analyzed 353 responses .
The survey found that over a three-year period 22 % of the firms said employees or owners had been robbed on their way to or from work or while on the job .
Seventeen percent reported their customers being robbed .
Crime was the reason that 26 % reported difficulty recruiting personnel and that 19 % said they were considering moving .
More than one-third of the responding businesses said they suffer from drug dealing and loitering near their premises .
In Brooklyn and the Bronx , one out of four commercial firms is burglarized each year .
Industrial neighborhoods fare even worse , with burglary rates twice the citywide average .
Crime is clearly more deadly to small-scale entrepreneurship than to big businesses .
Two decades ago , the Small Business Administration reported Yale Prof. Albert Reiss 's landmark study of crime against 2,500 small businesses drawn from national IRS records .
He found that monetary crime losses , as a proportion of gross receipts , were 37 times higher for small businesses than for large ones .
The New York study 's companies averaged 27 employees ; their annual crime losses averaged about $ 15,000 , with an additional $ 8,385 annual cost in security -- enough money to hire at least one more worker .
The costs of crime may also be enough to destroy a struggling business .
the monetary crime losses , they may not be nearly as important to entrepreneurs as the risk of personal injury .
After repeated gun robberies , some entrepreneurs may give up a business out of fear for their lives .
One Washington couple recently sold their liquor store after 34 years in business
that included four robbery deaths and 16 robberies or burglaries on the premises .
These findings illustrate the vicious cycle that National Institute of Justice Director James K. Stewart calls `` crime causing poverty .
'' Underclass neighborhoods offer relatively few employment opportunities , contributing to the poverty of local residents .
Small neighborhood businesses could provide more jobs , if crime were not so harmful to creating and maintaining those businesses .
This may help explain why small businesses create 65 % of all jobs nationally , but only 22 % of jobs in a crime-ridden city like New York .
Bigger business can often better afford to minimize the cost of crime .
The New York study found that the cost of security measures in firms with fewer than five employees was almost $ 1,000 per worker , compared with one-third
that amount for firms with more than 10 employees .
The shift of retailing to large shopping centers has created even greater economies of scale for providing low-crime business environments .
Private security guards and moonlighting police can invoke the law of trespass to regulate access to these quasi-public places .
Since 1984 , in fact , revenues of the 10 largest guard companies , primarily serving such big businesses , have increased by almost 62 % .
Few small neighborhood businesses , however , can afford such protection , even in collaboration with other local merchants .
In the neighborhoods with the highest crime rates , small business generally relies on the public police force for protection .
This creates several problems .
One is that there are not enough police to satisfy small businesses .
The number one proposal for reducing crime in the New York survey was to put more police on foot or scooter patrol , suggested by more than two-thirds of the respondents .
Only 22 % supported private security patrols funded by the merchants themselves .
A second problem is the persistent frustration of false alarms , which can make urban police less than enthusiastic about responding to calls from small businesses .
Only half the New York small businesses surveyed , for their part , are satisfied with the police response
they receive .
Some cities , including New York , have experimented with special tax districts for commercial areas
that provide additional patrols funded by local businesses .
But this raises added cost barriers to urban entrepreneurship .
Another solution cities might consider is giving special priority to police patrols of small-business areas .
For cities losing business to suburban shopping centers , it may be a wise business investment to help keep those jobs and sales taxes within city limits .
Increased patrolling of business zones makes sense because urban crime is heavily concentrated in such `` hot spots '' of pedestrian density .
With National Institute of Justice support , the Minneapolis police and the Crime Control Institute are currently testing the effects of such a strategy , comparing its deterrence value with traditional random patrols .
Small-business patrols would be an especially helpful gesture whenever a small-business person is scheduled to testify against a robbery suspect .
While no guarantee , an increased police presence might even deter further attacks .
It might even have saved the life , and business , of Israel Ortiz .

Calgon Carbon Corp. said it will build a $ 40 million plant for producing granular activated carbon .
The maker of water-treatment chemicals and equipment said it will select the plant site early next year , and production is expected to begin in 1991 .
Sony Corp. asked a Los Angeles court to deny Warner Communications Inc. 's request for an injunction preventing Hollywood producers Peter Guber and John Peters from taking over the management of Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc .
The Japanese concern made its request in Los Angeles Superior Court , where Warner last week filed a $ 1 billion breach of contract suit against Sony .
Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters are currently under contract to produce movies exclusively for Warner .
Sony , which has agreed to pay $ 3.5 billion and to assume $ 1.5 billion in debt to buy Columbia , is also offering $ 200 million for Guber Peters Entertainment Co. , of which
the producers are co-chairmen and own a combined 28 % stake .
While executives from both
sides say the matter still could be settled , papers filed in the court by Sony appear to heighten the acrimony of Hollywood 's most-watched legal battle .
Sony claims an injunction would leave it `` faced with the ominous possibility that it would complete a $ 5 billion entertainment company acquisition and be left with no management to run the company .
'' Sony adds that `` Warner must be grinning from ear to ear at the possibility of leaving Sony in such a position and at the opportunity to prevent the revitalization of Columbia into a strong competitor .
Sony disputes Warner 's contention that its offer to Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters violates their contract with Warner , which is in the process of being acquired by New York-based Time Warner Inc .
Furthermore , Sony claims that the contract as written -- and oral agreements that Warner has denied exist -- allow the producers to take on such executive posts .
Sony 's legal argument even raises the novel idea that Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters could actually make movies for Warner while serving in executive posts at another studio .
Sony acknowledges that Warner 's contract prevents the Guber-Peters team from being producers or executive producers of movies for another studio .
But , Sony says , that does n't exclude them from taking an executive post at another company where they would be involved in choosing movies and in managing , but not in day-to-day production of movies .
Sony says Columbia `` could allow Guber and Peters to produce motion pictures for Warner as soon as the acquisition is consummated .
But Sony also says in its filing that the Warner contract `` does n't require that Guber and Peters take any affirmative steps to produce motion pictures ; it simply rewards them when they do and prohibits them from producing for another entertainment company .
'' And Sony says Warner has already shown it does n't need the producers `` by taking action to prevent Guber and Peters from completing production in Warner properties .
Among the arguments Sony makes is that Warner should let the producers go to Columbia because it already allowed the producers to become co-chairmen of publicly held Barris Industries Inc. , which earlier this year changed its name to Guber Peters Entertainment .
Sony also says in its filing that Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters were offered management posts at Columbia once before in 1987 , and that `` Warner approved and encouraged them to do so .
But in a sworn affidavit last week , Warner Bros. Chairman Robert Daly denied that .
Mr. Daly said that Mr. Guber had mentioned such an offer , and that he responded that `` I thought the idea was a bad one from his point of view , and I understand he dropped the idea shortly thereafter .
The two sides did some rival-bashing yesterday as well .
In a sworn declaration , Walter Yetnikoff , president of Sony 's CBS Records unit , said Warner Chairman Steven Ross has an `` anti-Japanese , anti-Sony '' bias .
But Stuart Rabinowitz , Warner 's outside counsel , says Sony `` violates American business morality by secretly raiding major producers under exclusive contract to Warner .
In another sworn declaration yesterday , Sony Corp. of America Vice Chairman Michael Schulof said that while he was negotiating with Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters , he relied on the producers ' assurances that Warner had previously agreed to let them terminate the contract and would n't have any trouble obtaining a release .
Mr. Guber , meanwhile , in his own sworn declaration yesterday , maintained that running a studio has always been `` our professed goal , '' and that Warner executives made an oral agreement
that would free the producers from their contract should the opportunity arise .
Mr. Peters , in his declaration , supported Mr. Guber 's claims and said he is `` shocked '' by the assertions of Warner executives that such an agreement was never made .
Some Democrats in Congress are warning that a complicated new funding device for the two federal antitrust agencies could result in further cutbacks in a regulatory area already reduced sharply in recent years .
The funding mechanism , which has received congressional approval and is expected to be signed by President Bush , would affect the antitrust operations of the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission .
As a part of overall efforts to reduce spending , Congress cut by $ 30 million
the Bush administration 's request for antitrust enforcement for fiscal 1990 , which began Oct. 1 .
To offset the reduction , Congress approved a $ 20,000 fee that investors and companies will have to pay each time
they make required filings to antitrust regulators about mergers , acquisitions and certain other transactions .
Some Democrats , led by Rep. Jack Brooks ( D. , Texas ) , unsuccessfully opposed the measure because they fear that the fees may not fully make up for the budget cuts .
But Justice Department and FTC officials said they expect the filing fees to make up for the budget reductions and possibly exceed them .
`` It could operate to augment our budget , '' James Rill , the Justice Department 's antitrust chief , said in an interview .
Under measures approved by both
houses of Congress , the administration 's request for $ 47 million for the Antitrust Division would be cut $ 15 million .
The FTC budget request of $ 70 million , about $ 34 million of which would go for antitrust enforcement , would also be cut by $ 15 million .
The administration had requested roughly the same amount for antitrust enforcement for fiscal 1990 as was appropriated in fiscal 1989 .
The offsetting fees would apply to filings made under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act .
Under that law , parties proposing mergers or acquisitions valued at $ 15 million or more must notify FTC and Justice Department antitrust regulators before completing the transactions .
Currently , the government charges nothing for such filings .
Proponents of the funding arrangement predict that , based on recent filing levels of more than 2,000
a year , the fees will yield at least $ 40 million this fiscal year , or $ 10 million more than the budget cuts .
`` When you do that , there is not a cut , but there is in fact
a program increase of $ 5 million '' each for the FTC and the Justice Department , Rep. Neal Smith ( D. , Iowa ) said during House debate .
But Rep. Don Edwards ( D. , Calif .
) responded that a recession could stifle merger activity , reducing the amount of fees collected .
The antitrust staffs of both
the FTC and Justice Department were cut more than 40 % in the Reagan administration , and enforcement of major merger cases fell off drastically during that period .
`` Today is not the time to signal that Congress in any way sanctions the dismal state into which
antitrust enforcement has fallen , '' Mr. Edwards argued .
Any money in excess of $ 40 million collected from the fees in fiscal 1990 would go to the Treasury at large .
Corporate lawyers said the new fees would n't inhibit many mergers or other transactions .
Though some lawyers reported that prospective acquirers were scrambling to make filings before the fees take effect , government officials said they had n't noticed any surge in filings .
Armstrong World Industries Inc. agreed in principle to sell its carpet operations to Shaw Industries Inc .
The price was n't disclosed but one analyst estimated that it was $ 150 million .
Armstrong , which has faced a takeover threat from the Belzberg family of Canada since July , said that disposing of the carpet business would improve `` total financial performance .
'' The move also would allow the company to concentrate on core businesses , which include ceramic tile , floor coverings and furniture .
Moreover , such a sale could help Armstrong reassure its investors and deter the Belzbergs , who own a 9.85 % stake in the Lancaster , Pa. , company .
Analysts expect Armstrong to use proceeds of the sale to reduce debt , buy back stock or perhaps finance an acquisition .
The carpet division had 1988 sales of $ 368.3 million , or almost 14 % of Armstrong 's $ 2.68 billion total revenue .
The company has been manufacturing carpet since 1967 .
Recently it upgraded its plants so that it could make stain-resistant products with higher quality dyes .
For the past year or two , the carpet division 's operating profit margins have hovered around 5 % , high by industry standards , but disappointing compared with the 13 % to 19 % margins for two of Armstrong 's chief businesses , flooring and building products .
Analysts hailed the planned transaction as being beneficial to Armstrong and Shaw , the market leader in the U.S. carpet industry , with an estimated 17 % to 20 % share .
Shaw , based in Dalton , Ga. , has annual sales of about $ 1.18 billion , and has economies of scale and lower raw-material costs
that are expected to boost the profitability of Armstrong 's brands , sold under the Armstrong and Evans-Black names .
Yesterday , in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange , Shaw 's shares closed ex-dividend at $ 26.125 , up $ 2.25 .
Armstrong 's shares , also listed on the Big Board , closed at $ 39.125 , up 12.5 cents .
Yesterday , Armstrong reported flat earnings for the third quarter and nine months , worsened by the stock dilution of an employee stock ownership plan adopted earlier this year .
For the quarter , earnings were $ 47 million , or 92 cents
a share , including a one-time gain of $ 5.9 million .
In the year-ago quarter , earnings were $ 42.9 million , or 93 cents
Yesterday , Armstrong announced an agreement to sell its small Applied Color Systems unit to a subsidiary of the Swiss company , Brauerei Eichof Ltd .
Armstrong expects to close the sale of the color unit in late November and the carpet sale in December , with the gains to be applied to fourth quarter or first-quarter results .
TW Services Inc. posted a $ 3.3 million third-quarter net loss , compared with a $ 24.9 million profit , reflecting $ 60 million of expenses related to its much-publicized proposed takeover by Coniston Partners .
The per-share loss for the Paramus , N.J. , food-services concern totaled seven cents , compared with earnings of 51 cents
Revenue rose 5 % to $ 981.7 million from $ 934.7 million .
Coniston , a New York investment partnership , awaits a vote by TW 's shareholders , scheduled for Friday , on Coniston 's $ 34-a-share , or $ 1.66 billion , offer for TW .
Nine-month net income dropped 47 % to $ 26.3 million , or 54 cents
a share , from $ 49.7 million , or $ 1.02
Revenue rose 6 % to $ 2.79 billion from $ 2.63 billion .

Ferro Corp. said it will buy back as many as one million common shares .
The maker of chemical and industrial materials did n't say how much
it would pay or when it would make the transactions .
Ferro also said it would cancel the unused portion of a 1987 buy-back plan for administrative reasons .
The plan calls for the company to buy back 2,250,000 shares , which reflects a 3-for-2 stock split this year .
So far the company had bought back 1.6 million shares .
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday , Ferro closed at $ 25.25 , down 50 cents .
Tom Panelli had a perfectly good reason for not using the $ 300 rowing machine
he bought three years ago .
`` I ate a bad tuna sandwich , got food poisoning and had to have a shot in my shoulder , '' he says , making it too painful to row .
The soreness , he admits , went away about a week after the shot .
Yet the rowing machine has n't been touched since , even though he has moved it across the country with him twice .
A San Francisco lawyer , Mr. Panelli rowed religiously when he first got the machine , but , he complains , it left grease marks on his carpet , `` and it was boring .
It 's a horrible machine , actually .
I 'm ashamed I own the stupid thing .
Mr. Panelli has plenty of company .
Nearly three-fourths of the people
who own home exercise equipment do n't use it as much as they planned , according to The Wall Street Journal 's `` American Way of Buying '' survey .
The Roper Organization , which conducted the survey , said almost half of the exercise equipment owners found it duller than they expected .
It is n't just exercise gear
that is n't getting a good workout .
The fitness craze
itself has gone soft , the survey found .
Fewer people said they were working up a sweat with such activities as jogging , tennis , swimming and aerobics .
Half of those surveyed said they simply walk these days for exercise .
That 's good news for marketers of walking shoes .
The survey also detected a bit more interest in golf , a positive sign for country clubs and golf club makers .
The survey 's findings certainly are n't encouraging for marketers of health-club memberships , tennis rackets and home exercise equipment , but people 's good intentions , if not their actions , are keeping sales of some fitness products healthy .
For instance , sales of treadmills , exercise bikes , stair climbers and the like are expected to rise 8 % to about $ 1.52 billion this year , according to the National Sporting Goods Association , which sees the home market as one of the hottest growth areas for the 1990s .
But even that group knows some people do n't use their machines as much as they should .
`` The first excuse is they do n't have enough time , '' says research director Thomas Doyle .
`` The second is they do n't have enough discipline .
'' With more than 15 million exercise bikes sold in the past five years , he adds , `` a lot of garages , basements and attics must be populated with them .
Still , the average price of such bikes rose last year to $ 145 .
Mr. Doyle predicts a trend toward fewer pieces of home exercise equipment being sold at higher prices .
Electronic gimmicks are key .
Premark International Inc. , for example , peddles the M8.7sp Electronic Cycling Simulator , a $ 2,000 stationary cycle .
On a video screen , riders can see 30 different `` rides , '' including urban , mountain and desert scenes , and check how many calories are burned a minute .
Nancy Igdaloff , who works in corporate payments at Bank of America in San Francisco , may be a good prospect for such a gizmo .
She 's trying to sell a $ 150 exercise bike
she bought about five years ago for her roommate .
But rather than write off home fitness equipment , she traded up : Ms. Igdaloff just paid about $ 900 for a fancier stationary bike , with a timer , dials showing average and maximum speeds and a comfortable seat
that feels almost like a chair .
`` I 'm using it
a lot , '' she says .
`` I spent so much money that if I look at it , and I 'm not on it , I feel guilty .
The poll points up some inconsistencies between what people say and what
they do .
A surprising 78 % of people said they exercise regularly , up from 73 % in 1981 .
This conjures up images of a nation full of trim , muscular folks , and suggests couch potatoes are out of season .
Of course , that is n't really the case .
The discrepancy may be because asking people about their fitness regime is a bit like inquiring about their love life .
They 're bound to exaggerate .
`` People say they swim , and that may mean they 've been to the beach
this year , '' says Krys Spain , research specialist for the President 's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports .
`` It 's hard to know if people are responding truthfully .
People are too embarrassed to say they have n't done anything .
While she applauds the fact that more Americans are getting up from the television to stroll or garden , she says the percentage of Americans
who do `` real exercise to build the heart '' is only 10 % to 20 % .
So many people fudge on answers about exercise , the president 's council now uses specific criteria to determine what is considered vigorous : It must produce contractions of large muscle groups , must achieve 60 % of maximum aerobic capacity and must be done three or more times
a week for a minimum of 20 minutes .
One of the council 's goals , set in 1980 , was to see more than 60 % of adults under 65 years of age getting vigorous exercise by 1990 .
That target has been revised to 30 % by the year 2000 .
But even that goal may prove optimistic .
Of 14 activities , the Journal survey found that 12 -- including bicycling , skiing and swimming -- are being done by fewer Americans today than eight years ago .
Time pressures and the ebb of the fitness fad are cited as reasons for the decline .
Only walking and golf increased in popularity during the 1980s -- and only slightly .
Jeanette Traverso , a California lawyer , gave up running three times
a week to play a weekly round of golf , finding it more social and serene .
It 's an activity
she feels she can do for life , and by pulling a golf cart , she still gets a good workout .
`` I 'm really wiped out after walking five hours , '' she says .
Most people said they exercise both for health and enjoyment .
`` If you sit down all the time , you 'll go stiff , '' says Joyce Hagood , a Roxboro , N.C. , homemaker
who walks several miles
a week .
`` And it 's relaxing .
Sometimes , if you have a headache , you can go out and walk it right off .
Only about a quarter of the respondents said they exercise to lose weight .
Slightly more , like Leslie Sherren , a law librarian in San Francisco
who attends dance aerobics five times
a week , exercise to relieve stress .
`` Working with lawyers , '' she says , `` I need it .
But fully 90 % of those polled felt they did n't need to belong to a health club .
`` They 're too crowded , and everybody 's showing off , '' says Joel Bryant , a 22-year-old student from Pasadena , Calif .
`` The guys are being macho , and the girls are walking around in little things .
They 're not there to work out .
But at least they show up .
Nearly half of those
who joined health clubs said they did n't use their membership as often as they planned .
Feeling they should devote more time to their families or their jobs , many yuppies are skipping their once-sacred workout .
Even so , the Association of Quality Clubs , a health-club trade group in Boston , says membership revenues will rise about 5 %
this year from last year 's $ 5 billion .
A spokeswoman adds , however , that the group is considering offering `` a behavior-modification course , similar to a smoking-cessation program , to teach people ways to stay with it .
There are die-hard bodies , of course .
The proprietor of Sante West , an aerobics studio in San Francisco 's Marina district , which was hit hard by the earthquake , says , `` People were going nuts
the minute
we opened , '' three days after the quake .
`` The emotional aspect is so draining , they needed a good workout .
Perhaps the most disturbing finding is that the bowling alley may be an endangered American institution .
The survey reported the number of people
who said they
bowl regularly has fallen to just 8 % from 17 % in 1981 .
The American Bowling Congress claims a higher percentage of the public bowls regularly , but concedes its membership has declined this decade .
To find out why , the group recently commissioned a study of the past 20 years of bowling-related research .
Three reasons were pinpointed : a preference for watching bowling and other sports on television rather than actually bowling , dowdy bowling centers , and dissatisfaction with bowling itself .
who start bowling expecting it to be a pleasurable exercise `` have been generally disappointed , '' the report said .
But not Richard Cottrell , a San Francisco cab driver
who bowls in two weekly leagues .
He hit the lanes three years ago on the advice of his doctor .
`` It 's good exercise , '' he says .
`` I ca n't do anything score-wise , but I like meeting the girls .
'' He says bowling helps him shed pounds , though that effort is sometimes thwarted by the fact that `` when I 'm drinking , I bowl better .
'' His Tuesday night team , the Leftovers , is in first place .
Sun Microsystems Inc. , a computer maker , announced the effectiveness of its registration statement for $ 125 million of 6 3\/8 % convertible subordinated debentures due Oct. 15 , 1999 .
The company said the debentures are being issued at an issue price of $ 849 for each $ 1,000 principal amount and are convertible at any time prior to maturity at a conversion price of $ 25
The debentures are available through Goldman , Sachs & Co .
Jim Pattison Industries Ltd. , one of a group of closely held companies owned by entrepreneur James Pattison , said it `` intends to seek control '' of 30%-owned Innopac Inc. , a Toronto packaging concern .
Jim Pattison Industries , a holding company with annual sales of about C$ 1.9 billion , largely from car dealerships and grocery stores , did n't elaborate on the statement , and a company official declined further comment .
The company said it currently holds about 4.2 million of Innopac 's 13.8 million common shares outstanding , which have an aggregate market value of about 137.8 million Canadian dollars ( US$ 117.3 million ) .
Separately , Innopac reported a fourth-quarter loss of about C$ 2.6 million , or 18 Canadian cents
a share , reflecting inventory write-downs .
The results made net income for the year ended Aug. 31 C$ 2.7 million , or 20 Canadian cents
a share , down from C$ 9.7 million , or 70 Canadian cents
a share last year .
Revenue was C$ 291.6 million , up from C$ 252 million in 1988 .
Martin Fabi , Innopac 's president and chief executive , said Innopac viewed Mr. Pattison 's decision to seek control as a `` very positive '' move .
`` I 'm happy that he feels positively about our company , '' he said .
Mr. Fabi would n't say directly whether Mr. Pattison has disclosed potential terms for his planned bid for control .
Among other things , Innopac is involved in recycling polystyrene foam products
that are often used by fast food chains , such as McDonald 's Corp. , for food packaging .
A joint venture involving units of Innopac and Mobil Corp. earlier this year opened the first U.S. polystyrene recycling plant , in Leominster , Mass .
In Poland 's rapid shift from socialism to an undefined alternative , environmental issues have become a cutting edge of broader movements to restructure
the economy , cut cumbersome bureaucracies , and democratize local politics .
Initial steps were taken at Poland 's first international environmental conference , which
I attended last month .
The conference , held in Lower Silesia , was co-sponsored by the Environment Ministry , the Rockefeller Brothers Fund , and the Polish Ecological Club , and was attended by 50 Poles from government and industry , as well as Hungarians , Czechs , Russians , Japanese and Americans .
The conference was entitled `` Economic Mechanisms for Environmental Protection , '' a significant departure from East Bloc usage , which recognizes only one economic mechanism -- central planning -- to direct industrial behavior .
Even more remarkably , it focused on emissions trading and similar market approaches to address pollution , notwithstanding Poland 's lack of functioning markets .
Why did East Bloc participants unanimously endorse market-based pollution approaches ?
The answer lies both in the degraded environment of these countries and the perceived causes of that degradation .
Like other East Bloc countries , Poland possesses environmental laws more honored in their breach than in their observance .
According to a detailed report by Zbigniew Bochniarz of the University of Minnesota 's Hubert Humphrey Institute , 27 areas containing a third of Poland 's population are regarded as `` ecological hazards '' due to multiple violations of standards .
Norms are consistently exceeded at 60 % of nitrogen oxide monitoring sites and 80 % of those for dust and soot emissions .
Four-fifths of Poland 's soils have become highly acidified ; 70 % of its southern forests are projected to die by century 's end .
Between 1965 and 1985 , Polish waters fit for human consumption dropped from 33 % to 6 % of all surface waters , while those unfit even for industry use nearly doubled .
Poland produces about 20 times more soot and five times more sulfur dioxide and solid waste per unit of gross national product than does Western Europe .
Its mortality rate for males over 35 is about 50 % higher than West Germany 's , and 50 % higher in hazard areas than the national average .
Since 1978 , average annual growth rates for most pollutants have outstripped
the growth of GNP .
Conference participants saw these effects as flowing directly from ( a ) Marxist devaluation of environmental resources , which are not produced by labor ; ( b ) planned economies ' inability to control pollution where enterprises are state-owned and penalties are paid by the government ; and ( c ) the continuing Stalinist emphasis on heavy industry for economic development , producing a far heavier and more wasteful use of energy and natural resources than in the West .
They repeatedly noted that environmental progress could not be secured without true ownership , genuine competition based on market factors , and the risk of bankruptcy if a business makes the wrong decisions .
The solutions they formally proposed included lead\/sulfur taxes , conservation and recycling incentives , reforestation offsets , transferable pollution permits , an ecological bank to finance pollution-reduction credits , and debt-for-environment swaps .
But their most fundamental recommendation was to separate industry from the state , making it fully accountable for pollution control .
A revolution takes more than conference manifestos .
Indeed , skepticism was amply captured by a joke told by Poles at the conference : `` The world must be coming to an end .
The Russians are talking peace .
The Palestinians are talking elections .
And the Poles are engaged in commerce .
'' But the implications of such a shift to market approaches go well beyond the fact that Poland is already working on nationwide emissions trades to reduce smelter pollution , or that the Soviets plan to introduce marketable pollution permits in some republics next year .
Those implications include :
-- Privatization .
Faced with a $ 40 billion foreign debt and skyrocketing inflation , Poland must privatize industry and eliminate subsidies to stabilize its currency and qualify for international assistance .
Market-based pollution control may consume some capital
that would otherwise purchase state industries .
But it could also accelerate `` marketization '' by reinforcing industrial accountability , breaking up state monopolies , giving managers
a stake in solutions , and ensuring that modernization is not reversible for failure to address environmental effects .
-- Least-cost solutions .
As conferees noted , scarce capital means the costs of control must be minimized through a broad menu of compliance choices for individual firms .
That means simple , clear rules
that secure the first large blocks of reduction , deferring more complex issues such as risk .
It also means use of quantity-based pollution limits such as transferable permits , rather than price-based limits such as effluent fees .
That 's because quota-trained managers will likely respond better to quantity than to price signals .
-- Creative financing .
Even least-cost environmental solutions will require billions of dollars .
New types of financing must make funds available without draining Poland 's hard-currency reserves .
-- Democratization .
East Bloc pollution data typically have been state secrets .
While Polish data have been freely available since 1980 , it was no accident that participants urged the free flow of information .
For once information flows , public participation follows and repression becomes difficult to reimpose .
-- Global reciprocity .
One participant prematurely declared that America has had a free market in goods but a planned economy for environmental protection , while Poland represents the opposite .
His point : It will be increasingly difficult for the U.S. to cling to command-and-control measures if even the East Bloc steps to a different drummer .
At the moment , Poland resembles 19th-century Pittsburgh more than a modern industrial society -- with antiquated production , inadequate environmental management , and little ecological awareness .
But the continuing pressures for free-market economics suggest the conference 's vision was not all fantasy .

Apogee Enterprises Inc. said profit for the third quarter ending Dec. 2 will fall below the year-earlier results because of an after-tax charge of $ 1.9 million related to a project
that was guaranteed by the company .
A year ago , the Minneapolis glass products and aluminum window maker earned $ 4 million , or 30 cents
a share , on revenue of $ 114 million .
Apogee said the charge stems from a building supply contract in which
the company guaranteed a contractor 's performance .
Apogee said a subcontractor had severe cost overruns and was unable to fulfill the contract terms on its own , making it necessary for Apogee to advance cash to ensure completion of the project .
The company said its core businesses have performed well and it expects them to continue to do so in the remainder of the fiscal year .

Manhattan National Corp. said Michael A. Conway , president and chief executive officer , was elected chief executive of the holding company 's two principal insurance subsidiaries .
He succeeds Paul P. Aniskovich Jr. , who resigned to pursue other business interests , the company said .
Mr. Conway , 42 years old , was elected chairman , president and chief executive of Manhattan Life Insurance Co. and president and chief executive of Manhattan National Life Insurance Co .
Harry Rossi , 69 , chairman of the holding company , also remains chairman of Manhattan National Life Insurance Co .
Mr. Conway was executive vice president and chief investment officer of Union Central Life Insurance Co. , of Cincinnati , in 1987 , when Union Central bought a 54 % interest in Manhattan National Corp .
He resigned as an officer of Central Life to accept the Manhattan National presidency .
The Federal Trade Commission ruled that five major title-insurance companies illegally fixed prices for title search-and-examination services by participating in joint `` rating bureaus '' in six states .
The FTC ordered the companies not to use rating bureaus in those six states .
The commission order named the following companies : Ticor Title Insurance Co. of California , a unit of Los Angeles-based Ticor ; Chicago Title Insurance Co. and Safeco Title Insurance Co. , units of Chicago Title & Trust Co. ; Lawyers Title Insurance Corp. , a unit of Richmond , Va.-based Universal Corp. ; and Stewart Title Guaranty Co. , a unit of Houston-based Stewart Information Services Corp .
Chicago Title & Trust acquired Safeco in 1987 and changed the unit 's name to Security Union Title Insurance Co .
The FTC ruled that the companies violated federal antitrust law by fixing rates in the following states : New Jersey , Pennsylvania , Connecticut , Wisconsin , Arizona and Montana .
The FTC first issued an administrative complaint in the case in 1985 .
John Christie , a lawyer here for the two Chicago Title & Trust units accused the FTC of `` second-guessing '' state-level regulations , with which , he said , his clients had complied .
`` I expect all the companies to appeal , '' he added .
A lawyer for Lawyers Title said that , because the named companies no longer use the type of cooperative rating bureaus attacked by the FTC , the commission 's order wo n't have much practical impact .
Officials for the other named companies did n't return telephone calls seeking comment .
Union Carbide Corp. said third-quarter net income plunged 35 % from a year earlier on weakness in the company 's mainstay chemicals and plastics business .
Net was $ 139 million , or 98 cents
a share , for the quarter , compared with $ 213 million , or $ 1.56
a share , a year ago .
Sales were $ 2.14 billion , up 1.6 % from $ 2.11 billion
the previous year .
Carbide , like other companies with a heavy reliance on the so-called commodity end of the chemicals industry , was expected to post earnings sharply lower than in an exceptionally strong 1988 third quarter .
But the company 's latest quarter was a few pennies
a share lower than the more pessimistic projections on Wall Street .
`` It certainly was n't a disaster , but it does show weakness '' in some of the company 's chief markets , said George Krug , a chemicals-industry analyst at Oppenheimer & Co .
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading , Carbide closed at $ 24.50
a share , down 50 cents .
Prices for polyethylene , a common plastic and an important Carbide product , started to fall early this year ; the slide accelerated in the third quarter as buyers continued to trim inventories .
Prices also fell for ethylene oxide and glycols , products used in making antifreeze .
Some producers of polyethylene , figuring the inventory reductions are near an end , have announced price boosts .
The first real test of whether prices have hit bottom may come in the next several weeks , when the new prices become effective .
A Carbide spokesman said `` the conditions are right for the increase to hold .
For the third quarter , operating profit from Carbide 's chemicals and plastics business fell to $ 238 million from $ 352 million
a year ago , before accounting for taxes and interest expense .
Operating profit from carbon products , such as graphite electrodes , also declined , to $ 6 million from $ 20 million .
In the industrial-gases segment , operating profit climbed to $ 87 million from $ 58 million .
The latest quarter included a gain of about $ 62 million on the sale of the company 's urethane polyols and propylene glycols businesses .
Propylene glycols are used in making personal-care products such as shampoo , and urethane polyols are used in making the polyurethane foam found in furniture cushioning and other products .
That gain was mostly offset by a loss of about $ 55 million from a write-down in its polysilicon business .
Polysilicon is used in making integrated circuits .
For the nine months , net totaled $ 526 million , or $ 3.74
a share , up 5 % from $ 501 million , or $ 3.71
Sales rose 7.7 % to $ 6.66 billion from $ 6.19 billion .
MARK RESOURCES INC. , Calgary , Alberta , said it agreed to sell 75 million Canadian dollars ( US$ 63.9 million ) of 8 % convertible debentures to a group of securities dealers .
Mark , an oil and gas concern , said the 15-year debentures are convertible before maturity at C$ 12.50 for each Mark common share , and can be redeemed at the company 's option , under certain conditions , after Nov. 30 , 1992 .
AMERICAN BRANDS Inc. , Old Greenwich , Conn. , said it increased its quarterly 11 % to 68 cents
a share from 61 cents , payable Dec. 1 to stock of record Nov. 10 .
The increase follows the company 's report of strong earnings for the third quarter , and reflects what
American Brands called its `` tradition of sharing earnings growth '' with shareholders .
American Brands is a consumer products company with core businesses in tobacco , distilled spirits and life insurance .
As of Sept. 30 , American Brands had 95.2 million shares outstanding .
The Big Three U.S. auto makers posted losses in their core North American automotive businesses for the third quarter , and expectations of continued slow vehicle sales and price wars are casting a pall over the fourth period .
The strongest sign of the Big Three 's woes came from Ford Motor Co. , which said it had a loss in its U.S. automotive business for the first time since 1982 .
Ford predicted fourth-quarter net income will fall below the year-earlier level , partly because of a likely $ 500 million charge from the sale of its steel operations .
The bleak automotive results were offset by strong earnings from some non-automotive operations .
Still , the combined profit of Ford , Chrysler Corp. and General Motors Corp. fell 44 % to $ 1.02 billion from $ 1.83 billion
a year earlier , excluding a one-time gain of $ 309 million at Chrysler from the sale of Mitsubishi Motors Corp. stock .
The last time
all three companies reported North American automotive losses was in the recession year of 1982 .
Yesterday 's announcements helped spark a midday wave of program selling in the stock market .
GM 's common closed at $ 44.375
a share , down 50 cents , Ford fell 37.5 cents to end at $ 47.50 , and Chrysler eased 37.5 cents to $ 22.25 , all in New York Stock Exchange composite trading .
The market 's pessimism reflects the gloomy outlook in Detroit .
As Japanese auto makers gained market share , the Big Three , with GM in the lead , slashed North American production and launched a retail discounting blitz .
The price war peaked in the third quarter as Big Three factory discounts climbed to more than $ 1,000
a vehicle , according to industry officials .
GM probably had the `` heaviest incentives , '' said Robert S. Miller , Chrysler 's chief financial officer .
`` We
all did what
we had to do to stay within sight of them .
But the costly efforts did little to slow Japanese market gains , and domestic car sales have plunged 19 % since the Big Three ended many of their programs Sept. 30 .
GM , Ford and Chrysler have already cut fourth-quarter U.S. output plans an estimated 15 % from 1988 levels .
If sales do n't pick up , the cuts will go deeper and incentives will sprout again .
Ford , which has long boasted of its ability to weather a downturn , saw earnings take a beating .
The No. 2 auto maker blamed incentive costs and reduced production -- both
the result of a substantially weaker U.S. market -- for a 44 % drop in net to $ 477.1 million , or $ 1.03
a share , on revenue of $ 20.24 billion .
Nearly all the decline came in Ford 's U.S. automotive operations .
The Dearborn , Mich. , auto maker ran a loss of $ 37 million on assembling and marketing cars in the U.S. , a deterioration of $ 378 million in that line from the 1988 quarter .
Ford managed to show a profit for the quarter primarily because of earnings from overseas auto operations and financial services .
A year earlier , Ford reported record net of $ 856.3 million , or $ 1.78
a share , on revenue of $ 20.38 billion .
In the latest nine months , Ford earned $ 3.52 billion , or $ 7.51
a share , compared with $ 4.14 billion , or $ 8.53
The U.S. automotive loss was a sharp reversal for a company
that had reeled off 12 consecutive quarters of improved earnings until the 1989 second quarter .
But David N. McCammon , vice president , finance , insisted that cost-cutting and tight production capacity will make results `` better in this downturn than in prior downturns , '' when Ford had net losses .
Still , Mr. McCammon said Ford expects the U.S. economy to weaken through the end of 1990 , causing weaker sales and production .
As a result , fourth-quarter profit will come in below 1988 results , although the drop wo n't be as sharp as the 44 % third-quarter decline , he said .
Part of the drop will come from an anticipated charge of as much as $ 500 million from the proposed sale of its Rouge Steel unit .
In the 1988 fourth quarter , Ford had net of $ 1.16 billion , or $ 2.42
Chrysler 's operating profit fell to a scant $ 22 million , or 10 cents
a share , its lowest quarterly total in seven years .
Its $ 309 million , or $ 1.32
a share , gain from the sale of 75 million Mitsubishi shares made net $ 331 million , or $ 1.42
Sales were flat at $ 7.88 billion .
The results include record quarterly earnings of $ 76 million from Chrysler Financial Corp .
A year earlier , Chrysler 's net was $ 113 million , or 50 cents
Mr. Miller said costs of incentives caused a `` moderate '' loss in the Highland Park , Mich. , company 's North American car and truck business .
He said the loss was n't `` that much different '' from Ford 's $ 37 million loss on U.S. automotive operations , but he declined to be specific .
Mr. Miller said Chrysler spent an average of $ 1,000
a vehicle on its incentive programs in the third quarter , compared with about $ 450
a vehicle
a year earlier -- a `` high-water mark '' at the time .
He said Chrysler `` is no longer sure '' of its forecast for industry car and truck sales of 14.2 million in the 1990 model year .
Consumers , he said , are balking at higher prices on 1990 cars , especially after seeing the incentive-reduced prices on 1989 models .
In the nine months , net was $ 1.02 billion , or $ 4.38
a share , including the gain from the Mitsubishi stock sale , compared with $ 617 million , or $ 2.77
a share , after a charge of $ 93 million , or 42 cents
a share , for plant closings in the 1988 period .
Sales rose 8.4 % to $ 27.95 billion from $ 25.78 billion .
Heavy losses in North American auto operations sent GM 's net tumbling to $ 516.9 million from a record $ 859.2 million .
Detroit-based GM does n't issue separate quarterly earnings for the North American automotive business .
But analysts estimated that GM had a loss of as much as $ 300 million on domestic vehicle operations .
An 8.5 % drop in North American factory sales of cars and trucks cut into revenue , and rebates to dealers and customers more than offset gains from price increases on 1990 model vehicles delivered during the period , a GM spokesman said .
But GM 's results also illustrate the increasing diversity of its operations .
In one breakdown , GM attributed half of its net to its two big technology units , Electronic Data Systems Corp. and GM Hughes Electronics Corp .
Meanwhile , GM said overseas auto operations are on track to exceed last year 's record full-year net of $ 2.7 billion .
The diversified operations helped GM build its cash reserves , exclusive of its financial subsidiary , to $ 5.5 billion as of Sept. 30 , a 22 % increase from a year earlier .
This cushion could come in handy if GM has to trim fourth-quarter North American production schedules more than the already scheduled 9.5 % .
Under the circumstances , it wo n't be easy for GM to exceed its record 1988 fourth-quarter net of $ 1.4 billion , the spokesman acknowledged .
That means it 's unlikely the company will surpass last year 's $ 4.9 billion full-year profit , even though net for the first nine months was up 1.9 % to $ 3.52 billion on revenue of $ 95.57 billion .
It earned $ 3.46 billion on revenue of $ 91.21 billion in the 1988 nine months .

Mr. Vinken is chairman of Elsevier N.V. , the Dutch publishing group .
Toyota Motor Corp. predicted its annual imports will more than double by 1992 , growing by 250 % over the next three years to about 300 billion yen ( $ 2.12 billion ) as the company 's overseas manufacturing operations reach full speed .
The projected imports comprise importation to Japan and other nations of vehicles produced at the company 's major foreign manufacturing bases .
Toyota said its import program will specifically entail importing right-hand drive vehicles from its Georgetown , Ky. , U.S. plant .
`` An ultimate target of 40,000 units annually has been set for a still-to-be-named model , '' Toyota said .
Toyota will also begin importing engines produced at the Kentucky plant 's new powertrain operation .
Annual volume is expected to reach 100,000 units and will result in additional production and new employment opportunities , Toyota said .
It added that exports of U.S.-made Camrys to Taiwan will rise to 10,000
a year by 1992 from a 1989 level of 4,000 units .
Toyota also announced a number of major overseas purchases .
They include plans to buy 200 vehicles from U.S. and European auto makers for Toyota 's Rent-A-Lease division in Japan and plans to purchase a Cray Y-MP8-232 supercomputer .
Lloyd 's of London said it plans to clamp down on the ability of underwriting syndicates to leave their annual accounts open beyond the customary three years .
Underwriting syndicates at Lloyd 's , the world 's largest insurance market , generally do n't close their accounts for three years , to allow for the filing of claims and litigation .
When such claims and litigation extend beyond the period , the syndicates can extend their accounting deadlines .
Lloyd 's said there are currently 115 open account years involving 68 of the market 's roughly 360 syndicates .
The open-year accounting practice `` is widely recognized within Lloyd 's as of serious concern '' to the 31,329 member investors , who underwrite insurance at Lloyd 's in return for premium and investment income , Lloyd 's said .
The procedure causes `` great uncertainty '' because an investor ca n't be sure of his or her individual liability , Lloyd 's said .
As a result , the insurance market plans new measures to restrict the ability of syndicate officials to leave years open .
Lloyd 's said it expects to enact new rules mandating the changes by year end .
Under the new rules , the officials will have to secure additional information and reports from actuaries , including an assessment of whether officials have acted reasonably .
In addition , officials will have to get quotes for certain reinsurance contracts and obtain approvals from other syndicate directors .
Poughkeepsie Savings Bank said a plan to sell its South Carolina branch offices to First Citizens Bank , of Columbia , S.C. , fell through .
Poughkeepsie also expects to post a one-time charge of $ 8.3 million , resulting in a net loss for the third quarter .
The charge represents a write-down of the goodwill associated with Poughkeepsie 's investment in the banks
it is trying to sell and its North Carolina branches as well .
The thrift announced the plan Aug. 21 .
Among other reasons , high fees regulators imposed on certain transfers of thrift deposits to commercial banks `` substantially altered the economics of the transaction for both
parties , '' Poughkeepsie said .
Additionally , the bank is increasing its loan-loss reserves for the third quarter by $ 8.5 million before taxes .
In the year-earlier third quarter , Poughkeepsie Savings had net income of $ 2.8 million , or 77 cents
Poughkeepsie said it is continuing to try to sell itself , under a June agreement with a dissident-shareholder group .
The bank also said its effort would continue past the Nov. 1 deadline set in that agreement and that the litigation between the two sides might resume as a result .
The thrift and the holders had suspended their lawsuits as part of the agreement .
China 's slide toward recession is beginning to look like a free fall .
In a report on China 's foundering economy , the official State Statistical Bureau disclosed that industrial output last month rose 0.9 % from a year earlier - the lowest growth rate in a decade for September .
Retail sales are plummeting , while consumer prices still are rising .
Chinese and foreign economists now predict prolonged stagflation : low growth and high inflation .
`` The economy is crashing hard , '' says an Asian economist in Beijing .
`` The slowdown is taking hold a lot more quickly and devastatingly than anyone had expected .
A lengthy recession , if it materializes , would drain state coffers and create severe hardships for urban workers .
Experts predict the coming year will be characterized by flat or negative industrial growth , rising unemployment and a widening budget deficit .
Unless the government suddenly reverses course , wages for most workers wo n't keep pace with inflation , creating a potential source of urban unrest .
The economy 's slowdown is due only partly to the austerity program launched in September 1988 to cool an overheated economy and tame inflation .
( Industrial output surged 21 % in 1988 , while inflation peaked last February at nearly 30 % .
) The slowdown also results from chronic energy and raw-materials shortages
that force many factories to restrict operations to two or three days
In Western , market-driven countries , recessions often have a bright side : prodding the economy to greater efficiency .
In China , however , there is n't likely to be any silver lining because the economy remains guided primarily by the state .
Instead , China is likely to shell out ever-greater subsidies to its coddled state-run enterprises , which ate up $ 18 billion in bailouts last year .
Nor are any of these inefficient monoliths likely to be allowed to go bankrupt .
Rather , the brunt of the slowdown will be felt in the fast-growing private and semi-private `` township '' enterprises , which have fallen into disfavor as China 's leaders re-emphasize an orthodox Marxist preference for public ownership .
`` When the going gets rough , China penalizes the efficient and rewards the incompetent , '' says a Western economist .
Reports of an economy near recession come as officials prepare a major Communist Party plenum for sometime in the next few weeks .
The meeting is expected to call for heightened austerity for two years .
But with industrial growth stagnant and inflation showing signs of easing , some voices may call for measures to pump new life into the economy .
Some analysts believe China soon will begin relaxing economic controls , particularly by loosening credit .
That would benefit Chinese enterprises as well as Sino-foreign joint ventures , both of which have been plagued by shortages of working capital .
A dangerous buildup
this year of billions of dollars in inter-company debts threatens , if unchecked , to bring the economy to a collapse .
One sign of a possible easing of credit policy was the decision
this week of People 's Bank of China , the central bank , to allocate $ 5.4 billion in short-term loans to pay farmers for the autumn harvest , the official China Daily reported .
But while pumping more money into the economy would bring relief to many industries , it also runs the risk of triggering another period of runaway growth and steep inflation .
The cycle has been repeated several times since China began reforming its planned economy in 1979 .
And , because China 's leaders have abandoned plans to drastically reform the economy , it is likely to continue , analysts say .
The statistical bureau 's report , cited in China Daily , notes that industrial output in September totaled $ 29.4 billion , a rise of just 0.9 % from a year earlier .
Output declined in several provinces , including Jiangsu and Zhejiang , two key coastal areas , and Sichuan , the nation 's agricultural breadbasket .
Production in Shanghai , China 's industrial powerhouse and the largest source of tax revenue for the central government , fell 1.8 % for the month .
Nationwide , output of light industrial products declined 1.8 % -- `` the first decline in 10 years , '' a bureau spokesman told China Daily .
In an unusually direct statement , the bureau spokesman recommended that state banks extend more credit to shopkeepers so that they can purchase manufacturers ' goods .
`` This will prevent a slide in industrial production , which will otherwise cause new panic buyings , '' the spokesman said .
Bob Evans Inc. said its board authorized the purchase of as many as 500,000 shares of its common .

Health-care companies should get healthier in the third quarter .
Medical-supply houses are expected to report earnings increases of about 15 % on average for the third quarter , despite sales increases of less than 10 % , analysts say .
To offset sluggish sales growth , companies have been cutting staff , mostly through attrition , and slowing the growth in research and development spending .
Sales growth in the quarter was slowed by mounting pressure from groups of buyers , such as hospitals , to hold down prices .
Suppliers were also hurt by the stronger U.S. dollar , which makes sales abroad more difficult .
In some cases , competition has squeezed margins .
Becton , Dickinson & Co. , for example , faces stiff competition from a Japanese supplier in the important syringe market .
The Franklin Lakes , N.J. , company is expected to report sales growth of only 5 % to 6 % , but should still maintain earnings growth of 10 % , says Jerry E. Fuller , an analyst with Duff & Phelps Inc .
Among the first of the group to post results , Abbott Laboratories said third-quarter net income jumped 14 % to $ 196 million , or 88 cents
a share , from $ 172 million , or 76 cents
Sales for the company , based in Abbott Park , Ill. , rose 8.3 % to $ 1.31 billion from $ 1.21 billion .
Baxter International Inc. yesterday reported net climbed 20 % in the third period to $ 102 million , or 34 cents
a share , from $ 85 million , or 28 cents
Sales for the Deerfield , Ill. , company rose 5.8 % to $ 1.81 billion from $ 1.71 billion .
But not every company expects to report increased earnings .
C.R. Bard Inc. yesterday said third-quarter net plunged 51 % to $ 9.9 million , or 18 cents
a share , from $ 20 million , or 35 cents
Sales fell 1.2 % to $ 190.1 million from $ 192.5 million .
The Murray Hill , N.J. , company said full-year earnings may be off 33 cents
a share because the company removed a catheter from the market .
In 1988 , the company earned $ 1.38
The Food and Drug Administration had raised questions about the device 's design .
Some analysts add that third-party pressures to reduce health costs will continue to bedevil companies ' bottom lines .
Takeover speculation , which has been buoying stocks of supply houses , may also ease , says Peter Sidoti , an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc .
`` As that wanes , you 're going to see the stocks probably wane as well , '' he says .
Hospitals companies , meanwhile , are reporting improved earnings .
Bolstered by strong performances by its psychiatric hospitals , National Medical Enterprises Inc. , Los Angeles , reported net income of $ 50 million , or 65 cents
a share , for the first quarter ended Aug. 31 , up from $ 41 million , or 56 cents
Humana Inc. , Louisville , Ky. , also reported favorable results , with net income of $ 66.7 million , or 66 cents , in the fourth quarter ended Aug. 31 , up from $ 58.2 million , or 59 cents , a year earlier .
Analysts say the handful of hospital companies
that are still publicly traded are benefiting from several trends .
Most important , hospital admission rates are stabilizing after several years of decline .
Moreover , companies have sold off many of their smaller , less-profitable hospitals and have completed painful restructurings .
Humana 's revenues , for example , are being boosted by large increases in enrollments in the company 's health maintenance organizations .
Says Todd Richter , an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds : `` The shakeout in the publicly traded companies is over .
Northwest Airlines settled the remaining lawsuits filed on behalf of 156 people killed in a 1987 crash , but claims against the jetliner 's maker are being pursued , a federal judge said .
Northwest , a unit of NWA Inc. , and McDonnell Douglas Corp. , which made the MD-80 aircraft , also are pursuing counterclaims against each other in the crash near Detroit Metropolitan Airport .
Terms of the settlements for the remaining 145 lawsuits against Northwest were n't disclosed .
A total of 157 lawsuits were filed on behalf of crash victims .
U.S. District Judge Julian A. Cook Jr. announced the settlements as the jury trial was to begin yesterday .
He reset opening arguments for today .
The jury will resolve the claims against McDonnell Douglas , Northwest 's claim that a defect in the aircraft caused the crash , and McDonnell Douglas ' claim that the plane was improperly flown .
The National Transportation Safety Board ruled that pilots failed to set the plane 's wing flaps and slats properly for takeoff and failed to make mandatory preflight checks
that would have detected the error .
Also , a cockpit warning system failed to alert the pilots
the flaps and slats were not set for takeoff , the NTSB said .
The only passenger
who survived the crash was Cecelia Cichan , then 4 , of Tempe , Ariz. , whose parents and brother died in the crash .
She now lives with relatives in Alabama .
When the Trinity Repertory Theater named Anne Bogart its artistic director last spring , the nation 's theatrical cognoscenti arched a collective eyebrow .
Ms. Bogart , an acclaimed creator of deconstructed dramatic collages
that tear into such sacred texts as Rodgers and Hammerstein 's `` South Pacific , '' is decidedly downtown .
Trinity Rep meanwhile is one of the nation 's oldest and most respected regional theaters , still hosting an annual `` A Christmas Carol .
How would this bastion of traditional values fare in Ms. Bogart 's iconoclastic hands ?
She held her fire with her first production at the Trinity earlier this season .
It was a predictable revival of her prize-winning off-Broadway anthology of Bertolt Brecht 's theoretical writings , called `` No Plays , No Poetry .
Now , with the opening of Maxim Gorky 's bourgeois-bashing `` Summerfolk , '' Ms. Bogart has laid her cards on the table .
Hers is a hand
that will test the mettle of her audiences .
For Ms. Bogart , who initially studied and directed in Germany ( and cites such European directors as Peter Stein , Giorgio Strehler and Ariane Mnouchkine as influences ) tends to stage her productions with a Brechtian rigor -- whether the text demands it or not .
And Gorky , considered the father of Soviet socialist realism , did not write plays
that easily lend themselves to deliberately antirealistic distancing techniques .
Gorky was a loyal if occasionally ambivalent proletarian writer committed to enlightening the masses with plain speaking rooted in a slightly sour version of Chekhovian humanism .
And `` Summerfolk , '' penned in 1904 as a kind of sequel to Chekhov 's `` Cherry Orchard , '' is a lawn party of Russian yuppies engaged in an exhausting ideological fight to the finish between the allrightniks and the reformers .
Along the way
there also are lots of romantic dalliances .
Wisely Ms. Bogart has kept Gorky 's time and place intact .
Despite the absence of samovars ( and a tendency to turn the furniture upside down ) , the production is rich in Russian ennui voiced by languorous folk sporting beige linen and rumpled cotton , with boaters and fishing poles aplenty .
But beyond this decorative nod to tradition , Ms. Bogart and company head off in a stylistic direction that all but transforms Gorky 's naturalistic drama into something akin to , well , farce .
The director 's attempt to force some Brechtian distance between her actors and their characters frequently backfires with performances
that are unduly mannered .
Not only do the actors stand outside their characters and make it clear they are at odds with them , but they often literally stand on their heads .
Like Peter Sellars , Ms. Bogart manipulates her actors as if they were rag dolls , sprawling them on staircases , dangling them off tables , even hanging them from precipices while having them perform some gymnastic feats of derring-do .
There are moments in this `` Summerfolk '' when the characters populating the vast multilevel country house ( which looks like a parody of Frank Lloyd Wright and is designed by Victoria Petrovich ) spout philosophic bon mots with the self-conscious rat-a-tat-tat pacing of `` Laugh In .
'' `` Talk hurts from where it spurts , '' one of them says .
The clash of ideologies survives this treatment , but the nuance and richness of Gorky 's individual characters have vanished in the scuffle .
As for the humor that Gorky 's text provides , when repainted in such broad strokes ( particularly by the lesser members of the ensemble ) it looks and sounds forced .
Ms. Bogart does better with music than with words when she wants , as she so often does want , to express herself through Gorky 's helpless play .
Here she has the aid of her longtime associate Jeff Helpern , whom
she appointed Trinity 's first-ever musical director and whom
she equipped with a spanking new $ 60,000 sound system and recording studio .
For Gorky , Mr. Helpern provided an aural collage of Debussy and Rachmaninoff , which is less a score than a separate character with a distinct point of view .
Like Brecht , and indeed Ezra Pound , Ms. Bogart has said that her intent in such manipulative staging of the classics is simply an attempt to `` make it new .
'' Indeed , during a recent post-production audience discussion , the director explained that her fondest artistic wish was to find a way to play `` Somewhere Over the Rainbow '' so that the song 's `` original beauty comes through , '' surmounting the cliche .
The danger that Ms. Bogart seems to be courting here is one of obfuscation rather than rejuvenation , a vision so at odds with the playwright 's that the two points of view nullify , rather than illuminate , each other .
Ms. Bogart 's cast is part and parcel of the problem .
Ed Shea and Barbara Orson never find a real reason for their love affair as the foolish , idealistic young Vass and the tirelessly humanitarian doctor Maria Lvovna .
Cynthia Strickland as the long-suffering Varvara is a tiresome whiner , not the inspirational counterrevolutionary Gorky intended .
Better to look in the corners for performances
that inspire or amuse .
Janice Duclos , in addition to possessing one of the evening 's more impressive vocal instruments , brings an unsuspected comedic touch to her role of Olga , everybody
's favorite mom .
Marni Rice plays the maid with so much edge as to steal her
two scenes .
But it is the Trinity Rep newcomer , Jonathan Fried ( Zamislov , the paralegal ) who is the actor to watch , whether he is hamming it up while conducting the chamber musicians or seducing his neighbor 's wife ( Becca Lish ) by licking her bosom .
Ms. de Vries writes frequently about theater .
Boeing Co. said it is discussing plans with three of its regular Japanese suppliers to possibly help build a larger version of its popular 767 twin-jet .
The discussions are still in preliminary stages , and the specific details have n't been worked out between the Seattle aerospace company and Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd. , Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. and Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd .
The three Japanese companies build the body sections of the 767 , accounting for a combined 15 % of the aircraft .
Japanese press reports have speculated that the Japanese contribution could rise to between 20 % and 25 % under the new program .
If Boeing goes ahead with the larger 767 , the plane could hit the market in the mid-1990s .
Honeywell Inc. , Minneapolis , said it completed its previously announced sale of 16 % of the shares outstanding in its Japanese joint venture , Yamatake-Honeywell , for $ 280 million .
The stake was acquired by a group of 10 Japanese financial institutions and industrial corporations , primarily insurance companies , Honeywell said .
Proceeds will be used to repurchase as many as 10 million shares of Honeywell stock , as previously announced .
Honeywell said a second sale of Yamatake-Honeywell is still being negotiated .
The company , which now holds a 34 % stake in the venture , has indicated that it intends to retain at least a 20 % stake long term .
A 20 % stake would allow Honeywell to include Yamatake earnings in its results .
A company spokesman said the gain on the sale could n't be estimated until the `` tax treatment has been determined .

Philips said third-quarter net profit surged 41 % to 227 million guilders ( $ 109.4 million ) , or 84 guilder cents
a share , from 161 million guilders , or 63 cents , a year earlier .
Separately , the Dutch electronics group announced it will spin off about 20 % of its PolyGram BV recording subsidiary in an international stock offering .
It said it plans to file the share offer with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and Amsterdam Stock Exchange `` within the next few weeks .
'' It did n't elaborate .
The big earnings improvement reflected extraordinary gains and the accounting impact of subsidiary disposals , as well as restructuring charges , mixed market factors , higher taxes and plunging financing costs and other spending reductions .
The 1989 third-quarter 's jump in net profit was aided by a 277 million guilder , or 47.4 % , drop in net financing charges .
Disappointments in the quarter included intense competition causing downward price pressure
that led to unspecified operating losses in two key product lines , especially in the U.S .
As a result , Philips 's pretax operating profit before financing items tumbled 15.7 % from a year earlier to 592 million guilders .
Third-quarter sales world-wide were unchanged from a year ago at 13.57 billion guilders .
Westmoreland Coal Co. , realizing benefits of a sustained effort to cut costs and boost productivity , reported sharply improved third-quarter results .
The producer and marketer of low-sulfur coal said net income for the quarter was $ 5.9 million , or 71 cents
a share , on revenue of $ 145.4 million .
For the year-earlier period , the company reported a loss of $ 520,000 or six cents
In the latest nine months , the company earned $ 8.5 million , or $ 1.03
Last year 's net loss of $ 3,524,000 included a benefit of $ 1,640,000 from an accounting change .
Revenue for the nine months rose to $ 449 million from $ 441.1 million .
In an interview , Pemberton Hutchinson , president and chief executive , cited several reasons for the improvement : higher employee productivity and `` good natural conditions '' in the mines , as well as lower costs for materials , administrative overhead and debt interest .
In the latest nine months , Mr. Hutchinson said , total coal sales rose to about 14.6 million tons from about 14.3 million tons
In addition , long-term debt has been trimmed to about $ 72 million from $ 96 million since Jan. 1 .
He predicted the debt ratio will improve further in coming quarters .
Westmoreland 's strategy is to retain and expand its core business of mining and selling low-sulphur coal in the Appalachia region .
The operating territory includes coal terminals on the Ohio River and in Newport News , Va .
Westmoreland exports about a fourth of its coal tonnage , including a significant amount of metallurgical coal produced by others
that is used by steelmakers overseas .
For the past couple of years , Westmoreland has undertaken an aggressive streamlining of all aspects of its business .
Marginal operations and assets have been sold .
The size of the company 's board has been reduced to eight directors from 13 .
About 140 salaried management jobs and hundreds of hourly wage positions have been eliminated .
Even perks have been reduced .
For example , the chief executive
himself now pays 20 % of the cost of his health benefits ; the company used to pay 100 % .
`` I think the ship is now righted , the bilges are pumped and we are on course , '' Mr. Hutchinson said of the restructuring program .
`` Much of what
we set out to do is completed .
But he cautioned that Westmoreland 's third quarter is typically better than the fourth , so investors `` should n't just multiply the third quarter by four '' and assume the same rate of improvement can be sustained .
One difference , he said , is that the fourth quarter has significantly fewer workdays because of holidays and the hunting season .
`` I do n't want to give the impression that everybody can relax now , '' he said .
`` We have to keep working at improving our core business to stay efficient .
It 's a process that never really ends .
Nevertheless , Mr. Hutchinson predicted that 1989 would be `` solidly profitable '' for Westmoreland and that 1990 would bring `` more of the same .
'' For all of 1988 , the company reported an after-tax operating loss of $ 134,000 on revenue of $ 593.5 million .
An accounting adjustment made net income $ 1.5 million , or 18 cents
In a move
that complements the company 's basic strategy , its Westmoreland Energy Inc. unit is developing four coal-fired cogeneration plants with a partner in Virginia .
Some of the coal
the plants buy will come from Westmoreland mines .
Mr. Hutchinson predicted that the unit 's contribution to company results in the 1990s `` will be exciting .
'' He said Westmoreland is looking at investment stakes in other cogeneration plants east of the Mississippi River .
Westmoreland expects energy demand to grow annually in the 2.5 % range in the early 1990s .
`` We see coal 's piece of the action growing , '' Mr. Hutchinson said .
`` Coal prices , while not skyrocketing , will grow modestly in real terms , we think .
In an age of specialization , the federal judiciary is one of the last bastions of the generalist .
A judge must jump from murder to antitrust cases , from arson to securities fraud , without missing a beat .
But even on the federal bench , specialization is creeping in , and it has become a subject of sharp controversy on the newest federal appeals court .
The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit was created in 1982 to serve , among other things , as the court of last resort for most patent disputes .
Previously , patent cases moved through the court system to one of the 12 circuit appeals courts .
There , judges
who saw few such cases and had no experience in the field grappled with some of the most technical and complex disputes imaginable .
A new specialty court was sought by patent experts , who believed that the generalists had botched too many important , multimillion-dollar cases .
Some patent lawyers had hoped that such a specialty court would be filled with experts in the field .
But the Reagan administration thought otherwise , and so may the Bush administration .
Since 1984 , the president has filled four vacancies in the Federal Circuit court with non-patent lawyers .
Now only three of the 12 judges -- Pauline Newman , Chief Judge Howard T. Markey , 68 , and Giles Rich , 85 -- have patent-law backgrounds .
The latter two and Judge Daniel M. Friedman , 73 , are approaching senior status or retirement .
Three seats currently are vacant and three others are likely to be filled within a few years , so patent lawyers and research-based industries are making a new push for specialists to be added to the court .
Several organizations , including the Industrial Biotechnical Association and the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association , have asked the White House and Justice Department to name candidates with both patent and scientific backgrounds .
The associations would like the court to include between three and six judges with specialized training .
Some of the associations have recommended Dr. Alan D. Lourie , 54 , a former patent agent with a doctorate in organic chemistry
who now is associate general counsel with SmithKline Beckman Corp. in Philadelphia .
Dr. Lourie says the Justice Department interviewed him last July .
Their effort has received a lukewarm response from the Justice Department .
`` We do not feel that seats are reserved ( for patent lawyers ) , '' says Justice spokesman David Runkel , who declines to say how soon a candidate will be named .
`` But we will take it into consideration .
The Justice Department 's view is shared by other lawyers and at least one member of the court , Judge H. Robert Mayer , a former civil litigator
who served at the claims court trial level before he was appointed to the Federal Circuit two years ago .
`` I believe that any good lawyer should be able to figure out and understand patent law , '' Judge Mayer says , adding that `` it 's the responsibility of highly paid lawyers ( who argue before the court ) to make us understand ( complex patent litigation ) .
Yet some lawyers point to Eli Lilly & Co. vs. Medtronic , Inc. , the patent infringement case
the Supreme Court
this month agreed to review , as an example of poor legal reasoning by judges
who lack patent litigation experience .
( Judge Mayer was not on the three-member panel .
In the Lilly case , the appeals court broadly construed a federal statute to grant Medtronic , a medical device manufacturer , an exemption to infringe a patent under certain circumstances .
If the Supreme Court holds in Medtronic 's favor , the decision will have billion-dollar consequences for the manufacturers of medical devices , color and food additives and all other non-drug products
that required Food & Drug Administration approval .
Lisa Raines , a lawyer and director of government relations for the Industrial Biotechnical Association , contends that a judge well-versed in patent law and the concerns of research-based industries would have ruled otherwise .
And Judge Newman , a former patent lawyer , wrote in her dissent when the court denied a motion for a rehearing of the case by the full court , `` The panel 's judicial legislation has affected an important high-technological industry , without regard to the consequences for research and innovation or the public interest .
Says Ms. Raines , ``
( The judgment ) confirms our concern that the absence of patent lawyers on the court could prove troublesome .
Democracy is making a return with a vengeance to Latin America 's most populous and deeply indebted country .
On Nov. 15 , when Brazilians elect a president for the first time in 29 years , the country 's 82 million voters will have 22 candidates to choose from .
The candidates have been crisscrossing this huge country of 145 million people , holding rallies and televised debates in hope of being elected to what must be one of the world 's most thankless political jobs : trying to drag Brazil out of its economic and social mess .
`` I feel sorry for whoever wins , '' says a Brazilian diplomat .
Who
that winner will be is highly uncertain .
A half-dozen candidates , backing policies ranging from Thatcherism to watered-down Marxism , are given a chance of winning .
`` Whoever says he knows which of the six will win is out of his mind , '' says Antonio Britto , a centrist member of Parliament .
The favorite remains Fernando Collor de Mello , a 40-year-old former governor of the state of Alagoas .
He came out of nowhere to grab the lead in opinion polls , probably less because of his vague program to `` build a new Brazil '' than because of his good looks , the open backing of the powerful Rede Globo television network and his reputation as a hunter of `` maharajahs , '' or overpaid and underworked civil servants .
But after building up a commanding lead , the moderate to conservative Mr. Collor has slipped to about 30 % in the polls from a high of about 43 % only a few weeks ago .
To avoid a runoff , one candidate would have to win 50 % of the vote -- a feat that most analysts consider impossible with so many candidates running .
Two left-wing politicians , Socialist Leonel Brizola , a former governor of Rio de Janeiro state , and Marxist-leaning Luis Inacio da Silva , currently are running neck and neck at about 15 % , and three other candidates are given a chance of reaching the Dec. 17 runoff election between the two biggest vote-getters : Social Democrat Mario Covas and two conservatives , Paulo Salim Maluf , a former governor of the state of Sao Paulo , and Guilherme Afif Domingos .
The uncertainty is sending shivers through Brazilian financial markets .
The dollar , the best indicator of the country 's mood , has skyrocketed on the parallel market , as has gold .
Capital flight is reported to be strong .
The big question is whether the new president will have the strength and the political support in Congress to take steps to cure Brazil 's economic ills .
President Jose Sarney , who took office in 1985 when the man picked by an electoral college became critically ill , appears to be simply trying to avoid hyperinflation .
The unpopular Mr. Sarney , whose task was to bring about a smooth transition to democracy after 21 years of military rule , is n't seeking re-election .
What comes out of the ballot box could be crucial in determining whether Brazil finally lives up to the potential of the world 's eighth largest economy or keeps living up to its other , less enviable title : that of the developing world 's largest debtor , teetering on the brink of hyperinflation , mired in deficits and stagnation , with huge economic inequalities and social discontent boiling under the surface .
If Brazil devises
an economic strategy allowing it to resume growth and service debt , this could lead it to open up and deregulate its sheltered economy , analysts say , just as Argentinian President Carlos Saul Menem has been doing even though he was elected on a populist platform .
`` Depending on the president , we could either be a trillion-dollar economy by the end of the century or stay where we are , '' says political scientist Amaury de Souza .
`` And where we are is bad .
Despite valiant efforts by Finance Minister Mailson Ferreira da Nobrega , inflation came to 36 % in September alone and is expected to top 1,000 % for the year .
That might have been considered hyperinflation not long ago , but Argentina endured price increases of almost 200 % in July before bringing the rate down sharply in August and September .
Still , massive internal debt has forced the government to borrow massively on the domestic market and to offer inflation-adjusted returns of 2 % to 3 %
a month just to get investors to hold on to its paper .
About $ 70 billion is estimated to be tied up in the short-term money market , which acts both as a hedge against inflation for consumers and an accelerator of inflation and deficits for the government .
By some estimates , Brazil 's internal debt , or combined public deficit , could reach 6.5 % of its $ 351 billion gross domestic product .
Much of the money goes into subsidies or keeping inefficient state-controlled companies operating .
Among the results is a frequent breakdown of public services .
It 's not uncommon to wait three minutes for a dial tone after picking up the telephone , and then to be interrupted by a busy signal before finishing dialing the number .
Officials also say a national electricity shortage might not be far off .
Economists , businessmen and some politicians agree that the answer is an orthodox economic austerity program including reduced state spending ; focusing spending on vital areas such as education , health and welfare ; turning state companies private ; reforming the tax system , raising public service rates to match costs ; and possibly a temporary wage and price freeze and a devaluation of the cruzado .
Analysts also say it 's inevitable that Brazil will seek to renegotiate its $ 115 billion foreign debt , on which
it suspended interest payments last month .
Analysts say , however , that a tough economic program would have to be accompanied by measures to shield the poor from its recessionary effects , for instance by subsidizing staple food items .
About 80 % of Brazil 's voters are believed to live near the poverty level .
Of the three candidates with a serious chance of winning , Mr. Collor comes closest to advocating the sort of measures that economists say are necessary .
But his inexperience raises doubts that he would have the political power to carry them out .
The 67-year-old Mr. Brizola has been vague about his intentions and often inflammatory in his rhetoric , but analysts say he probably would be pragmatic .
Mr. da Silva , a 43-year-old former factory worker and labor leader , is the most radical , vowing to withhold payments on the foreign debt and saying he `` would n't go around putting the country up for sale to the highest bidder .
'' But despite the differences in what
they say , according to some analysts here , economic constraints mean the next president may not have many choices about what
he does .
Margaret Thatcher 's instinctive response to the latest upheaval in her government is to promise business as usual .
That may be the last thing
she needs .
As the air clears from last week 's storm of resignations and reshufflings , the government faces a daunting job of rebuilding confidence in its policies .
The prime minister and her new chancellor of the exchequer , the untested John Major , need to haul the country through something like a recession to bring down inflation and set the economy moving again .
Mrs. Thatcher has to come to terms with European economic integration , beginning with the European Monetary System , which
Britain is committed to joining fully someday .
Finally , the government has to convince a rattled financial community -- and voters -- it is proceeding coherently toward its goals .
It sounds like the work of a decade , but the deadline is late 1991 , when Mrs. Thatcher is expected to call another national election .
What 's worrying her supporters is that the economic cycle may be out of kilter with the political timetable .
She could end up seeking a fourth term in an economy sick with inflation , high interest rates and a heavy trade deficit .
Though Mrs. Thatcher has pulled through other crises , supporters wonder if her steely , autocratic ways are the right formula today .
`` There 's a rising fear that perhaps Mrs. Thatcher 's style of management has become a political liability , '' says Bill Martin , senior economist at London brokers UBS-Phillips & Drew .
The prime minister 's insistence on keeping a private coterie of advisers -- including an economic guru
who openly criticized former Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson -- confused the financial community .
Last week , the strategy of playing the two experts off each other blew up : Mr. Lawson quit in exasperation and Sir Alan Walters , the adviser , announced his resignation within an hour .
The confusion could be costly .
Currency traders , suspecting Mr. Major wo n't defend the pound strenuously , sent the British currency sharply lower Friday against the dollar and West German mark .
Analysts expect further jitters
A continuing slide in the pound could force the government to push through another rise in the base rate , currently 15 % .
That could shove a weak economy into recession .
Economists have been anticipating a slump for months , but they now say it will be deeper and longer than they had thought .
Britain 's economy `` is developing rapidly toward no-growth , '' says J. Paul Horne , international economist with Smith Barney , Harris Upham Co. in Paris .
A mild slowdown probably would have run its course by early 1991 , economists say , while the grueling downturn now expected could stretch into 1992 .
Recovery could be hampered if Britain 's major trading partners in Europe , which are enjoying robust economic activity , cool off as expected in late 1990 and 1991 .
That would leave Mrs. Thatcher little room for maneuver .
For the Tories to win the next election , voters will need to sense economic improvement for about a year beforehand .
Though Mrs. Thatcher does n't need to call an election until June 1992 , she would prefer doing so in late 1991 .
`` If the economy shows no sign of turning around in about year 's time , she will be very vulnerable , '' says John Barnes , a lecturer at the London School of Economics .
There 's an equally pressing deadline for the government to define its monetary and economic ties to the rest of the European Community .
It has sent mixed signals about its willingness to take part in the exchange-rate mechanism of the European Monetary System , which links the major EC currencies .
At a June EC summit , Mrs. Thatcher appeared to ease her opposition to full EMS membership , saying Britain would join once its inflation rate fell and the EC liberalized capital movements .
Since then , the government has left observers wondering if it ever meant to join .
Sir Alan assailed the monetary arrangement as `` half-baked '' in an article being published in an American economics journal .
That produced little reaction from his boss , reinforcing speculation
the government would use its two conditions as a pretext for avoiding full EMS membership .
Despite the departure of Mr. Lawson and Sir Alan , the tug-of-war over the EMS could continue .
Sir Geoffrey Howe , deputy prime minister and a Lawson ally on the EMS , has signaled he will continue pressing for early membership .
Of immediate concern is whether the Thatcher government will continue Mr. Lawson 's policy of tracking the monetary policies of the West German Bundesbank and responding in kind when the Frankfurt authorities move interest rates .
Mrs. Thatcher `` does n't like taking orders from foreigners , '' says Tim Congdon , economist with Gerrard & National Holding PLC .
As Conservatives rally around Mrs. Thatcher during the crisis , many harbor hopes last week 's debacle will prompt change .
`` We wo n't have any more of this wayward behavior , '' says Sir Peter Hordern , a backbench Tory member of Parliament .
`` The party is fed up with sackings of good people .
It 's an unrealistic expectation .
As long as a decade ago , Mrs. Thatcher declared she did n't want debate in her cabinet ; she wanted strong government .
Over the weekend , she said she did n't intend to change her style and denied she is authoritarian .
`` Nonsense , '' she told an interviewer yesterday on London Weekend Television .
`` I am staying my own sweet , reasonable self .
In an Oct. 10 editorial-page article , `` It 's the World Bank 's Turn to Adjust , '' Paul Craig Roberts lays most of the blame for what ails developing countries at the doorstep of the World Bank .
The article is , unfortunately , replete with outrageous distortions .
One of Mr. Roberts 's observations is that the Bank 's own loan portfolio is in deep trouble because of its lending to developing countries .
This is just not so .
The reality is that Bank finances are rock solid .
As of June 30 , 1989 -- the day our past fiscal year came to a close -- only 4.1 % of the Bank 's portfolio was affected by arrears of over six months .
This is an enviably low level .
Moreover , the Bank follows a prudent provisioning policy and has set aside $ 800 million against possible loan losses .
For the same fiscal year , by the way , the Bank 's net income was a robust $ 1.1 billion after provisions .
Because of the business-like manner in which
the Bank goes about development , financial markets have confidence in it .
This helps explain the triple-A rating enjoyed by our bonds and our ability to borrow $ 9.3 billion in fiscal 1989 on the most advantageous terms .
Another of Mr. Roberts 's criticisms is that Bank lending has done more harm than good `` by implanting the wrong incentives and deflecting energy away from economic development .
'' Here , too , Mr. Roberts is way off the mark .
The reality is that Bank loans have been linked to policy improvements for 40 years .
Our traditional project loans have , for instance , supported sensible energy pricing in the power sector , sound interest-rate policies in the credit area and the operation of public utilities as efficient , autonomous agencies .
By and large , these efforts have borne fruit .
In my home region , Latin America , much of the existing infrastructure base -- an important building block for development -- has been financed by the World Bank .
Mr. Roberts also takes a swipe at the Bank 's adjustment lending .
What are the facts on this type of lending ?
The Bank has been making adjustment loans for 10 years .
As their name implies , these operations are linked to far-reaching policy reforms
that aim at helping borrowing countries get back on the growth path and at enhancing their credit-worthiness .
Typically , these measures include reforms to downsize the role of government and parastatals in the economy , to open up inward-looking economies to international competition and to promote the development of a vigorous private sector .
Support for the private sector has been a longstanding concern of the Bank 's .
Over the years , it has helped encourage investments by entrepreneurs in the Third World through its extensive credit operations and through loans and investments by the International Finance Corp .
Most recently , the Bank Group has been expanded to include the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency to stimulate direct foreign investment in developing countries by offering guarantees against noncommercial risk and advice to member countries on how to improve their business climate .
These are not the actions of a development agency wed to central planning and to the concentration of investment decisions in the hands of government , as Mr. Roberts alleges .
Rather , they reflect the Bank 's time-tested , pragmatic approach , which aims at ensuring that developing countries put their scarce resources to the best possible use .

With reduced exports and rising imports , South Korea 's trade surpluses with the U.S. and Europe between January and September fell sharply from a year ago , the Customs Administration said .
Officials said South Korea 's trade surplus with the U.S. for the first nine months of the year totaled $ 3.49 billion , down 43 % from the same period last year on a customs-clearance basis .
South Korean exports to the U.S. during the period fell 1.6 % from a year ago to $ 15.06 billion , while imports from the U.S. soared 26 % to $ 11.56 billion .
The trade surplus with Europe was pegged at $ 414 million , down 57 % from a year ago .
Officials said South Korean exports to Europe dropped 5.3 % to $ 3.02 billion while imports from there went up 17 % to $ 2.61 billion .
When the Supreme Soviet passed laws on workers ' rights in May 1987 and on self-managing cooperatives
a year later , some Western observers assumed Mikhail Gorbachev had launched the Soviet Union on a course
that would lead inevitably to the creation of a market economy .
Their only doubt concerned the possibility that Mr. Gorbachev might not survive the opposition that his reforms would arouse and that the whole process might be reversed .
If Mr. Gorbachev 's goal is the creation of a free market , he and these Western observers have good reason to fear for his future , as economic liberalization within communist societies leads inexorably to demands for fundamental political reform accompanied by civil unrest .
These fears were clearly apparent when , last week , Secretary of State James Baker blocked a speech by Robert Gates , deputy national security adviser and Soviet expert , on the ground that it was too pessimistic about the chances of Mr. Gorbachev 's economic reforms succeeding .
Yet the Soviet leader 's readiness to embark on foreign visits and steady accumulation of personal power , particularly since the last Politburo reshuffle on Sept. 30 , do not suggest that Mr. Gorbachev is on the verge of being toppled ; nor does he look likely to reverse the powers of perestroika .
Indeed , the Soviet miners strike this summer clearly demonstrated that Mr. Gorbachev must proceed with economic reform .
But is he so clever that he has achieved the political equivalent of making water run uphill ?
And has he truly persuaded the Communist Party to accept economic change of a kind
that will , sooner or later , lead to its demise ?
An alternative and more convincing explanation , confirmed by recent events and a close inspection of the Gorbachev program , is that the new Soviet economic and social structures are intended to conform to a model other than that of the market .
For example , while the laws on individual labor activity allow a citizen to earn a living independent of the state , strict provisions are attached on how far this may lead to the development of a free market .
Before becoming self-employed , or setting up a cooperative , workers must seek permission from the local soviet ( council ) .
Permission is far from automatic : The soviets have the legal right to turn down applications and impose conditions , and they appear to be exercising these powers .
Private dressmaking , for example , is allowed in 10 Soviet republics but banned by five ; shoemaking is allowed in seven but illegal in nine .
The controls on cooperatives appeared relatively liberal when first introduced .
But that changed following a resolution from the Supreme Soviet banning cooperatives from operating in some areas of the economy , and permitting activity in others only if the cooperatives are under contract to the state .
All independent media activity is now illegal , which perhaps is not surprising , but so is the manufacture of perfume , cosmetics , household chemicals and sand candles .
Medical cooperatives , among the most successful in the U.S.S.R. , are banned from providing general-practitioner services ( their main source of income ) , carrying out surgery , and treating cancer patients , drug addicts and pregnant women .
Earlier this month , the Supreme Soviet adopted two more resolutions restricting the freedom of cooperatives : The first enables the soviets to set prices for which goods may be sold ; the second bans cooperatives from buying `` industrial and food goods '' from the state or other cooperatives .
If Mr. Gorbachev is looking toward unleashing the productive forces of the market , these latest resolutions are nothing short of reckless .
Along with some other revealing indicators , these developments suggest that while Mr. Gorbachev wishes to move away from some rigid central controls , he is bent on creating economic structures of a kind
that would scarcely find favor with the Austrian or Chicago schools of economic thought .
Mr. Gorbachev has ruled out the use of the market to solve the problem of insufficient consumer goods .
He told the Congress of People 's Deputies on May 30 : `` We do not share this approach , since it would immediately destroy the social situation and disrupt all the processes in the country .
Having rejected central economic planning for economic reasons , and the market for fear of the social ( political ) consequences , Mr. Gorbachev seeks a `` third way '' that would combine the discipline and controls of the former with the economic benefits of the latter .
Most important , this would leave the party intact and its monopoly of political power largely undisturbed .
Indeed , Mr. Gorbachev 's proposals display a close conceptual resemblance to the tenets of Italian fascism , whose architects spoke specifically of a `` third way '' : of having produced a historic synthesis of socialism and capitalism .
They , too , promised to combine economic efficiency with order and discipline .
The emergence of Russian corporatism had been anticipated in journalist George Urban 's introduction to a series of colloquies -- `` Can the Soviet System Survive Reform ? '' -- published this spring .
`` Communism will reach its final stage of development in a feckless Russo -- corporation-socialist in form , nationalistic in content and Oriental in style -- that will puzzle the world with alternating feats of realism and recklessness ... .
The fascist concept of corporatism envisaged an `` organic '' society in which citizens were spiritually and morally unified , and prepared to sacrifice themselves for the nation .
This unification was to be brought about through policies and institutions
that would unite workers and employers with government in a fully integrated and `` harmonic '' society .
The key to the creation of the `` organic '' state lay in the formation of `` natural '' groups
that would undertake the role of decision-making .
By contrast , a parliamentary system based on abstract political rights and groups was held to cause , rather than resolve , conflict .
The closeness of Soviet perestroika to the fascist social blueprint of Mussolini was evident when Mr. Gorbachev presented his economic vision to the Soviet Congress .
In doing so , he neither rejected a socialist planned economy nor embraced the free market .
Instead , he proposed a `` law-governed economy , '' in which there would be a `` clear-cut division between state direction of the economy and economic management .
'' The latter would be undertaken by `` enterprises , joint stock companies and cooperatives .
'' These would not function independently , but would act together to form `` combines , unions and associations '' to tackle problems and coordinate their activities .
Mr. Gorbachev is in a much stronger position to pursue the corporatist ideal than was Mussolini , who was never able to influence business giants such as Pirelli and Fiat .
The Soviet Communist Party has the power to shape corporate development and mold
it into a body dependent upon it .
To ensure the loyalty of the business sector , Mr. Gorbachev may offer concessions and powers
that will allow the business community to preserve its own interests , probably by restricting competition .
However , Mr. Gorbachev must ensure that within this `` alliance '' the business sector remains subordinate to the party .
At the same time , he must give it sufficient freedom to provide the economic benefits so desperately needed .
It is the promise of economic returns
that is supposed to make the corporatist model attractive to both
the party and labor .
The work force provides the third arm of the `` alliance .
'' Within the alliance
it is supposed to act as a balancing force , guarding against excessive control by government or abuse of its economic position by business , for either could result in a deterioration of its living standards ( under the new resolutions , workers councils may demand that a cooperative be closed or its prices be reduced ) .
By providing workers with the opportunity to move into the private sector where wages tend to be higher , and by holding out the promise of more consumer goods , Mr. Gorbachev hopes to revive the popularity of the party .
At the same time , the strategy requires that he deal effectively with those
who seek genuine Western-style political pluralism .
The most important development in Mr. Gorbachev 's policy for marginalizing the opposition movement is the claim that the U.S.S.R. also suffers from terrorism .
An increasing number of references by the Soviet press to opposition groups now active in the U.S.S.R. , particularly the Democratic Union , allege that they show `` terroristic tendencies '' and claim that they would be prepared to kill in order to achieve their aims .
It is possible that , in perpetuating such myths , the ground is being laid for the arrest of opposition activists on the ground of terrorism .
Mr. Gorbachev would appear to see his central task , however , as that of ensuring that foundations of an alliance among labor , capital and the state are properly laid before the demands for a multiparty system reach a crescendo .
If he were able to construct a popular and efficient corporatist system , he or his heir would be wellplaced to rein in political opposition , and to re-establish control in Eastern Europe .
The weaknesses in his plan do not lie in the political calculations -- Mr. Gorbachev is a consummate political leader , perhaps one of the greatest -- but in its economic prescription .
Contrary to widespread belief , Mussolini failed to live up to his promise to make the trains run on time ; it is doubtful whether Soviet-style corporatism will make Soviet trains run on time , or fill the shops with goods that the consumers so desperately crave .

The sale price of the unit , which makes packaging products , was to consist of cash , notes and an amount to be determined by the unit 's future performance .
Clarcor said it is inviting proposals from other prospective purchasers of the unit .
Both Clarcor and Anderson are based in Rockford , Ill .
Many investors give Michael Foods about as much chance of getting it together as Humpty Dumpty .
But now at least
there 's a glimmer of hope for the stock .
Burger King , which breaks thousands of fresh eggs
each morning , is quietly switching over to an alternative egg product made by Michael Foods .
Known as Easy Eggs , the product has disappointed investors .
When the company
this month announced lower-than-forecast sales of Easy Eggs , the stock dropped nearly 19 % .
Michael wo n't confirm the identities of any Easy Egg customers , nor will it say much of anything else .
Two Minneapolis shareholder suits in the past month have accused top officers of making `` various untrue statements .
'' These federal-court suits accuse the officers of failing to disclose that Easy Eggs were unlikely to sell briskly enough to justify all of Michael 's production capacity .
But at least Burger King has signed on , and says that by year end
it wo n't be using any shell eggs .
The Miami fast-food chain , owned by Grand Metropolitan of Britain , expects to consume roughly 34 million pounds of liquefied eggs annually .
So there is reason to believe that Michael 's hopes for a bacteria-free , long-shelf-life egg were n't all hype .
( Easy Eggs are pasteurized in a heat-using process .
) Still , caution is advisable .
A company official says Michael 's break-even volume on Easy Eggs is around 60 million pounds
a year -- apparently well above current shipments and a far cry from what
the company once suggested was a billion-pound market waiting for such a product .
Perhaps to debunk the analysts ' talk of over-capacity , Michael today will take some of the skeptics on a tour of its new Gaylord , Minn. , plant .
There has been no announcement of the Burger King arrangement by either party , possibly for fear
that McDonald 's and other fast-food rivals would seize on it in scornful advertising .
But Burger King operators independently confirm using Michael 's product .
Other institutional users reportedly include Marriott , which is moving away from fresh eggs on a region-by-region basis .
The extent of Marriott 's use is n't known , and Marriott officials could n't be reached for comment .
Michael Foods has attracted a good many short-sellers , the people
who sell borrowed shares in a bet that a stock price will drop and allow the return of cheaper shares to the lender .
Many analysts question management 's credibility .
`` The stock , in my opinion , is going to go lower , not only because of disappointing earnings but { because } the credibility gap is certainly not closing , '' says L. Craig Carver of Dain Bosworth .
Mr. Carver says that at a recent Dain-sponsored conference in New York , he asked Michael 's chief executive officer if the fourth quarter would be down .
The CEO , Richard G. Olson , replied `` yes , '' but would n't elaborate .
( The company did n't put out a public announcement .
A spokesman said later that Mr. Olson was being `` conservative '' in his estimate .
But the spokesman added that while Michael will earn less than last year 's $ 1.20
a share , it thinks Street estimates of $ 1 or so are low .
Analyst Robin Young of John Kinnard & Co. , Minneapolis , calls himself `` the last remaining bull on the stock .
'' He argues that Michael Foods is misunderstood : `` This is a growth company in the packaged food industry -- a rare breed , like finding a white rhino .
'' Earnings are n't keeping pace , he says , because of heavy investments in the egg technologies and drought-related costs in its potato business .
Mr. Carver , however , believes the company 's egg product wo n't help the bottom line in the short run , even though it `` makes sense -- it 's more convenient '' and justifies its price , which is higher than shell eggs , because of health and sanitation concerns .
Prospective competition is one problem .
a closely held New Jersey concern , Papetti High-Grade Egg Products Co. , rolled out an aseptically packaged liquefied item called Table Ready .
Company President Steve Papetti says Marriott will be among his clients as well .
Michael shares closed at 13 3\/4 yesterday in national over-the-counter trading .
Says New York-based short seller Mark Cohodes , `` In my mind
this is a $ 7 stock .
'' Michael late yesterday announced a $ 3.8 million stock buy-back program .
Michael , which also processes potatoes , still relies on spuds for about a fourth of its sales and nearly half its pretax profit .
But dry growing conditions in the Red River Valley of Minnesota and North Dakota are pushing spot prices of potatoes beyond what
Michael contracted to pay last spring .
Company lawyers recently sent letters to growers saying that Michael `` would take very seriously any effort ... to divert its contracted-for potatoes to other outlets .
'' Still , analysts believe that profit margins in the potato business will be down again this year .
Dime Savings Bank of New York was cleared by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to acquire Starpointe Savings Bank of Somerset , N.J. , the banks said .
Starpointe holders , who approved the plan last April , will receive $ 21 in cash
a share , or a total $ 63 million .
The FDIC cleared the move yesterday , and the banks must wait at least 30 days before closing the purchase .
A closing date has n't been set .
The thrifts agreed to the transaction in
August
The Supreme Court agreed to decide whether the federal Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. may require LTV Corp. to reassume funding responsibility for a $ 2.3 billion shortfall in the company 's pension plans .
The high court 's decision , expected next spring , may affect the stability of many large corporate pension plans
that have relied on the availability of pension insurance provided by the federal pension regulatory and insurance agency .
The agency , which is funded through insurance premiums from employers , insures pension benefits for some 30 million private-sector workers
who take part in single-employer pension plans .
It recently reported assets of $ 2.4 billion and liabilities of $ 4 billion .
In its appeal to the high court , the agency said the federal appeals court ruling , which favored LTV , threatened to transform the agency from an insurer of troubled pension plans into an `` open-ended source of industry bailouts .
The ruling also may determine how quickly LTV is able to complete its Chapter 11 reorganization .
LTV filed for protection under Chapter 11 in federal bankruptcy court in 1986 .
The filing was partly the result of the $ 2.3 billion shortfall in LTV 's three pension plans operated for its LTV Steel Co. subsidiary 's employees .
In January 1987 , as LTV Steel continued operating while under reorganization , the agency terminated the three LTV pension plans to keep its insurance liability from increasing .
Termination means that the agency 's insurance assumes the liabilities and pays the pension benefits already owed under the plans , but workers do n't accrue new benefits .
A few months later , under pressure from the United Steelworkers of America , LTV instituted a new program to provide retirement benefits similar to those in the terminated plans .
Because the federal pension agency had taken over the old plans , LTV would be responsible only for benefits paid under the new pension plans .
But the agency viewed the creation of the new plans as an abuse of federal pension law and an attempt to transfer the liability of the $ 2.3 billion shortfall from LTV to federal insurance .
The agency also concluded that LTV 's financial status had improved while it was under reorganization .
In September 1987 , it ordered LTV to reassume liability and funding for the three original plans .
LTV challenged the order , and a federal district court in New York in June 1988 ruled that the agency improperly ordered LTV to reassume responsibility for the plans .
In May , a federal appeals court in New York agreed that the agency acted unlawfully .
The appeals court said there was no evidence that Congress intended to allow the pension agency to consider a company 's creation of new benefit plans as a basis for ordering that company to reassume liability for old plans .
The appeals court also said the agency had to consider a company 's long-term ability to fund pension plans , not just short-term improved financial status .
In Dallas , LTV said that it was disappointed that the court agreed to hear the case because it believes the move will further delay its Chapter 11 proceedings .
The company has n't been able to come up with a reorganization plan , in part , because of the sizable disagreement with the pension agency .
But LTV , a steel , aerospace and energy concern , said it is confident that the Supreme Court will uphold the lower-court decisions and said it expects to continue discussions with the agency about a settlement while the case is being reviewed .

The average interest rate rose to 8.337 % at Citicorp 's $ 50 million weekly auction of 91-day commercial paper , or corporate IOUs , from 8.292 % at last week 's sale .
Accepted bids ranged from 8.328 % to 8.347 % .
However , Citicorp said that the average rate fell to 7.962 % at its $ 50 million auction of 182-day commercial paper from 7.986 % at last week 's sale .
Bids totaling $ 425 million were submitted .
Accepted bids were all at 7.962 % .
The bank holding company will auction another $ 50 million in each maturity next Tuesday .
West German and French authorities have cleared Dresdner Bank AG 's takeover of a majority stake in Banque Internationale de Placement ( BIP ) , Dresdner Bank said .
The approval , which had been expected , permits West Germany 's second-largest bank to acquire shares of the French investment bank .
In a first step , Dresdner Bank will buy 32.99 % of BIP for 1,015 French francs ( $ 162 ) a share , or 528 million francs ( $ 84.7 million ) .
Dresdner Bank said it will also buy all shares tendered by shareholders on the Paris Stock Exchange at the same price from today through Nov. 17 .
In addition , the bank has an option to buy a 30.84 % stake in BIP from Societe Generale after Jan. 1 , 1990 at 1,015 francs
a share .
Rockwell International Corp. reported flat operating earnings for the fourth quarter ended Sept. 30 .
The aerospace , automotive supply , electronics and printing-press concern also indicated that the first
half of fiscal 1990 could be rough .
In an interview , Donald Beall , chairman , said first-half profit certainly would trail the past year 's , primarily because of weakness in the heavy-truck and passenger-car markets .
Still , he added , if the industrial sector remains relatively stable , Rockwell should be able to recover in the second
half and about equal fiscal 1989 's operating profit of $ 630.9 million .
For fiscal 1989 's fourth quarter , Rockwell 's net income totaled $ 126.1 million , or 50 cents
That compares with operating earnings of $ 132.9 million , or 49 cents
The prior-year period includes a one-time favorable tax adjustment on the B-1B bomber program and another gain from sale of the industrial sewing-machine business , which made net $ 185.9 million , or 70 cents
Sales rose 4 % to $ 3.28 billion from $ 3.16 billion .
Mr. Beall said that he was generally pleased with the latest numbers and cited a particularly strong showing by the company 's electronics segment .
Overall , pretax electronics earnings soared 12 % to $ 107.9 million from $ 96.4 million .
All four areas had higher revenue for the three months ended Sept. 30 .
For the year , electronics emerged as Rockwell 's largest sector in terms of sales and earnings , muscling out aerospace for the first time .
The graphics business , which also was singled out by the chairman as a positive , saw its operating earnings for the quarter jump 79 % to $ 42.1 million from $ 23.5 million .
For the year , bolstered by the introduction of the Colorliner newspaper-printing press , graphics earnings almost doubled .
Aerospace earnings sagged 37 % for the quarter and 15 % for the year , largely due to lower B-1B program profit ; the last of the bombers rolled out in April 1988 .
That was partially offset by the resumption of space shuttle flights and increased demand for expendable launch-vehicle engines .
The company also took hits in the fourth quarters of 1989 and 1988 on a fixed-price weapons-modernization development program -- probably the C-130 gunship , according to analysts .
For fiscal 1989 , the company posted net of $ 734.9 million , or $ 2.87
a share , down from $ 811.9 million , or $ 3.04
a share , in fiscal 1988 .
Excluding one-time additions to profit in each year , earnings per share were $ 2.47 , up 7.4 % from $ 2.30 in fiscal 1988 .
Sales for the year rose 5 % to $ 12.52 billion from $ 11.95 billion in fiscal 1988 .
Diversified Investment Group Inc. said it agreed to be acquired by Star States Corp. for stock valued at $ 13.75
a share , or about $ 24.4 million .
Diversified , the holding company for Fidelity Federal Savings & Loan Association , said the agreement also gives Star States
the option to acquire 588,300 of Diversified 's 1,774,326 shares outstanding `` under certain circumstances .
The acquisition would give Wilmington , Del.-based Star States access to the Pennsylvania market .
The agreement is subject to regulatory approval and resolution of lawsuits brought by certain Diversified holders in connection with the proposed merger .
This is in response to George Melloan 's Business World column `` The Housing Market Is a Bigger Mess Than You
Think '' ( op-ed page , Sept. 26 ) .
In Houston , we have seen how bad the housing problem can become .
Unused houses deteriorate rapidly , affecting the value of nearby homes ; in a domino effect , the entire neighborhood can fall victim .
At this stage
some people just `` walk away '' from homes where the mortgage exceeds current market value .
But most of them could have afforded to keep up their payments -- they chose not to do so .
The problem is so vast that we need to try innovative solutions -- in small-scale experiments .
Here are some ideas :
1 ) Foreclosed homes could be sold by the FHA for no down payment ( the biggest obstacle to young buyers ) , but with personal liability for the mortgage ( no walking away by choice ) .
2 ) Encourage long-term occupancy by forgiving one month 's payment ( off the tail end of the mortgage ) for every six months paid ; or perhaps have the down payment deferred to the end of the mortgage ( balloon ) , but `` forgiven '' on a monthly pro-rata basis as long as the owner remains the occupant .
3 ) Develop rental agreements with exclusive purchase options for the renter .
An occupant will , in most every case , be better for the home and neighborhood than a vacant house .
In this way , the house is not dumped on to a glutted market .
John F. Merrill
Houston
The Federal Housing Administration , Veterans Administration and the Department of Housing and Urban Development further aggravate the problem of affordable housing stock by `` buying in '' to their foreclosed properties ( of which there are , alas , many ) at an inflated `` balance due '' -- say $ 80,000 on a house worth $ 55,000 -- instead of allowing a free market to price the house for what
it 's really worth .
Worse , the properties then sit around deteriorating for maybe a year or so , but are resold eventually ( because of the attractiveness of the low down payment , etc .
) to a marginal buyer
who ca n't afford both
the mortgage and needed repairs ; and having little vested interest
that buyer will walk away and the vicious cycle repeats itself

The U.S. economy grew at a moderate 2.5 % annual rate in the third quarter , the same pace as the second quarter , despite the worst trade performance in six years , the Commerce Department reported .
Personal spending , buoyed by a burst of automobile buying , was the main catalyst to the economy 's expansion .
But trade , one of the economy 's main forces in the past few years , showed a sharp deterioration .
Imports of goods and services soared , while exports were flat .
Some economists found the mixture ominous .
`` For the past two years , the foreign trade sector has been a major contributor to economic growth .
You ca n't rely now solely on consumer spending to sustain the economy on a solid growth path , '' said Norman Robertson , chief economist at Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh .
Although the economy showed no change of pace from the second quarter , many analysts expect it to slow considerably in the fourth quarter as demand for autos falls , partly because of higher prices on models introduced last month .
Many economists think the rise in the value of the U.S. dollar
this year will further crimp progress in trade , because it makes exports more expensive and imports cheaper .
And business investment -- which slowed in the third quarter , according to yesterday 's report -- is expected to continue to be sluggish .
A sharp reduction in inflation was by far the brightest spot in the report on the real gross national product -- the inflation-adjusted market value of all the goods and services
the economy produced .
An inflation gauge
that measures the quarterly change in prices of an array of goods and services slowed its growth to a 2.9 % annual rate in the third quarter from 5 % in the second .
Much of the moderation came from declining energy prices , which have since turned up a bit , analysts said .
Consequently , Michael Darby , undersecretary for economic affairs at the Commerce Department , said inflation probably will edge up from the third-quarter rate in the final three months of 1989 .
But he said he believes the second quarter 's 5 % rate `` will prove to have been this year 's peak quarterly inflation rate .
Generally , the Bush administration expressed satisfaction with the economy 's progress as it heads into its eighth year of sustained growth next month .
Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady called the 2.5 % pace `` good , solid growth , '' although he said he expects the expansion to slow in the fourth quarter .
He added : `` Inflation is lower than I think people expected it to be , and I think that 's good news .
But administration officials were concerned over the bleak trade report , which showed the deficit in the country 's trade of goods and services swelling to a $ 74 billion annual rate in the third quarter from a $ 51 billion rate in the second quarter .
Mr. Darby called it
a `` disappointment '' but predicted exports will pick up again .
`` We were unprepared for the deterioration in net exports , '' said Daniel Van Dyke , vice president of U.S. forecasting at Bank of America in San Francisco .
`` I ca n't believe it will continue , '' he added , noting that the economies of the country 's major trading partners are strong and prices of U.S. products are still competitive .
Some analysts also were disturbed by a pickup in the growth of business inventories .
While a buildup of these stocks adds to GNP , it can hurt the economy because a pileup of unsold goods can lead to production cuts and layoffs .
According to the report , inventories outside the farm sector grew at an annual rate of $ 24.6 billion in the third quarter , up from a $ 19.5 billion pace in the second quarter .
Manufacturers ' stocks fattened at an $ 18.4 billion annual rate , up from $ 8.3 billion .
`` That suggests there is a little more inventory overhang than some people expected , '' said Edward Boss , senior financial economist at Continental Bank in Chicago .
`` I do n't think it 's anything
that 's going to cause a downturn in economic activity .
But it will slow production .
Devastation from Hurricane Hugo , which slammed into the Southeast coast in late September , diminished personal income by about $ 4 billion , the department said , but it called the effect on the roughly $ 5 trillion economy `` negligible .
Except for the loss from the hurricane , all the figures were adjusted for seasonal factors and inflation .
Here are some of the major components of the gross national product expressed in seasonally adjusted annual rates in billions of constant ( 1982 ) dollars :
In the third quarter , the implicit price deflator fell to 2.9 % of the 1982 average , from 4.6 % in the previous quarter .
Richard D. Sutton , 64 years old , chairman of this bank-holding company , was named acting president and chief executive officer of the company and its First National Bank of Toms River subsidiary .
Joseph W. Robertson , 61 , was dismissed from those posts , the company said .
He could n't be reached and a company spokesman would n't comment on the dismissal .
Mr. Robertson was also removed from the board of First National Bank of New Jersey-Salem County , another unit , and the Toms River bank .
Metallgesellschaft AG said it agreed to acquire 51 % of Lentjes AG from the Ferdinand Lentjes Foundation .
Metallgesellschaft , a diversified Frankfurt , West Germany-based metals group , said it is buying the stake in the specialized engineering company to expand its production of environmental supplies for power plants .
Lentjes ' product mix of specialized boilers and pipes provides a good fit with its own Lurgi G.m.b .
H. plant engineering unit , the company said .
The move is part of a strategy to focus on its core metals trading , processing and plant engineering activities while shedding peripheral units , the company said .
Lentjes had 1988 sales of 800 million marks ( $ 434.4 million ) and has a current order backlog of 2.5 billion marks .
The sale comes in place of a planned initial public offering of Lentjes stock .
A plan to bring the stock to market before year end apparently was upset by the recent weakness of Frankfurt share prices .
Mips Computer Systems Inc. today will unveil a new general-purpose computer
that will compete with more expensive machines from companies such as Sun Microsystems Inc. and Digital Equipment Corp .
The closely held Sunnyvale , Calif. , company also will announce an agreement to supply computers to Control Data Corp. , which will sell Mips machines under its own label .
The new Mips machine , called the RC6280 , will cost $ 150,000 for a basic system .
The computer processes 55 million instructions per second and uses only one central processing chip , unlike many rival machines using several processors .
The machine employs reduced instruction-set computing , or RISC , technology .
At that price , an analyst familiar with the machine said , the computer offers up to 10 times
the performance of similar machines .
`` In the price range
it 's a tremendously high-performing product , '' said Sandy Gant , an analyst at the market-research firm InfoCorp .
The machine is part of an effort by Mips to establish itself as a supplier of computers , not just of integrated-circuit technology .
Mips also wants to wedge into markets other than traditional RISC applications such as engineering ; Mips said the new machine will also be used by businesses and for communications .
`` This clearly demonstrates that Mips is a systems company rather than just a chip company , '' said Mips Vice President John Hime .
The Control Data deal is a boon for Mips because it gives the
the five-year-old company one more ally as it battles more established electronic concerns such as Sun , Hewlett-Packard Co. , Motorola Inc. and Intel Corp. for the emerging market for RISC machines .
RISC technology speeds up a computer by simplifying the internal software .
For Mips , which expects revenue of $ 100 million this year , big-name allies such as Control Data are essential to attract software developers to the company 's RISC architecture .
`` The thing
it says about Mips is that they 're on a roll right now , '' said Ms. Gant at InfoCorp .
`` They 're getting some major wins , '' she added .
Last month , for example , Mips agreed to supply its computers to Nixdorf Computer AG of West Germany and France 's Groupe Bull .
Sony Corp. , Tandem Computers Inc. and Digital Equipment have agreed to sell MIPS computers and companies such as Japan 's NEC Corp. and West Germany 's Siemens A.G. have agreed to make Mips chips under license .
Today 's agreement gives Control Data
a machine to compete against Digital and other general-purpose computer makers , said John Logan , a computer-market analyst at Aberdeen Group Inc. of Boston .
The machine is essentially a mainframe computer , he said .
`` Suddenly CDC ( Control Data ) has a competitive product to fight back against the VAX9000 , '' a machine Digital announced last month , he added .
Control Data , based in Minneapolis , Minn. , expects its sales of Mips systems , including the new RC6280 , to amount to more than $ 100 million by the end of 1991 , Mips said .
Nixdorf , Bull and others will also sell versions of the machine , said Mips President Robert Miller .
Mips will start shipping its new machine in the first quarter of 1990 , he said .
The machine uses a single processor , which makes it easier to program than competing machines using several processors .
The computer can process 13.3 million calculations called floating-point operations
every second .
The machine can run software written for other Mips computers , the company said .
Harley-Davidson Inc. filed suit in federal court here , alleging that a group
that holds 6.2 % of its stock made `` false , deceptive and misleading '' statements in recent regulatory filings and public announcements .
Harley-Davidson 's complaint claims that the group , led by investor Malcolm I. Glazer , violated securities laws by failing to disclose plans to purchase 15 % of the company 's shares outstanding and that when the required Hart-Scott-Rodino filing eventually was made , it did n't disclose the group 's alleged earlier violation of the so-called prior-notice requirements of the law .
Mr. Glazer could n't immediately be reached to comment .
But when Harley last week publicly questioned the legality of the group 's filing procedures , the Rochester , N.Y. , investor said `` we complied with every law , '' and he denied any wrongdoing .
The Glazer group said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing in early October that it may seek a controlling interest in Harley-Davidson , or seek representation on the company 's board .
Harley has said it does n't intend to be acquired by the Glazer group or any other party .
John F. Barrett , 40 , formerly executive vice president and chief financial officer , was named president and chief operating officer , posts

Wall Street 's big securities firms face the prospect of having their credit ratings lowered .
The reason : Risks from the firms ' new `` merchant banking '' activities are rising as revenue from the industry 's traditional business erodes .
The downgrading of debt issued by CS First Boston Inc. , parent of First Boston Corp. , by Moody 's Investors Service Inc. , coupled with a Moody 's announcement that Shearson Lehman Hutton Holdings Inc. is under review for a possible downgrade , sent shivers through the brokerage community
With the shudders came the realization that some of Wall Street 's biggest players are struggling to maintain the stellar credit standing required to finance their activities profitably .
Securities firms are among the biggest issuers of commercial paper , or short-term corporate IOUs , which
they sell to finance their daily operations .
The biggest firms still retain the highest ratings on their commercial paper .
But Moody 's warned that Shearson 's commercial paper rating could be lowered soon , a move
that would reduce Shearson 's profit margins on its borrowings and signal trouble ahead for other firms .
Shearson is 62%-owned by American Express Co .
`` Just as the 1980s bull market transformed the U.S. securities business , so too will the more difficult environment of the 1990s , '' says Christopher T. Mahoney , a Moody 's vice president .
`` A sweeping restructuring of the industry is possible .
'' Standard & Poor 's Corp. says First Boston , Shearson and Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. , in particular , are likely to have difficulty shoring up their credit standing in months ahead .
What worries credit-rating concerns the most is that Wall Street firms are taking long-term risks with their own capital via leveraged buy-out and junk bond financings .
That 's a departure from their traditional practice of transferring almost all financing risks to investors .
Whereas conventional securities financings are structured to be sold quickly , Wall Street 's new penchant for leveraged buy-outs and junk bonds is resulting in long-term lending commitments
that stretch out for months or years .
`` The recent disarray in the junk bond market suggests that brokers may become longer-term creditors than they anticipated and may face long delays '' in getting their money back , says Jeffrey Bowman , a vice president at S&P , which raised a warning flag for the industry in April when it downgraded CS First Boston .
`` Wall Street is facing a Catch-22 situation , '' says Mr. Mahoney of Moody 's .
Merchant banking , where firms commit their own money , `` is getting riskier , and there 's less of it to go around .
'' In addition , he says , the buy-out business is under pressure `` because of the junk bond collapse , '' meaning that returns are likely to decline as the volume of junk-bond financings shrinks .
In a leveraged buy-out , a small group of investors acquires a company in a transaction financed largely by borrowing , with the expectation that the debt will be paid with funds generated by the acquired company 's operations or sales of its assets .
In a recent report , Moody 's said it `` expects intense competition to occur through the rest of the century in the securities industry , which , combined with overcapacity , will create poor prospects for profitability .
'' It said that the `` temptation for managements to ease this profit pressure by taking greater risks is an additional rating factor .
Both Moody 's and S&P cited First Boston 's reliance in recent years on merchant banking , which has been responsible for a significant portion of the closely held firm 's profit .
The recent cash squeeze at Campeau Corp. , First Boston 's most lucrative client of the decade , is proving costly to First Boston because it arranged more than $ 3 billion of high-yield , high-risk junk financings for Campeau units .
In addition , a big loan that First Boston made to Ohio Mattress Co .
was n't repaid on time when its $ 450 million junk financing for a buy-out of the bedding company was withdrawn .
`` These two exposures alone represent a very substantial portion of CS First Boston 's equity , '' Moody
's said .
`` Total merchant banking exposures are in excess of the firm 's equity .
'' CS First Boston , however , benefits from the backing of its largest shareholder , Credit Suisse , Switzerland 's third largest bank .
Shearson also has been an aggressive participant in the leveraged buy-out business .
But its earnings became a major disappointment as its traditional retail , or individual investor , business showed no signs of rebounding from the slump
that followed the October 1987 stock market crash .
In addition , Shearson 's listed $ 2 billion of capital is overstated , according to the rating concerns , because it includes $ 1.7 billion of goodwill .
Shearson `` really only has $ 300 million of capital , '' says Mr. Bowman of S&P .
A Shearson spokesman said the firm is n't worried .
`` A year ago , Moody 's also had Shearson under review for possible downgrade , '' he said .
`` After two months of talks , our rating was maintained .
'' Drexel , meanwhile , already competes at a disadvantage to its big Wall Street rivals because it has a slightly lower commercial paper rating .
The collapse of junk bond prices and the cancellation of many junk bond financings apparently have taken their toll on closely held Drexel , the leading underwriter in that market .
The firm also has been hit with big financial settlements with the government stemming from its guilty plea to six felonies related to a big insider-trading scandal .
Drexel
this year eliminated its retail or individual customer business , cutting the firm 's workforce almost in half to just over 5,000 .
Recently , Drexel circulated a private financial statement among several securities firms showing that its earnings performance has diminished this year from previous years .
The firm 's capital , moreover , has n't grown at the same rate as in the past , officials at these firms say .
Drexel remains confident of its future creditworthiness .
`` We 're well positioned with $ 1.7 billion of capital , '' a Drexel spokesman said .
`` And as a leading investment and merchant banking firm , the fact that we are no longer subject to the uncertainties and vicissitudes of the retail business is a major plus in our view .
Moreover , we 've probably been the most aggressive firm on the Street in reducing costs , which are down around 40 % over the last six months .
The United Kingdom High Court declared illegal a variety of interest-rate swap transactions and options deals between a London borough council and commercial banks .
The ruling could lead to the cancellation of huge bank debts
the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham ran up after losing heavily on swap transactions .
As many as 70 U.K. and international banks stand to lose several hundred million pounds should the decision be upheld and set a precedent for other municipalities .
An appeal is expected .
In response to the ruling , gilt futures swiftly plunged more than a point yesterday before recovering much of the loss by the end of the session .
Gilts , or British government bonds , which also fell sharply initially , retraced some of the losses to end about 3\/8 point lower .
The council , which is alleged to have engaged in over 600 deals valued at over # 6 billion ( $ 9.5 billion ) , lost millions of pounds from soured swap deals .
At one point , Hammersmith is reported to have accounted for as much as 10 % of the sterling market in interest-rate swap dealings .
When two parties engage in an interest-rate swap , they are betting against each other on future rates .
Thus , an institution obligated to make fixed-rate interest payments on debt swaps the payments with another making floating-rate payments .
In most of the British transactions , the municipalities agreed to make floating-rate payments to banks , which would make fixed-rate payments .
As interest rates rose , municipalities owed the banks more than the banks were paying them .
The court hearing began in early October at the request of Anthony Hazell , district auditor for Hammersmith , who argued that local councils are n't vested with constitutional authority to engage in such capital-markets activities .
The council backed the audit commission 's stand that the swap transactions are illegal .
Although the Hammersmith and Fulham council was by far the most active local authority engaging in such capital-markets transactions , the court decision could set a precedent for similar transactions by 77 other local councils .
`` While this court ruling was only on Hammersmith , it will obviously be very persuasive in other cases of a similar nature , '' a solicitor representing one of the banks said .
Already , 10 local councils have refused to honor fees and payments to banks incurred during various swaps dealings .
Other financial institutions involved include Barclays Bank PLC , Midland Bank PLC , Security Pacific Corp. , Chemical Banking Corp. 's Chemical Bank , Citicorp 's Citibank and Mitsubishi Finance International .
If the banks exhaust all avenues of appeal , it is possible that they would seek to have the illegality ruling work both
ways , some market sources said .
Banks could seek to recover payments to local authorities in instances where the banks made net payments to councils .
Officials from the various banks involved are expected to meet during the next few days to consider other arrangements with local authorities
that could be questionable .
The banks have 28 days to file an appeal against the ruling and are expected to do so shortly .
As a money manager and a grass-roots environmentalist , I was very disappointed to read in the premiere issue of Garbage that The Wall Street Journal uses 220,000 metric tons of newsprint
each year , but that only 1.4 % of it comes from recycled paper .
By contrast , the Los Angeles Times , for example , uses 83 % recycled paper .
With newspapers being the largest single component of solid waste in our landfills , and with our country overflowing with trash , all sectors of our society and all types of businesses must become more responsible in our use and disposal of precious natural resources .
The Wall Street Journal is an excellent publication that I enjoy reading ( and must read ) daily .
Please make me and thousands of other readers more comfortable with our daily purchase of your newspaper by raising your environmental standards to your overall impeccable quality levels , and increase your use of recycled paper .

Philip Morris Cos. is launching a massive corporate advertising campaign
that will put the tobacco giant 's name in TV commercials for the first time since the early 1950s , when it stopped advertising its namesake cigarette brand on television .
The campaign , a patriotic celebration of the 200th anniversary of the Bill of Rights , does n't mention cigarettes or smoking ; cigarette ads have been prohibited on television since 1971 .
But even before it begins , the campaign is drawing fire from anti-smoking advocates , who criticize Philip Morris 's attempt to bolster its beleaguered image by wrapping itself in the document
that is a cornerstone of American democracy .
Philip Morris , which became the U.S. 's largest food company last year with its $ 12.9 billion acquisition of Kraft Inc. , seems determined to evolve beyond its roots in Marlboro country .
The company 's research suggests that its name recognition among most consumers remains unusually low , although its array of brands -- including Maxwell House coffee , Jell-O , Cheez Whiz , and Miller beer -- blanket supermarket shelves .
The company is expected to spend about $ 30 million
a year on its two-year corporate campaign , created by WPP Group 's Ogilvy & Mather unit in New York .
The initial spots will appear during morning and prime-time news shows .
Philip Morris hopes that by taking its Bill of Rights theme to the airwaves , in addition to publications , it will reach the broadest possible audience .
Until now , its corporate ads , mainly promoting its sponsorship of the arts , have appeared almost exclusively in newspapers and magazines .
`` Most people -- whether in Toledo , Tucson or Topeka -- have n't got a clue
we are , '' says Guy L. Smith , Philip Morris 's vice president of corporate affairs .
`` If they think well of the company through our support of the Bill of Rights , it follows they 'll think well of our products .
'' Mr. Smith says the Bill of Rights commercial , which trumpets the themes of liberty and freedom of expression , is n't designed to have any special appeal for smokers .
Although Philip Morris typically tries to defend the rights of smokers with free-choice arguments , `` this has nothing to do with cigarettes , nor will it ever , '' the spokesman says .
But some anti-smoking activists disagree , expressing anger at what
they see as the company 's attempt to purchase innocence by association .
`` I 'm outraged because this company is portraying itself at the heart of American culture and political freedom and in fact
it 's a killer , '' says Michael Pertschuk , former chairman of the Federal Trade Commission and a tobacco-industry critic .
`` It should be treated like the Medellin { drug } mafia , not the Founding Fathers .
Mr. Pertschuk adds that the new commercial dovetails perfectly with major aspects of Philip Morris 's political strategy .
These include trying to protect its print advertising by invoking the First Amendment , and wooing blacks by portraying itself as a protector of civil rights .
( The commercial features , among others , the voice of Martin Luther King Jr. , the slain civil rights leader .
Many marketers say Philip Morris 's approach will be effective , but they agree that the ads ' implied
smoking message is unmistakable .
`` This is clever , subliminal advertising
that really says , ` Smokers have rights , too , ' '' says Al Ries , chairman of Trout & Ries Inc. , a Greenwich , Conn. , marketing strategy firm .
`` This is designed to get the wagons in a circle and defend the smoking franchise .
Richard Winger , a partner at Boston Consulting Group , adds : `` It 's very popular to drape yourself in the flag these days .
If you can do that and at the same time send a message
that supports your business , that 's brilliant .
RJR Nabisco Inc. and American Brands Inc. say they have no plans to follow Philip Morris 's lead .
( Indeed , RJR Nabisco is currently under fire for having sent 80-second videotapes touting its Now brand to consumers
who smoke American Brands ' Carltons .
Despite the criticism , Philip Morris 's corporate campaign runs little risk of getting yanked off the tube .
`` They are n't showing James Madison taking a puff or lighting up , '' says Laurence Tribe , a professor of constitutional law at Harvard University .
they are trying to do is borrow some of the legitimacy of the Bill of Rights itself .
Shoney 's Inc. said it will report a write-off of $ 2.5 million , or seven cents
a share , for its fourth quarter ended yesterday .
The restaurant operator cited transaction costs from its 1988 recapitalization as a result of a $ 160 million restructuring of its bank debt .
The write-off will be reported as an extraordinary item in the company 's 1989 operating results .
In addition , the effective interest rate on the $ 410 million of total remaining bank debt after the restructuring is 10.66 % .
The combined effect of these changes is expected to save the company about $ 4 million in interest expenses next year , or six cents
Shoney 's said the latest restructuring affected bank indebtedness
that was incurred to finance $ 585 million of the company 's $ 728 million recapitalization
that took place in
The company has made payments of $ 175 million against the original $ 585 million of bank debt incurred in connection with the recapitalization .
These payments consisted of $ 54 million in scheduled payments and $ 121 million in prepayments , funded by $ 82.8 million from operating cash flow , zero-coupon subordinated debt and assets sales .
PRIMERICA Corp. , New York , raised its quarterly 14 % to eight cents
a share , from seven cents , payable Nov. 24 to stock of record Nov. 6 .
The financial services company , which has about 98.8 million shares outstanding , noted its `` continued confidence in the ongoing strength of the operations .
It was the second anniversary of the 1987 crash , but this time
it was different .
Stocks rallied on good earnings reports and on data
that showed less inflation than expected .
Blue chips led the march up in heavy trading .
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 39.55 points to 2683.20 .
The 30 industrials led the market higher from the opening bell as foreign buyers stepped in .
By afternoon , the broader market joined the advance in full strength .
Standard & Poor 's 500-stock Index rose 5.37 to 347.13 and the Nasdaq composite index jumped 7.52 to 470.80 .
New York Stock Exchange volume swelled to 198,120,000 shares .
The industrials were up about 60 points in the afternoon , but cautious investors took profits before the close .
Traders said a variety of factors triggered the rally .
The consumer price index rose 0.2 % in September , while many economists were looking for a 0.4 % increase .
Stock-index arbitrage buy programs -- in which traders buy stock against offsetting positions in futures to lock in price differences -- helped the rally 's momentum .
The euphoria was such that investors responded to good earnings reports of companies such as American Express , while ignoring the disappointing profits of companies such as Caterpillar , analysts said .
Stock-index arbitrage trading was a minor influence in yesterday 's rally , traders said .
Institutional buyers were the main force pushing blue chips higher .
To the amazement of some traders , takeover stocks were climbing again .
Hilton rose 2 7\/8 to 100 , for example .
Last Friday , takeover traders spilled out of Hilton , knocking the stock down 21 1\/2 to 85 .
Among other stocks involved in restructurings or rumored to be so : Holiday Corp. gained 1 7\/8 to 73 and Honeywell rose 2 7\/8 to 81 1\/2 .
One floor trader noted in astonishment that nobody seemed to mind the news that British Airways is n't making a special effort to revive the UAL buy-out .
The announcement of the buy-out
's troubles triggered the market 's nose dive a week ago .
Takeover enthusiasm may have been renewed when an investor group disclosed yesterday that it had obtained all the financing required to complete its $ 1.6 billion leveraged buy-out of American Medical International .
`` That 's put some oomph back into this market , '' said Peter VandenBerg , a vice president of equity trading at Shearson Lehman Hutton .
But some traders thought there was less to the rally than met the eye .
`` There is no strength behind this rally , '' asserted Chung Lew , head trader at Kleinwort Benson North America .
`` It 's traders squaring positions .
It 's not good ; the market is setting up for another fall .
Indeed , many traders said that uncertainty about today 's monthly expiration of stocks-index futures and options , and options on individual stocks , prompted a lot of buying by speculative traders
who were unwinding positions
that were bets on declining stock prices .
The number of outstanding contracts in the October Major Market Index jumped from 5,273 on Friday to 9,023 on Monday .
The MMI is a 20-stock index that mimics
the Dow Jones Industrial Average .
Outstanding contracts are those
that remain to be liquidated .
By Wednesday , the outstanding October contracts amounted to 8,524 , representing about $ 1.13 billion in stock , noted Donald Selkin , head of stock-index futures research at Prudential-Bache Securities , who expects a volatile expiration today .
`` There has been a tremendous increase '' in MMI positions , Mr. Selkin said .
Consumer stocks once again set the pace for blue-chip issues .

For the sixth time in as many years , Continental Airlines has a new senior executive .
Gone is D. Joseph Corr , the airline 's chairman , chief executive and president , appointed only last December .
Mr. Corr resigned to pursue other business interests , the airline said .
He could not be reached for comment .
Succeeding him as chairman and chief executive will be Frank Lorenzo , chairman and chief executive of Continental 's parent , Texas Air Corp .
Mr. Lorenzo , 49 years old , is reclaiming the job
that was his before Mr. Corr signed on .
The airline also named Mickey Foret as president .
Mr. Foret , 44 , is a 15-year veteran of Texas Air and Texas International Airlines , its predecessor .
Most recently he had been executive vice president for planning and finance at Texas Air .
Top executives at Continental have n't lasted long , especially those recruited from outside .
But Mr. Corr 's tenure was shorter than most .
The 48-year-old Mr. Corr was hired largely because he was credited with returning Trans World Airlines Inc. to profitability while he was its president from 1986 to 1988 .
Before that , he was an executive with a manufacturing concern .
At Continental
he cut money-losing operations , which helped produce a modest profit in this year 's second quarter .
But Mr. Corr , a stunt pilot in his spare time , was understood to be frustrated by what
he regarded as limited freedom under Mr. Lorenzo .
While not officially an executive at Continental during Mr. Corr 's tenure , Mr. Lorenzo is known for keeping close tabs on Texas Air 's operating units .
Continental is Texas Air 's flagship and was built painfully to its present size under Mr. Lorenzo after emerging from bankruptcy proceedings in 1986 .
It 's unclear what role , if any , Mr. Lorenzo 's recent exploration of a possible sale of a stake in Continental had in Mr. Corr 's departure .
One source familiar with the airline said , however , that Mr. Corr was n't informed in advance during the summer when Mr. Lorenzo began discussions with potential buyers .
During his tenure , Mr. Corr attempted through a series of meetings to inform managers of some of the company 's future plans , traveled widely to talk to employees and backed training sessions designed to improve the carrier 's image .
Mr. Foret is one of a handful of executives Mr. Lorenzo has relied on over the years .
Previously , he had served in financial planning positions at the company 's Eastern Airlines unit .
Another longtime ally , Phil Bakes , currently heads Eastern , now in Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings .
Mr. Bakes previously had a turn at running Continental .
Among the other alumni are Stephen Wolf , now chairman of UAL Inc. , and Thomas Plaskett , president of Pan
Corp .
PaineWebber Group Inc. ordered a major pullback from program trading amid mounting pressure on Wall Street from some of its biggest investors .
Other big brokerage firms also showed signs of retreating from controversial computer-assisted trading , which has become a liability for Wall Street after this month 's 190-point , Friday-the-13th plunge in the Dow Jones Industrial Average .
Yesterday , Goldman , Sachs & Co. said it will campaign for significant curbs on the most common form of program trading -- stock-index arbitrage .
Also , other firms including American Express Co. 's Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. unit and Oppenheimer & Co. -- are debating whether to follow PaineWebber 's lead and pull back from program trading .
And Sears , Roebuck & Co. 's Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. unit , which used to be the 10th-biggest program trader on the New York Stock Exchange , said it is sending a program-bashing letter to more than two million clients over the next month , among other actions
that may include a nationwide advertising campaign .
`` Program trading is simply an idea
whose time has passed , '' said Dean Witter Chairman Philip J. Purcell .
Program trading , which
last month accounted for a record 13.8 % of New York Stock Exchange volume , refers to a variety of computer-assisted trading of large amounts of stocks , stock-index futures and options .
Much of the trading is geared to short-term gains caused by brief price swings in volatile markets .
Wall Street pulled back briefly from program trading after the October 1987 stock crash .
But then it charged back in , emboldened by post-crash studies
that exonerated program trading from causing the crash ( though not from causing big price swings ) .
And now it 's reeling from a renewed outcry -- this time not only from small individual investors , but from major institutions
that control big trading commissions .
The criticism came to a head Tuesday when Kemper Corp. , a big insurance and financial-services firm , cut off four Wall Street firms
that engage in program trading -- Oppenheimer , General Electric Co. 's Kidder , Peabody & Co. , Morgan Stanley & Co. and Bear , Stearns & Co. -- from getting any more of Kemper 's stock-trading business .
Other big investors are following Kemper 's lead .
Yesterday , another institutional investor -- Keystone Group Inc. , a Boston mutual-fund company -- said it will boycott firms
that engage in index arbitrage .
The firm manages $ 2.5 billion in stock mutual funds .
`` These firms , by using proprietary index-arbitrage trading techniques , have been competing with their own customers , '' said Albert H. Elfner III , president of Keystone .
`` Their actions can hurt long-term , fundamentally oriented investors , and have undermined public trust in the fairness of the markets .
Another institutional investor , Penn Mutual Life Insurance Co. , said it might join Kemper in avoiding program-trading brokerage firms .
Such companies as Keystone , Kemper and Penn Mutual are dependent on business from small investors , who have been peppering them with complaints about program trading and have retreated from the financial markets since the 1987 crash .
`` We have n't decided to blacklist any firms .
But there 's a chance
we might , '' said David Wilson , head of Penn Mutual 's $ 100 million stock portfolio .
`` We are very upset about what has happened to the stock market .
Program trading is almost like sitting on a calm beach and have a tidal wave hit you .
Penn Mutual owns the regional brokerage firm Janney Montgomery Scott Inc. in Philadelphia .
Yesterday , several officials from Janney visited the New York Stock Exchange to lobby against program trading .
The firm 's executive committee is considering drafting an anti-program-trading letter to its clients and to Congress .
Donald B. Marron , PaineWebber chairman and chief executive officer , said the firm decided after the close of trading yesterday that it would stop doing index arbitrage for clients .
It already had ceased that form of trading for its own account .
`` It seems clear to us that index arbitrage is a big contributor to { the market 's } volatility and it 's reducing confidence in the market for institutional and retail clients , '' Mr. Marron said .
He said index arbitrage is `` clearly , purely a speculative , hedging arbitrage strategy '' that is `` contributing to excess volatility .
PaineWebber , the fifth-biggest program trader on the Big Board so far this year , will continue to engage in other forms of program trading besides index arbitrage , and indeed is Wall Street 's foremost practitioner of non-arbitrage forms of program trading in terms of volume .
But Mr. Marron said these other forms of program trading , such as using computers to buy or sell a range of stocks but not stock futures , help bring `` liquidity '' to the market .
Goldman , which does n't do index arbitrage for itself but does for customers , is concerned about the fallout .
`` Our corporate , institutional and individual clients are concerned about what
they perceive to be excessive volatility , '' said Robert E. Mnuchin , senior partner in charge of Goldman 's equity trading .
`` We share their concern .
Consequently , we will recommend { to regulators } significant curbs on electronic access for waves of stocks
which add volatility to the markets .
'' He declined to comment further .
Shearson , the 11th-biggest program trader , also does n't do index arbitrage for itself .
Yet some officials at a regular management meeting Wednesday night urged the firm 's leaders to pull out of the practice completely , to appease small investors .
`` The question was : Do we get mileage out of not doing it for clients ? '' said a Shearson official .
But so far , `` the answer is no .
Oppenheimer , a relatively minor program trader , is also reviewing its index-arbitrage operation .
Not only was it stung by Kemper 's boycott , but it suffered an approximate $ 2.5 million index-trading loss during the Friday-the-13th plunge .
An Oppenheimer spokesman said index chief David Liptak had left the firm and would n't be replaced .
For the time being , James Wiess , an associate of Mr. Liptak 's , `` is now our index arbitrager , '' said the spokesman .
The program-trading debate has caused splits even within some Wall Street brokerage firms .
At Kidder Peabody , for example , the firm 's leaders staunchly defend its aggressive use of index arbitrage for both Kidder 's own account and for customers .
Kidder is the most active index arbitrager on the Big Board so far this year , trading about two million shares
a day in the strategy .
However , Kidder 's 1,400 brokers are n't so sure about index arbitrage .
Said Charles V. Sheehan , Kidder 's managing director in charge of retail business : `` To try to talk to { stockbrokers } about the virtues of program trading is like trying to talk about the virtues of nuclear power to the Audubon Society .
'' He conceded `` there is a little bit of a conflict there '' between Kidder 's active program trading and its wooing of individual investors .
There 's a similar split at Merrill Lynch & Co. , the Big Board 's 3rd-biggest program-trading firm .
Although a Merrill spokesman stressed the firm does program trading only for clients -- `` These are our clients and we have a responsibility to them '' -- the argument does n't go over on the firm 's front lines .
Program trading is `` scaring small investors away , '' said Michael Keyes , a Merrill broker in Ogden , Utah .
The New York Stock Exchange insists it remains sympathetic to the individual investor .
Richard Grasso , Big Board president , said `` it 's too early to reflect on the comments '' made this week by Kemper and the other program-bashing firms .
But , `` we value our relationships with those
who use the marketplace and are certainly sensitive to their needs and desires .
When Kemper cut off four program-trading Wall Street firms from getting any of the big insurance and financial company 's trading business , it complained that the Big Board has `` vested interests '' in its big member securities firms
that engage in program trading .

Chicago businessmen Bertram M. Lee and Peter Bynoe signed a new agreement to purchase the Denver Nuggets basketball team , but not as principal owners .
On Saturday , the partners said the team would be purchased for $ 54 million by a new group including Comsat Video Enterprises Inc. , a unit of Communications Satellite Corp. based here .
Comsat Video will pay $ 17 million for a 62.5 % interest , with Messrs. Lee and Bynoe putting up $ 8 million for a 37.5 % stake in the team .
Under terms of the sale , Nuggets owner Sidney Shlenker could receive up to $ 11 million in additional payments from the franchise 's future earnings .
Messrs. Lee and Bynoe last July announced a deal
that would have made them
the first black principal owners of a major professional sports franchise .
But the deal fell apart last week for lack of financing .
Comsat Video is headed by Robert Wussler , who resigned his No. 2 executive post with Turner Broadcasting System Inc. just two weeks ago to take the Comsat position .
Comsat Video , which distributes pay-per-view programs to hotel rooms , plans to add Nuggets games to their offerings , as Mr. Turner did successfully with his Atlanta Hawks and Braves sports teams .
Messrs. Lee and Bynoe will manage the Nuggets ' day-today affairs .
Four workers at GTE Corp. 's headquarters have been diagnosed as having hepatitis , and city health officials are investigating whether a cafeteria worker may have exposed hundreds of other GTE employees to the viral infection , company and city officials said .
The four cases were all reported to GTE 's medical director and state and local health authorities .
GTE shut down its cafeteria Tuesday afternoon after testing determined that at least one cafeteria worker employed by GTE 's private food vending contractor , ARA Services Inc. , was suffering from a strain of the virus , officials said .
More than 700 people work in the GTE building .
The cafeteria remains closed .
Dr. Andrew McBride , city health director , said his staff suspects the hepatitis , which can be highly contagious , was spread by the cafeteria worker with the virus .
The exact strain of hepatitis that the cafeteria worker contracted has n't been determined but should be known by the end of the week , Dr. McBride said .
Hepatitis
A , considered the least dangerous strain of the virus , has been confirmed in at least one GTE employee , company and city officials said .
`` From a public health point of view
we 're relieved because hepatitis
A is rarely life-threatening , '' said Dr. Frank Provato , GTE 's medical director .
`` It 's a double-edged sword though , because it is also the most contagious kind of hepatitis .
GTE officials began posting warning notices about the potential threat to exposure Wednesday morning at various places at the company , said GTE spokesman Thomas Mattausch .
The company has begun offering shots of gamma globulin , which will diminish the flu-like symptoms of hepatitis
A , in anyone
who has contracted the disease , Mr. Mattausch said .
`` We 're strongly recommending that anyone
who has eaten in the cafeteria
this month have the shot , '' Mr. Mattausch added , `` and that means virtually everyone
who works here .
Genetic Defect Spotted
In 3-Day-Old Embryo
RESEARCHERS diagnosed a genetic defect in a three-day-old mouse embryo in an experiment directly applicable to humans .
Prenatal diagnosis of genetic defects as early as the sixth week of pregnancy is increasingly common today .
But the mouse experiment at a Medical Research Council laboratory in London shows genetic defects can be detected three days after conception using a new American-developed gene-copying technique .
The experiment , applicable to many genetic disorders , involved beta-thalassemia , a severe blood anemia resulting from a missing hemoglobin gene .
It 's an inherited human disorder
that 's been duplicated in mice .
In the experiment , mice with the defective gene were mated .
Three days later , before the new embryo had become implanted in the uterus , it was washed out of the mother mouse .
The embryo had progressed only to a clump of eight identical cells .
One cell was teased out , and its DNA extracted .
Using the new technique developed by Cetus Corp. , called the polymerase chain reaction , the scientists rapidly made millions of copies of the section of DNA
that ordinarily contains the hemoglobin gene , providing enough copies to test .
A genetic probe showed the hemoglobin gene was missing , the researchers report in the medical journal Lancet .
In the report , two molecular biologists suggest such embryo diagnosis can be used by couples at high risk of passing a genetic defect to a child .
For example , infertile couples
who have the woman 's eggs fertilized in the test tube usually have several eggs fertilized at a time .
When the fertilized cells divide to eight cells , a single cell from each embryo can be tested for genetic defects .
A healthy embryo can be picked for implantation and defective ones discarded .
Or in other couples , the embryo could be temporarily taken out and tested three days after conception and returned if healthy , or discarded if not .
Yeast Adapted to Make
Gene-Spliced Drugs
AN OIL COMPANY finds a sideline in the microscopic world of yeast .
In the early 1970s , when the `` world food crisis '' was a major worry , Phillips Petroleum Co. , like several other big companies , began developing `` single-cell protein , '' edible protein made by microbes feeding on non-edible materials .
Phillips found and improved a yeast , `` Pichia pastoris , '' which made protein from natural gas-derived alcohol .
It also could convert glucose from farm wastes into edible protein .
Single-cell protein never panned out , and most companies abandoned such research .
But Phillips persisted , calling in scientists from the Salk Institute .
They 've now adapted the yeast to making genetically engineered drugs .
Like the bacteria used by genetic engineers , the yeast can take in human genes and churn out human proteins for medical use .
But the yeast genetic apparatus is more like that of animals than the bacterial genetic apparatus .
Thus , the proteins from the yeast are molecularly more like human proteins than those from bacteria .
The oil company claims its yeast system also is better than bacteria at high-volume production of genetically engineered drugs .
Chiron Corp. , an Emeryville , Calif. , biotechnology firm , is seeing if the Phillips yeast can be used to make its genetically engineered human proteins .
Peeking Inside Arteries
From Outside the Body
VISUALIZING BLOOD vessels without poking catheters into the body may come out of research at AT&T Bell Laboratories .
Strokes , heart attacks , leg pains ( intermittent claudication ) and other problems stem from clogging of the arteries by cholesterol-rich deposits .
At present , doctors can see how badly an artery is clogged only by inserting a thin catheter into the artery and injecting a fluid
that makes the arteries visible on X-rays .
A non-invasive method is being researched by biophysicist Lynn Jelinski at the AT&T unit .
It relies on the fact that certain atoms give off detectable signals when subjected to an intense magnetic field .
It 's the same phenomenon used in the new MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ) scanners being used in hospitals in place of X-ray scans .
In the Bell Labs experiments , an MRI-type of machine , synchronized with the heartbeat via an electrocardiogram , rapidly flashes a magnetic field on and off as blood passes a certain point in a vessel .
The rapidly flashing return signals from excited hydrogen atoms in the blood give a `` stop-motion '' movie of the blood-filled vessel , ( like the `` stop-motion '' seen in disco dancers when a strobe light is flashing ) .
The scientists have experimented on the tiny neck arteries of rats .
They 've been able to measure the minuscule movements of the artery wall as the beating heart raises and lowers the pressure of the flowing blood , a first for such tiny blood vessels , they report in Nature , a scientific journal .
They now are experimenting with measuring blood flow .
The ultimate hope is that the technique could identify diseased vessels .

Western Digital Corp. reported a net loss of $ 2.7 million , or nine cents
a share , for its first quarter ended Sept. 30 , citing factors as varied as hurricane damage , an advance in graphics technology and the strengthening dollar .
In the year-ago period , the company earned $ 12.9 million , or 45 cents
a share , on sales of $ 247 million .
Sales for the just-ended period fell to about $ 225 million , the maker of computer parts said .
Nonetheless , Chairman Roger W. Johnson said he expects the company to be profitable in the current quarter .
`` We are positioned to come through , '' he said , noting that the company 's backlog was up from the previous quarter .
In its second quarter last year , Western Digital earned $ 12.7 million , or 44 cents
a share , on sales of $ 258.4 million .
Mr. Johnson said Western Digital 's plant in Puerto Rico was affected by Hurricane Hugo , losing three days ' production because of the storm , which wrecked much of the Caribbean island 's infrastructure .
Although the plant
itself
was n't damaged , Mr. Johnson said millions of dollars in first-quarter revenue were lost .
The revenue will be regained in the current period , he added .
There are no plans to initiate a common stock dividend , Mr. Johnson said , explaining that the board continues to believe shareholders are best served by reinvesting excess cash .
Mr. Johnson said the first-quarter loss also heavily reflected a rapid change in graphics technology
that left reseller channels with too many of the old computer graphics boards and too few new monitors compatible with the new graphics boards .
Western Digital does n't make the monitors .
An accelerating move by personal computer manufacturers ' to include advanced graphics capabilities as standard equipment further dampened reseller purchases of Western Digital 's equipment .
`` The other areas of the business -- storage and microcomputers -- were very good , '' Mr. Johnson said .
He said Western Digital has reacted swiftly to the movement to video graphics array , VGA , graphics technology from the old enhanced graphics adapter , EGA , which has a lower resolution standard , technology and now is one of the leading producers of these newer units .
Other makers of video controller equipment also were caught in the EGA-VGA shift , he said , `` but we were able to respond much more quickly .
Still , Mr. Johnson said , `` our stock is grossly undervalued .
'' He said the company has cut operating expenses by about 10 % over the last few quarters , while maintaining research and development at about 8 % to 9 % of sales .
As part of its reorganization
this week , Western Digital has divided its business into two segments -- storage products , including controllers and disk drives ; and microcomputer products , which include graphics , communications and peripheral control chips .
Graphics , communications and peripheral control chips were combined because , increasingly , multiple functions are being governed by a single chip .
Storage , which includes computer controllers and 3.5-inch disk drives , represents nearly two-thirds of the company 's business .
Disk drives , which allow a computer to access its memory , generated 38 % more revenue in the most recent period compared with the fiscal first quarter
Computer parts are getting ever smaller , Mr. Johnson said , a shrinking
that has propelled laptops into position as the fastest-growing segment of the computer business .
As smaller and more powerful computers continue to be the focus of the industry , he said , Western Digital is strengthening development of laptop parts .
Next year Western Digital plans to consolidate its operations from 11 buildings in Irvine into two buildings in the same city a new headquarters and , a block away , a modern $ 100 million silicon wafer fabrication plant .
The plan will help the company in its existing joint manufacturing agreement with AT&T .
About half of Western Digital 's business is overseas , and Mr. Johnson expects that proportion to continue .
Plans to dissolve many of the trade barriers within Europe in 1992 creates significant opportunities for the company , he said , particularly since Western Digital already manufactures there .
Capitalizing on that presence , Western Digital is launching a major effort to develop the embryonic reseller market in Europe .
World sugar futures prices soared on rumors that Brazil , a major grower and exporter , might not ship sugar
this crop year and next .
Prices also were boosted by another rumor that Mexico , usually a large producer and exporter , might have to buy a large quantity of sugar .
Although traders rushed to buy futures contracts , many remained skeptical about the Brazilian development , which could n't be confirmed , analysts said .
The March and May contracts rose to fresh life-of-contract highs of 14.54 cents and 14.28 cents at their best levels of the day .
The March delivery , which has no limits , settled at 14.53 cents , up 0.56 cent
a pound .
The May contract , which also is without restraints , ended with a gain of 0.54 cent to 14.26 cents .
The July delivery rose its daily permissible limit of 0.50 cent
a pound to 14.00 cents , while other contract months showed near-limit advances .
According to reports carried by various news services , the Brazilian government told its sugar producers that they wo n't be allowed to export sugar during the current 1989-90 season , which began May 1 , and the 1990-91 season so that it can be used to produce alcohol for automobile fuel .
One analyst , Arthur Stevenson , of Prudential-Bache Securities , New York , estimated that 65 % or more of Brazil 's newly made automobiles run on alcohol and ca n't use gasoline .
`` This is a demand
that must be met , regardless of the price of oil , '' said Mr. Stevenson .
Brazil is the third-largest producer and the fifth-largest exporter of sugar in the world .
A shift to producing more alcohol and less sugar had been expected , but the latest news , if true , indicates a more drastic shift than had been anticipated .
During the current crop year , Brazil was expected to produce 6.9 million tons of sugar , a drop from 8.1 million tons in 1988-89 .
Its 1989-90 exports were expected to total 645,000 tons in contrast to shipments of 1.5 million tons in
`` It is these 645,000 tons
that are in question for this crop year , '' explained Judith Ganes , analyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton , New York .
`` Producers were granted the right earlier this year to ship sugar and the export licenses were expected to have begun to be issued '' yesterday .
As a result , Ms. Ganes said , it is believed that little or no sugar from the 1989-90 crop has been shipped yet , even though the crop year is six months old .
More than a half of all sugar produced in Brazil goes for alcohol production , according to Ms. Ganes .
Also , there has been a switch in the past decade to planting of orange trees in areas
that were previously used for cane , and this change is being felt now , she said .
Most important , Ms. Ganes noted , `` Brazilian officials said that no decision has as yet been made on the suspension of exports .
Thomas Oxnard , sugar analyst for PaineWebber in Hackensack , N.J. , said : `` I am highly skeptical that Brazil will curtail sugar exports , particularly with the price of sugar at over 14 cents
Above all , Mr. Oxnard noted , the situation is extremely confused .
`` Professional sugar people here who have strong contacts with the Brazilian sugar industry have been unable to confirm the reports or get enough information to clarify the situation , '' he said .
`` It 's the type of nervous atmosphere in which
a report can be put out , such as the one saying exports will be suspended , and no one can confirm it .
Mr. Oxnard observed that the situation in Brazil is also very complicated .
On the one hand , Brazil started an ethanol program about 15 years ago to fuel a huge portion of its national fleet of cars and is now committed to this program .
`` It has to weigh , on the other hand , the relatively high price of sugar
it can earn on the export market in making decisions as to whether to produce sugar or alcohol , '' Mr. Oxnard said .
Mexico , which is normally a sugar exporter , has had production problems in the past two years , analysts said .
Last year , it had to buy sugar on the world market to meet export commitments , they noted .
This year
it is expected to be a net importer and is said to be seeking to buy about 200,000 tons of sugar to meet internal needs , analysts said .
ENERGY : Petroleum futures were generally higher with heating oil leading the way .
On the New York Mercantile Exchange , heating oil for December delivery increased 1.25 cents to settle at 60.36 cents
a gallon .
Gasoline futures were mixed to unchanged .
But the strength in heating oil helped push up crude oil .
West Texas Intermediate crude for December delivery rose 13 cents
a barrel to settle at $ 20.07 .
The firmness in heating oil was attributed to colder weather in parts of the U.S. and to the latest weekly report by the American Petroleum Institute , which showed a decline in inventories of the fuel .
GRAINS AND SOYBEANS : Prices closed mostly higher in relatively light trading as farmers continued to withhold their crops from the marketplace in the hope of higher prices to come .
Trading was muted in part because of the observance of All Saints ' Day across much of Europe .
Continued export demand also supported prices .
As an indicator of the tight grain supply situation in the U.S. , market analysts said that late Tuesday
the Chinese government , which often buys U.S. grains in quantity , turned instead to Britain to buy 500,000 metric tons of wheat .
Traders said prices also were supported by widespread rumors that the Soviet Union is on the verge of receiving most favored nation status from the U.S .
That designation would , among other things , provide more generous credit terms under which
the Soviets could purchase grain .
The Soviets are widely believed to need additional supplies , despite running up record one-month purchases of 310 million bushels of corn in October .
COPPER : Futures prices rose , extending Tuesday 's gains .
The December contract advanced 2.50 cents
a pound to $ 1.1650 .
Buying for the most part carried over from the previous session , and traders apparently ignored reports that a Chilean mine strike may have ended almost before it began , an analyst said .
According to news service reports , most workers at the Disputado mines owned by Exxon Corp. agreed to a new two-year wage contract
that includes a 5 % increase and other benefits .
However , some workers have n't yet accepted the new contract and are continuing negotiations , the analyst said .
Separately , Reuter reported that the Papua-New Guinea government urged its Parliament to extend a state of emergency in copper-rich Bougainville Island for two months .
The Bougainville copper mine has been inoperative since May 15 because of attacks by native landowners
who want Bougainville to secede from Papua-New Guinea .
Ratners Group PLC 's U.S. subsidiary has agreed to acquire jewelry retailer Weisfield 's Inc. for $ 50
a share , or about $ 55 million .
Weisfield 's shares soared on the announcement yesterday , closing up $ 11 to close at $ 50 in national over-the-counter trading .
Ratners and Weisfield 's said they reached an agreement in principle for the acquisition of Weisfield 's by Sterling Inc .
The companies said the acquisition is subject to a definitive agreement .
They said they expect the transaction to be completed by Dec. 15 .
Weisfield 's , based in Seattle , Wash. , currently operates 87 specialty jewelry stores in nine states .
In the fiscal year ended Jan. 31 , the company reported sales of $ 59.5 million and pretax profit of $ 2.9 million .
Ratners , which controls 25 % of the British jewelry market , would increase the number of its U.S. stores to about 450 stores from 360 .
It has said it hopes to control 5 % of jewelry business in the U.S. by 1992 ; currently it controls about 2 % .
Aetna Life & Casualty Co. 's third-quarter net income fell 22 % to $ 182.6 million , or $ 1.63
a share , reflecting the damages from Hurricane Hugo and lower results for some of the company 's major divisions .
Catastrophe losses reduced Aetna 's net income by $ 50 million , including $ 36 million from Hugo .
Last year catastrophe losses totaled $ 5 million , when net was $ 235.5 million , or $ 2.07
The year-earlier results have been restated to reflect an accounting change .
The insurer has started processing claims from the Northern California earthquake nearly two weeks ago .
But because these claims are more difficult to evaluate and have been coming in more slowly , the company has no estimate of the impact of the earthquake on fourth-quarter results .
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday , Aetna closed at $ 60 , down 50 cents .
In the latest quarter , Aetna had a $ 23 million loss on its auto\/homeowners line , compared with earnings of $ 33 million last year .
Profit for its commercial insurance division fell 30 % to $ 59 million , reflecting higher catastrophe losses and the price war in the property\/casualty market for nearly three years .
However , Aetna 's employee benefits division , which includes its group health insurance operations , posted a 34 % profit gain to $ 106 million .
Third-quarter results included net realized capital gains of $ 48 million , which included $ 27 million from the sale of Federated Investors in August and a $ 15 million tax credit .
In the nine months , net rose 4.3 % to $ 525.8 million or $ 4.67
a share , from $ 504.2 million , or $ 4.41
a share , last year .
Yields on certificates of deposit at major banks were little changed in the latest week .
The average yield on six-month CDs of $ 50,000 and less slipped to 7.96 % from 8.00 % , according to Banxquote Money Markets , an information service based here .
On one-year CDs of $ 50,000 and less , the average slid to 8.02 % from 8.06 % .
issues are among the most popular with individual investors .
`` Because of shrinkage in the economy , rates can be expected to decline over a one-year horizon , '' said Norberto Mehl , chairman of Banxquote .
`` It 's unclear how much rates can fall and how soon .
Changes in CD yields in the week ended Tuesday were in line with blips up and down within a fairly narrow range for the last two months .
Interest rates generally began declining last spring after moving steadily upward for more than a year .
The average yield on small-denomination three-month CDs moved up two-hundredths of a percentage point in the latest week to 7.85 % .
Long-term CDs declined just a fraction .
The average yield on both two-year CDs and five-year CDs was 7.98 % .
Only CDs sold by major brokerage firms posted significant increases in average yields in the latest week , reflecting increased yields on Treasury bills sold at Monday 's auction .
The average yield on six-month broker-sold CDs rose to 8.29 % from 8.05 % and on one-year CDs
the average yield rose to 8.30 % from 8.09 % .
The brokerage firms , which negotiate rates with the banks and thrifts whose
CDs they sell , generally feel they have to offer clients more than they can get on T-bills or from banks and thrifts directly .
T-bills sold at Monday 's auction yielded 7.90 % for six months and 7.77 % for three months , up from 7.82 % and 7.61 % , respectively , the week before .
So-called jumbo CDs , typically in denominations of $ 90,000 and up , also usually follow T-bills and interest rate trends in general more than those aimed at small investors .
Some jumbos posted fractional changes in average yields
this week , both up and down .
The average yield on threemonth jumbos rose to 8.00 % from 7.96 % , while the two-year average fell by the same amount to 7.89 % .
Six-month and oneyear yields were unchanged , on average .
`` The ( CD ) market is unsettled right now , '' said Banxquote 's Mr. Mehl .
`` It 's very easily influenced by changes in the stock market and the junk bond market .
The small changes in averages reflect generally unchanged yields at many major banks .
Some , however , lowered yields significantly .
At Chase Manhattan Bank in New York , for example , the yield on a small denomination six-month CD fell about a quarter of a percentage point to 8.06 % .
In California , Bank of America dropped the yield on both six-month and one-year `` savings '' CDs to 8.33 % from 8.61 % .
Yields on money-market deposits were unchanged at an average 6.96 % for $ 50,000 and less and down just a hundredth of a percentage point to 7.41 % for jumbo deposits .
General Motors Corp. 's GMC Truck division put a $ 750 cash incentive on its 1990 full-sized Jimmy and Suburban trucks .
The program , which runs through Jan. 4 , also offers low-rate financing in lieu of the cash rebate .
Canadian production of market pulp rose 1 % in September from a year earlier as the industry operated at 87 % of capacity .
The Canadian Pulp and Paper Association , an industry group , said Canadian mills produced 532,000 metric tons of market pulp in September , compared with 527,000 metric tons
Market pulp is wood pulp sold on the open market to producers of paper and other products .
The statistics exclude pulp consumed at the producing mill or shipped to another mill
that is affiliated with the producing mill .
Canada is the world 's largest producer of market pulp .
The September 87 % operating rate compared with a rate of 101 % in August but was unchanged from a year earlier .
In the first nine months of this year output was 5,377,000 metric tons , down from 5,441,000 metric tons
a year earlier .
General Electric Co. 's rail-car leasing unit completed the $ 178.5 million purchase of similar businesses from Leucadia National Corp. and Brae Corp. , 74%-owned by Leucadia , the sellers said .
The buyer was GE Capital Railcar Services , Chicago , a major owner of railway equipment and part of the GE Capital operations .
Leucadia , New York , estimated it had a pre-tax gain on the transaction of $ 57 million , including its part of Brae 's gain .
Because of tax-loss carry-forward , Leucadia said it expects to escape taxes on `` a substantial portion of the gain .
The estimated gain for Brae is $ 15 million , including a tax credit of $ 7 million , the sellers said .
`` The credit for income taxes is a result of having provided deferred income taxes applicable to the sold assets at the higher income tax rates in effect in prior years , '' the sellers said .
Many thanks for Alexander Cockburn 's comic masterpiece ( `` U.S .
Economy : A House Built on Junk-Bond Sand , '' Viewpoint , Oct. 19 ) .
The use of the abominable construction practices in the Soviet Union -- as evidenced by the collapse of sand apartment blocks during the Armenian earthquake -- as a metaphor for the U.S. economic system was a sublime example of Mr. Cockburn 's satirical muse .
I await his sequel : the economic and social resiliency of the San Francisco Bay area and the outstanding work of the local governments and the private charitable organizations there as metaphors for the supremacy of whatever failed system Mr. Cockburn now believes in .
It should be a scream .

Los
Angeles
Times Mirror Co. said third-quarter net income fell 13 % to $ 70.1 million , or 54 cents
a share , compared with net income of $ 81 million , or 62 cents
The Los Angeles media concern said that the year-ago period included a $ 26.5 million gain from the sale of assets , primarily timberlands .
Revenue was $ 873.9 million , up 7.3 % from $ 814.8 million .
Stronger results from the company 's broadcast and cable television units and professional and textbook publishing divisions , plus increased advertising at the company 's largest newspaper , the Los Angeles Times , offset advertising declines in the company 's newspapers in the Eastern U.S. , the company said .
`` Looking ahead to the fourth quarter , the outlook for the newspaper group remains guarded , with no improvement yet seen in operating trends in our Eastern markets , '' said Robert F. Erburu , Times Mirror 's chairman and chief executive .
First of America Bank Corp. said it completed its acquisition of Midwest Financial Group Inc. for about $ 250 million .
First of America , which now has 45 banks and $ 12.5 billion in assets , announced an agreement to acquire the Peoria , Ill. , bank holding company in January .
Midwest Financial has $ 2.3 billion in assets and eight banks .
The Midwest Financial subsidiary banks will continue to operate under their current names until early 1990 , when each will adopt the First of America name .
Kalamazoo , Mich.-based First of America said it will eliminate the 13 management positions of the former Midwest Financial parent company .
First of America said some of the managers will take other jobs with First of America .
But it said that severance payments to those executives not staying with the company will reduce First of America 's operating results for 1989 by $ 3 million to $ 4 million , or 15 cents to 20 cents
a share .
On the hungry streets of Naguib Mahfouz 's Cairo , life is nasty , brutish and wickedly entertaining .
Zaita
the `` cripple-maker '' rearranges the limbs of aspiring beggars -- and takes a cut of every cent
they cadge .
Hassan Kamel Ali is a card shark and dope dealer
who has a simple creed : `` I live in this world , assuming that there is no morality , God or police .
'' For the killer and thief , Said Mahran , fame flows from the barrel of a gun .
`` One man said you act as a stimulant , '' a prostitute tells him , `` a diversion to relieve people 's boredom .
Mr. Mahfouz 's Cairo also has Sufi sheiks and saintly wives
who look to God , not crime , for their salvation .
But it is his portrait of Cairo low-life -- of charlatans and opium addicts , of streets filled with `` dust , vegetable litter , and animal dung '' -- that made his reputation , and won him
the Nobel Prize in 1988 .
Three novels , `` The Beginning and the End '' ( 412 pages , $ 19.95 ) , `` The Thief and the Dogs '' ( 158 pages , $ 16.95 ) , and `` Wedding Song '' ( 174 pages , $ 16.95 ) , recently published by Doubleday offer an uneven sample of the 77-year-old Mr. Mahfouz 's talent .
But they do show the range of a restless intellect
whose
30-odd novels span five decades and include work of social realism , protest and allegory .
They also chart the evolution of a city
that has grown tenfold in the author 's lifetime , from a colonial outpost of fez-wearing pashas to a Third World slum choking on its own refuse .
`` Soon it 'll be so crowded , '' a narrator complains , `` that people will start eating each other .
`` The Beginning and the End , '' easily the best of the three , belongs to Mr. Mahfouz 's `` realistic '' period and it is the one for which
he is most renowned .
Published in 1949 , it follows the decline of a Cairo family with the saga-like sweep and rich detail that critics often compare to Dickens , Balzac and Galsworthy .
A minor bureaucrat dies suddenly , dooming his family to poverty and eventual disgrace .
His daughter turns to dressmaking , then to peddling herself for a few piasters .
One son sacrifices his own career so that his avaricious brother can succeed , while another helps support the family with money siphoned from crime .
The real tragedy , though , lies not in the family 's circumstances but in its concern for appearances .
Mourning for the father is overshadowed by the shame of burying him in a pauper 's grave .
The family moves to another house at night to conceal shabby belongings from neighbors .
And the successful son wishes his embarrassing siblings dead .
As a critique of middle-class mores , the story is heavy-handed .
But its unsentimental sketches of Cairo life are vintage Mahfouz .
We see , smell and hear slums filled with `` the echoes of hawkers advertising their wares interspersed with abusive language , rattling coughs and the sound of people gathering spittle in their throats and spewing into the street .
'' And we meet engaging crooks , such as Hassan `` the Head , '' famed for his head-butting fights , his whoring and his hashish .
`` ` God has not yet ordained that I should have earnings , ' he tells his worried mother . ''
Hassan comes to a bad end , but so does almost everyone else in the book .
If the setting is exotic , the prose is closer to Balzac 's `` Pere Goriot '' than it is to `` Arabian Nights .
'' Mr. Mahfouz began writing when there was no novelistic tradition in Arabic , and he modeled his work on Western classics .
In one sense , this limits him ; unlike a writer such as Gabriel Garcia Marquez , who has a distinctive Latin voice , Mr. Mahfouz 's style offers little that can be labeled `` Egyptian .
'' But the familiarity of his style also makes his work accessible , as the streets of Cairo come alive for the Western reader as vividly as Dickens 's London or Dostoevski 's St. Petersburg .
`` The Thief and the Dogs , '' written in 1961 , is a taut , psychological drama , reminiscent of `` Crime and Punishment .
'' Its antihero , Said Mahran , is an Egyptian Raskolnikov
who seeks nobility in robbing and killing .
`` I am the hope and the dream , the redemption of cowards , '' he says in one of many interior monologues .
Later , he recalls the words of his Marxist mentor : `` The people !
Theft !
The holy fire !
Said 's story reflects the souring of socialism under Nasser , whose dictatorial rule replaced the monarchy overthrown in 1952 .
By 1961 , Mr. Mahfouz 's idealism had vanished or become twisted , as it has in Said .
His giddy dream of redeeming a life of `` badly aimed bullets '' by punishing the `` real robbers '' -- the rich `` dogs '' who prey on the poor -- leads only to the death of innocents , and eventually to his own .
Cairo 's spirited squalor also has gone gray .
Here , the city is dark and laden with symbolism : Said has left his jail cell only to enter the larger prison of Cairo society .
While the theme is compelling , the plot and characters are not .
We never care about Said or the `` hypocrites '' he hunts .
`` The Thief and the Dogs '' is a pioneering work , the first stream-of-consciousness novel in Arabic , but it is likely to disappoint Western readers .
The 1981 novel `` Wedding Song '' also is experimental , and another badly aimed bullet .
The story of a playwright 's stage debut unfolds in first-person monologues , in the manner of Faulkner 's `` The Sound and the Fury .
'' But the device obscures more than it illuminates .
Buried in the work is a meditation on the morality of art , and on the struggle for integrity in an unfair world .
But again , the themes get tangled in Mr. Mahfouz 's elliptical storytelling .
The indirectness of his later work reflects both
an appetite for new genres and the hazards of art in the Arab world .
Mr. Mahfouz has been pilloried and censored for questioning Islam and advocating peace with Israel .
Veiling his message has helped him endure .
Art , says the playwright in `` Wedding Song , '' is `` the surrogate for the action that an idealist like me is unable to take .
`` Wedding Song '' gives glimpses of a Cairo
that has become so much harsher since his youth , when , as he once said , `` the poorest person was able to find his daily bread and without great difficulty .
'' The clutter of the 1940s remains , but its color has drained away , and the will to overcome has been defeated .
Cars ca n't move because of overflowing sewers .
Characters complain ceaselessly about food queues , prices and corruption .
And the ubiquitous opium addict is now a cynical and selfish man
who gripes : `` Only government ministers can afford it
these days !
'' Having lost their faith in God , in social reform and in opium , Cairenes are left with nothing but their sense of humor .
Mr. Horwitz is a Journal staff reporter covering the Middle East .
In this era of frantic competition for ad dollars , a lot of revenue-desperate magazines are getting pretty cozy with advertisers -- fawning over them in articles and offering pages of advertorial space .
So can a magazine survive by downright thumbing its nose at major advertisers ?
Garbage magazine , billed as `` The Practical Journal for the Environment , '' is about to find out .
Founded by Brooklyn , N.Y. , publishing entrepreneur Patricia Poore , Garbage made its debut
this fall with the promise to give consumers
the straight scoop on the U.S. waste crisis .
The magazine combines how-to pieces on topics like backyard composting , explanatory essays on such things as what happens after you flush your toilet , and hard-hitting pieces on alleged environmental offenders .
Garbage editors have dumped considerable energy into a whirling rampage through supermarket aisles in a bid to identify corporate America 's good guys and bad boys .
In one feature , called `` In the Dumpster , '' editors point out a product
they deem to be a particularly bad offender .
From an advertising standpoint , the problem is these offenders are likely to be some of the same folks
that are major magazine advertisers these days .
With only two issues under its belt , Garbage has alienated some would-be advertisers and raised the ire of others .
Campbell Soup , for one , is furious its Souper Combo microwave product was chastised in the premiere `` In the Dumpster '' column .
The magazine 's editors ran a giant diagram of the product with arrows pointing to the packaging
's polystyrene foam , polyproplene and polyester film -- all plastic items they say are non-biodegradable .
`` It 's precisely the kind of product
that 's created the municipal landfill monster , '' the editors wrote .
`` I think that this magazine is not only called Garbage , but it is practicing journalistic garbage , '' fumes a spokesman for Campbell Soup .
He says Campbell was n't even contacted by the magazine for the opportunity to comment .
Modifications had been made to the Souper Combo product at the time
the issue was printed , he says , making it less an offender than was portrayed .
He admits , though , it is n't one of Campbell Soup 's better products in terms of recyclability .
Campbell Soup , not surprisingly , does n't have any plans to advertise in the magazine , according to its spokesman .
Some media experts question whether a young magazine can risk turning off Madison Avenue 's big spenders .
`` You really need the Campbell Soups of the world to be interested in your magazine if you 're going to make a run of it , '' says Mike White , senior vice president and media director at DDB Needham , Chicago .
`` The economics of magazine publishing pretty much require that you have a pretty solid base '' of big-time ad spenders , he adds .
The first two issues featured ads from only a handful of big advertisers , including General Electric and Adolph Coors , but the majority were from companies like Waste Management Inc. and Bumkins International , firms
that do n't spend much money advertising and ca n't be relied on to support a magazine over the long haul .
A Waste Management spokeswoman says its ad in the premiere issue was a one-time purchase , and it does n't have any plans to advertise in future issues .
`` We do n't spend much on print advertising , '' she says .
But Ms. Poore , the magazine 's editor and publisher , contends Garbage can survive , at least initially , on subscription revenues .
Individual copies of the magazine sell for $ 2.95 and yearly subscriptions cost $ 21 .
( It is , of course , printed on recycled paper .
According to Ms. Poore , Old-House Journal Corp. , her publishing company , printed and sold all 126,000 copies of the premiere issue .
The first and second issues sold out on newsstands , she says , and the magazine has orders for 93,000 subscriptions .
Asked whether potential advertisers will be scared away by the magazine 's direct policy , Ms. Poore replies : `` I do n't know and I do n't care .
I 'm not saying advertising revenue is n't important , '' she says , `` but I could n't sleep at night '' if the magazine bowed to a company because they once took out an ad .
INTERPUBLIC ON TV : Interpublic Group said its television programming operations -- which it expanded earlier this year -- agreed to supply more than 4,000 hours of original programming across Europe in 1990 .
It said the programs , largely game shows , will be provided by its E.C. Television unit along with Fremantle International , a producer and distributor of game shows of which
it recently bought 49 % .
It said that volume makes it
the largest supplier of original TV programming in Europe .
Interpublic is providing the programming in return for advertising time , which
it said will be valued at more than $ 75 million in 1990 and $ 150 million in 1991 .
It plans to sell the ad time to its clients at a discount .
NEW ACCOUNT : CoreStates Financial Corp. , Philadelphia , named Earle Palmer Brown & Spiro , Philadelphia , as agency of record for its $ 5 million account .
The business had been handled by VanSant Dugdale , Baltimore .
AT&T FAX : American Telephone & Telegraph 's General Business Systems division , New York , awarded the ad account for its Fax product line to Ogilvy & Mather , New York , a WPP Group agency .
Billings were n't disclosed for the small account , which had been serviced at Young & Rubicam , New York .
FIRST CAMPAIGN : Enterprise Rent-A-Car Inc. breaks its first national ad campaign
The St. Louis firm specializes in replacement-car rentals , those provided by insurance companies for cars damaged in accidents .
Developed by Avrett , Free & Ginsberg , New York , the $ 6 million campaign pitches Enterprise 's consumer-driven service and its free pick-up and drop-off service .
LANDOR ASSOCIATES : Young & Rubicam said it completed its acquisition of Landor Associates , a San Francisco identity-management firm .
ACQUISITION : Ketchum Communications , Pittsburgh , acquired Braun & Co. , a Los Angeles investor-relations and marketing-communications firm .

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said it will start enforcing stiffer regulations Jan. 31 for so-called gray-market imports of vehicles .
The regulations , required under legislation enacted by Congress last year , will apply to imports of vehicles
that were n't built to meet U.S. government auto safety standards and were intended for use in Europe or elsewhere abroad .
U.S. officials estimated that gray-market imports total about 2,100 units
a year , a small part of the more than three million vehicles exported to the U.S.
each year .
According to the NHTSA , the new regulations will prohibit anyone other than an importer
that has registered with the U.S. government , or a person
who has a contract with a registered importer , from permanently importing a vehicle
that does n't meet the U.S. auto safety standards .
The registered importer would be required to bring such vehicles into compliance with the U.S. safety standards , compared with the current situation in which
anyone can bring in such vehicles and modify them to meet the U.S. standards .
Congress tightened auto safety standards for gray-market imports after U.S. auto dealers , including franchised foreign-car dealers , complained that they often were blamed when the second and third buyers of such vehicles found that the cars could n't meet U.S. auto safety standards .
French consumer prices rose 0.2 % in September from August , according to provisional estimates by the National Statistics Institute .
The agency noted that because of a strike by Finance Ministry personnel
the provisional estimate does n't correspond exactly to the consumer price index usually published .
The agency noted , however , the estimate will likely be confirmed .
The institute did n't estimate annual price growth in September , but a 0.2 % rise by the consumer price index would put growth at either
178.8 or 178.9 , up 3.3 % or 3.4 % from the year-earlier level of 173.1 .
The index was 178.5 in August and is based on 1980 equaling 100 .
Investors celebrated the second anniversary of Black Monday with a buying spree in both
stocks and bonds .
But the dollar was mixed .
Stock and bond investors were cheered by last month 's encouragingly low inflation rate .
This news raised hopes for further interest-rate cuts .
Treasury-bond prices immediately rallied , setting the stock market rolling from the opening bell .
The Dow Jones Industrial Average , up about 60 points in mid-afternoon , finished with a gain of 39.55 points , to 2683.20 .
That brought the average 's cumulative gain
this week to about 114 points .
Since the 1987 crash , the industrials have soared more than 54 % , and the widely watched market barometer is about 4 % below its record high set earlier this month .
The stock-market rally was led by blue-chip issues , but , unlike Monday 's rebound , was broadly based .
Indeed , over-the-counter stocks , led by technology issues , outleaped
the industrial average .
The Nasdaq Composite Index soared 7.52 , or 1.6 % , to 470.80 , its highest one-day jump in points
Many takeover-related stocks rose after news that a group obtained financing commitments for the proposed buy-out of American Medical International Inc .
Among the biggest winners were brokerage-house stocks , responding to heavy trading volume .
The government said consumer prices rose only 0.2 % last month .
Economists expected twice as large an increase .
That news , plus recent signs of economic sluggishness , greatly increases pressure on the Federal Reserve to ease credit further , which in turn would be good news for stocks , investment managers say .
`` I see a lot of evidence indicating a slower economy , and that means my interest-rate outlook has a downward tilt , '' said Garnett L. Keith Jr. , vice chairman of Prudential Insurance Co. of America , one of the nation 's largest institutional investors .
Fed officials probably wo n't drive down rates immediately , Mr. Keith said .
Despite the inflation news , several Fed officials still fear consumer-price pressures will intensify because they insist the economy is stronger than generally believed .
But Wall Street analysts expect further signs of economic weakness in government reports during the next few weeks .
If so , that will cinch the case for another shot of credit-easing within a month or so .
That , in turn , is expected to persuade banks to cut their prime lending rate , a benchmark rate on many corporate and consumer loans , by half a percentage point , to 10 % .
`` We 're not out of the woods yet by any means , '' said George R. Mateyo , president and chief executive of Carnegie Capital Management Co. , Cleveland .
But the economy `` is slowing enough to give the Federal Reserve leeway to reduce interest rates .
But many individual investors are leery about stocks because of fresh signs of fragility in the huge junk-bond market .
Investors also are anxious about today 's `` witching hour , '' the monthly expiration of stock-index futures and options , and options on individual stocks .
This phenomenon often makes stock prices swing wildly at the end of the trading session .
Stock prices surged in heavy trading .
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange rose to 198.1 million shares from 166.9 million Wednesday .
Gaining Big Board issues outnumbered decliners by 1,235 to 355 .
The dollar was mixed .
In New York late yesterday , it was at 141.70 yen , up from 141.45 yen late Wednesday .
But it fell to 1.8470 marks from 1.8485 .
Du Pont Co. reported that third-quarter profit grew a robust 19 % from a year ago on the strength of the company 's operations in various chemicals and fibers , and in petroleum .
Du Pont also raised its quarterly dividend to $ 1.20
a share from $ 1.05 , a change
that will increase the annualized payout to shareholders by some $ 140 million .
Du Pont , unlike companies hurt badly by sharp price declines for basic chemicals and plastics , is benefiting from its broad range of businesses .
The profit gain was made despite a weakening in the housing market , for which
the company is a supplier , and a strengthening in the dollar , which lowers the value of overseas earnings when they are translated into dollars .
The Wilmington , Del. , company reported net of $ 547 million , or $ 2.36
a share , which was in line with Wall Street estimates .
In the year-earlier period , the company earned $ 461 million , or $ 1.91
Sales in the latest quarter were $ 8.59 billion , up 9.4 % from $ 7.85 billion .
The dividend increase was Du Pont 's second this year , an affirmation of statements by top executives that they intend to increase rewards to shareholders .
`` We have n't benefited the shareholder as much as we need to , '' said Edgar Woolard Jr. , Du Pont 's chairman and chief executive officer , in an interview several months before he entered his current position in April .
The largest beneficiary will be Seagram Co. , which owns about 23 % of Du Pont .
A spokesman for Seagram , the Montreal wine and spirits concern controlled by the Bronfman family , said the company will post additional pretax profit of about $ 33 million
a year because of the additional Du Pont dividends .
Du Pont also announced plans for a 3-for-1 stock split , although the initial higher dividend will be paid on pre-split shares .
Du Pont 's stock rose $ 2.50
a share to close at $ 117.375 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday .
Seagram closed at $ 84.75 , up 12.5 cents
a share in Big Board trading .
Leading the gains for Du Pont in the latest quarter was its industrial products segment , where profit soared to $ 155 million from $ 99 million
The company benefited from continued strong demand and higher selling prices for titanium dioxide , a white pigment used in paints , paper and plastics .
James Fallon , a New Providence , N.J. , marketing consultant to the chemicals industry , says Du Pont still holds an edge in making the pigment because the company was `` first in with the technology '' to lower costs .
He said Du Pont holds about 23 % of the world-wide market , the largest single share , at a time when growing uses for the pigment have kept it in tight supply , although others are now adding low-cost production capacity .
Profit climbed to $ 98 million from $ 71 million in the petroleum segment , as Du Pont 's Conoco Inc. oil company was helped by crude oil prices higher than a year ago and by higher natural gas prices and volume .
In the diversifed businesses segment , which includes herbicides , profit grew to $ 64 million from $ 27 million .
A spokesman said herbicide use in some areas of the U.S. was delayed earlier in the year by heavy rains , thus increasing sales in the third quarter .
In the fibers segment , profit rose to $ 180 million from $ 155 million , a gain Du Pont attributed to higher demand in the U.S. for most textile products .
Two segments posted lower earnings for the quarter .
Profit from coal fell to $ 41 million from $ 58 million , partly because of a miners ' strike .
And profit from polymers dropped to $ 107 million from $ 122 million amid what
Du Pont called lower demand and selling prices in certain packaging and industrial markets .
For the nine months , Du Pont earned $ 2 billion , or $ 8.46
a share , up 18 % from $ 1.69 billion , or $ 7.03
Sales increased 10 % to $ 26.54 billion from $ 24.05 billion .
The increased dividend will be paid Dec. 14 to holders of record Nov. 15 .
The stock split , which is subject to holder approval , would be paid on a still unspecified date in January to holders of record Dec. 21 .
They did n't play the third game of the World Series on Tuesday night as scheduled , and they did n't play it on Wednesday or Thursday either .
But you knew that , did n't you ?
They are supposed to play the game next Tuesday , in Candlestick Park here .
The theory is that the stadium , damaged by Tuesday 's earthquake , will be repaired by then , and that people will be able to get there .
Like just about everything else , that remains to be seen .
Aftershocks could intervene .
But , at least , the law of averages should have swung to the favorable side .
It may seem trivial to worry about the World Series amid the destruction to the Bay Area wrought by Tuesday 's quake , but the name of this column is `` On Sports , '' so I feel obliged to do so .
You might be interested to know that baseball , not survival , appeared to be the first thought of most of the crowd of 60,000-odd
that had gathered at Candlestick at 5:04 p.m. Tuesday , a half-hour before game time , when the quake struck .
As soon as the tremor passed , many people spontaneously arose and cheered , as though it had been a novel kind of pre-game show .
One fan , seated several rows in front of the open , upper-deck auxiliary press section where I was stationed , faced the assembled newsies and laughingly shouted , `` We arranged that just for you guys !
'' I thought and , I 'm sure , others did : `` You should n't have bothered .
I 'd slept through my only previous brush with natural disaster , a tornado 15 or so summers ago near Traverse City , Mich. , so I was unprepared for one reaction to such things : the urge to talk about them .
Perhaps primed by the daily diet of radio and TV reporters thrusting microphones into people 's faces and asking how they `` feel '' about one calamity or another , fellow reporters and civilians
who spied my press credential were eager to chat .
`` It felt like I was on a station platform and a train went by , '' said one man , describing my own reaction .
A women said she saw the park 's light standards sway .
A man said he saw the upper rim undulate .
I saw neither .
Dictates of good sense to the contrary not withstanding , the general inclination was to believe that the disturbance would be brief and that ball would be played .
`` I was near the top of the stadium , and saw a steel girder bow six feet from where I sat , but I stayed put for 10 or 15 minutes , '' confessed a friend .
`` I guess I thought , ` This is the World Series and I 'm not gon na wimp out !
Here in the Global Village , though , folks do not stay uninformed for long .
Electrical power was out in still-daylighted Candlestick Park , but battery-operated radios and television sets were plentiful .
Within a few minutes , the true extent of the catastrophe was becoming clear .
Its Richter Scale measurement was reported as 6.5 , then 6.9 , then 7.0 .
A section of the Bay Bridge had collapsed , as had a part of Interstate Highway 880 in Oakland .
People had died .
At 5:40 p.m. , scheduled game time having passed , some fans chanted `` Let 's Play Ball .
'' No longer innocent , they qualified as fools .
The stadium was ordered evacuated soon afterward ; the announcement , made over police bullhorns , cited the power outage , but it later was revealed that there also had been damage of the sort reported by my friend .
Outside , I spotted two young men lugging blocks of concrete .
`` Pieces of Candlestick , '' they said .
The crowd remained good natured , even bemused .
TV reporters interviewed fans in the parking lots while , a few feet away , others watched the interviews on their portable TVs .
The only frenzy
I saw was commercial : Booths selling World Series commemorative stamps and dated postmarks were besieged by fledgling speculators
who saw future profit in the items .
The traffic jam out of the park was monumental .
It took me
a half-hour to move 10 feet from my parking spot in an outer lot to an aisle , and an additional hour to reach an inner roadway
a half-block away .
The six-mile trip to my airport hotel
that had taken 20 minutes earlier in the day took more than three hours .
At my hotel , the Westin , power was out , some interior plaster had broken loose and there had been water damage , but little else .
With Garpian randomness , a hotel across the street , the Amfac , had been hit harder : A large sheet of its concrete facade and several window balconies were torn away .
The Westin staff had , kindly , set out lighted candles in the ballroom , prepared a cold-cuts buffet and passed around pillows and blankets .
I fell asleep on the lobby floor , next to a man wearing a Chicago Cubs jacket .
I expected him to say , `` I told you so , '' but he already was snoring .
The journalistic consensus was that the earthquake made the World Series seem unimportant .
My response was that sports rarely are important , only diverting , and the quake merely highlighted that fact .
Should the rest of the Series be played at all ?
Sure .
The quake and baseball were n't related , unlike the massacre of athletes
that attended the 1972 Olympics .
That heavily politicized event learned nothing from the horrifying experience , and seems doomed to repeat it .
Two ironies intrude .
This has been widely dubbed the BART Series , after the local subway line , and the Bay Bridge Series .
Flags fly at half-staff for the death of Bart Giamatti , the late baseball commissioner , and now the Bay Bridge lies in ruins .
A Series
that was shaping up as the dullest since the one-sided Detroit-over-San Diego go of 1984 has become memorable in the least fortunate way .
Still , its edge is lost .
It now will be played mostly for the record , and should be wrapped up as quickly as possible , without `` off '' days .
And I will never again complain about a rainout .
Bank of England Governor Robin Leigh-Pemberton urged banks to be cautious in financing leveraged buy-outs .
`` Caution should ... be the rule of the day , '' said Mr. Leigh-Pemberton in a speech to the Association of Corporate Treasurers ' annual dinner .
`` It would be damaging to industry and to the financial sector in general , to say nothing of banks , if prudence does not guide the financing of leveraged transactions .
His remarks were distributed to the press before Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson announced his resignation last evening .
Bank of England officials said the central bank had no comment on Mr. Lawson 's resignation .
Mr. Leigh-Pemberton reiterated that the exposure of United Kingdom banks to leveraged deals have n't yet reached `` worrying levels .
'' However , in light of the risks involved in such transactions , banks should satisfy themselves that they have the skills to participate in this market and clear policy guidelines on acceptable levels of exposure to such transactions , he said .
In other comments , he said takeovers may not always be the most efficient way of securing a change of corporate direction or strategy .
`` A similar result could sometimes be achieved , at less cost , by changing managements , '' he said .
Since chalk first touched slate , schoolchildren have wanted to know : What 's on the test ?
These days , students can often find the answer in test-coaching workbooks and worksheets their teachers give them in the weeks prior to taking standardized achievement tests .
The mathematics section of the widely used California Achievement Test asks fifth graders : `` What is another name for the Roman numeral IX ?
'' It also asks them to add two-sevenths and three-sevenths .
Worksheets in a test-practice kit called Learning Materials , sold to schools across the country by Macmillan\/McGraw-Hill School Publishing Co. , contain the same questions .
In many other instances , there is almost no difference between the real test and Learning Materials .
What 's more , the test and Learning Materials are both produced by the same company , Macmillan\/McGraw-Hill , a joint venture of McGraw-Hill Inc. and Macmillan 's parent , Britain 's Maxwell Communication Corp .
Close parallels between tests and practice tests are common , some educators and researchers say .
Test-preparation booklets , software and worksheets are a booming publishing subindustry .
But some practice products are so similar to the tests themselves that critics say they represent a form of school-sponsored cheating .
`` If I took {
these preparation booklets } into my classroom , I 'd have a hard time justifying to my students and parents that it was n't cheating , '' says John Kaminski , a Traverse City , Mich. , teacher
who has studied test coaching .
He and other critics say such coaching aids can defeat the purpose of standardized tests , which is to gauge learning progress .
`` It 's as if France decided to give only French history questions to students in a European history class , and when everybody aces the test , they say their kids are good in European history , '' says John Cannell , an Albuquerque , N.M. , psychiatrist and founder of an educational research organization , Friends for Education , which has studied standardized testing .
Standardized achievement tests are given about 10 million times
a year across the country to students generally from kindergarten through eighth grade .
The most widely used of these tests are Macmillan\/McGraw 's CAT and Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills ; the Iowa Test of Basic Skills , by Houghton Mifflin Co. ; and Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc. 's Metropolitan Achievement Test and Stanford Achievement Test .
Sales figures of the test-prep materials are n't known , but their reach into schools is significant .
In Arizona , California , Florida , Louisiana , Maryland , New Jersey , South Carolina and Texas , educators say they are common classroom tools .
Macmillan\/McGraw says `` well over 10 million '' of its Scoring High test-preparation books have been sold since their introduction 10 years ago , with most sales in the last five years .
About 20,000 sets of Learning Materials teachers ' binders have also been sold in the past four years .
The materials in each set reach about 90 students .
Scoring High and Learning Materials are the best-selling preparation tests .
Michael Kean , director of marketing for CTB Macmillan\/McGraw , the Macmillan\/McGraw division
that publishes Learning Materials , says it is n't aimed at improving test scores .
He also asserted that exact questions were n't replicated .
When referred to the questions that matched , he said it was coincidental .
Mr. Kaminski , the schoolteacher , and William Mehrens , a Michigan State University education professor , concluded in a study last June that CAT test versions of Scoring High and Learning Materials should n't be used in the classroom because of their similarity to the actual test .
They devised a 69-point scale -- awarding one point for each subskill measured on the CAT test -- to rate
the closeness of test preparatives to the fifth-grade CAT .
Because many of these subskills -- the symmetry of geometrical figures , metric measurement of volume , or pie and bar graphs , for example -- are only a small part of the total fifth-grade curriculum , Mr. Kaminski says , the preparation kits would n't replicate too many , if their real intent was general instruction or even general familiarization with test procedures .
But Learning Materials matched on 66.5 of 69 subskills .
Scoring High matched on 64.5 .
In CAT sections where students ' knowledge of two-letter consonant sounds is tested , the authors noted that Scoring High concentrated on the same sounds that the test does -- to the exclusion of other sounds that fifth graders should know .
Learning Materials for the fifth-grade contains at least a dozen examples of exact matches or close parallels to test items .
Rick Brownell , senior editor of Scoring High , says that Messrs. Kaminski and Mehrens are ignoring `` the need students have for becoming familiar with tests and testing format .
'' He said authors of Scoring High `` scrupulously avoid '' replicating exact questions , but he does n't deny that some items are similar .
When Scoring High first came out in 1979 , it was a publication of Random House .
McGraw-Hill was outraged .
In a 1985 advisory to educators , McGraw-Hill said Scoring High should n't be used because it represented a `` parallel form '' of the CAT and CTBS tests .
But in 1988 , McGraw-Hill purchased the Random House unit
that publishes Scoring High , which later became part of Macmillan\/McGraw .
Messrs. Brownell and Kean say they are unaware of any efforts by McGraw-Hill to modify or discontinue Scoring High .
Earlier this year , President Bush made a final `` take-it-or-leave it '' offer on the minimum wage : an increase to $ 4.25
an hour over three years , and only if accompanied by a lower wage for the first six months of a job .
Now , the White House has decided to accept the higher wage over only two years .
The sub-minimum wage would apply only to first-time teen-age workers for 90 days .
The White House had enough votes to sustain a veto but chose to avoid a confrontation .
The only permanent losers will be the 200,000 or so workers
everyone agrees will be priced out of a job at the $ 4.25 rate Congress is likely to approve today .
It is compromises such as this
that convince Washington 's liberals that if they simply stay the course , this administration will stray from its own course on this and other issues .
Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady said that Congress should grant the Securities and Exchange Commission
the power to close the stock markets in periods of crisis .
In testimony to the Senate securities subcommittee , Mr. Brady disputed the view of SEC Chairman Richard Breeden , who told a House panel Wednesday that he does n't want the ability to halt the markets .
Mr. Breeden contended that discretionary power could have an impact on the markets if rumors were to circulate about when the exchanges might be closed .
He added that the president already has the power to close the markets in an emergency .
But Mr. Brady argued that the SEC is closer to the markets and in a better position to understand when the exchanges are under such stress that they should be closed .
Separately , Mr. Brady said he asked the Working Group on Financial Markets to determine whether futures margins are too low .
He noted that some minimum margin requirements have been reduced to levels below those before the 1987 crash .
`` This raises questions whether futures and equity margin requirements are consistent at these levels and whether futures margins are adequate , '' Mr. Brady said .
Margins are the amount of money
an investor needs to put up to buy or sell a futures contract .
Margins on the futures exchanges typically are raised and lowered according to market volatility .
The Chicago Mercantile Exchange margins for the Standard & Poor 's 500 stock-index futures stood at $ 10,000
a contract for speculators and $ 5,000 for hedgers before Oct. 16 , 1987 ; that day
the hedging margin was raised to $ 7,500 .
Margins were raised or lowered about a dozen times since the crash Oct. 19 , 1987 .
Currently , they stand at $ 12,000 for speculators , who are typically individuals and non-member traders , and $ 6,000 for hedgers , which are usually institutions and have offsetting positions in the underlying stocks .
Mr. Brady also said he expects the leveraged buy-out phenomenon to `` end under ( its ) own weight .
'' Asked whether there is anything
Congress should do to curb the LBO boom , Mr. Brady responded , `` I think the LBO phenomenon , ( while ) it wo n't stop completely , will be a thing of the past .
'' Before taking any action , he advised the panel to `` see what
the market has produced as a cure .
Mr. Brady also agreed with senators ' concerns about recent stock-market volatility , and said he realizes that the gyrations are scaring investors from investing in stocks .
But he added that individuals still are participating in the equity market indirectly through mutual funds and pension funds .
The former Wall Street executive refused to offer an opinion on the controversy surrounding program trading , which has recently become a larger part of the trading in the market and has been blamed for accelerating the drop two weeks ago .
`` I do not have a view of whether we should do anything about program trading at this time , '' he said .
But Mr. Brady endorsed the market-revision bill that both
houses of Congress will try to push through this session .
That bill , proposed by the SEC last year , would require brokerage firms to disclose the financial positions of their holding companies , mandate large traders ' reporting of program or block trades , and improve clearing and settlement of trades between the futures and stock markets .
The bill also would give the SEC
the power to close the markets , a discretion that former SEC Chairman David Ruder wanted but Mr. Breeden does n't .
Mr. Brady and senators agreed to have their staffs meet within the next week to start fine-tuning the bill .
The stock market 's woes spooked currency traders but prompted a quiet little party among bond investors .
Prices of long-term Treasury bonds moved inversely to the stock market as investors sought safety amid growing evidence
the economy is weakening .
But the shaky economic outlook and the volatile stock market forced the dollar lower against major currencies .
The bond market got an early boost from the opening-hour sell-off in stocks .
That rout was triggered by UAL Corp. 's announcement late Monday that the proposed management-labor buy-out had collapsed .
The 80-point decline in the Dow Jones Industrial Average during the morning trading session touched off a flight to safety
that saw investors shifting assets from stocks to Treasury bonds .
At its strongest , the Treasury 's benchmark 30-year bond rose more than a point , or more than $ 10 for each $ 1,000 face amount .
As the stock market recovered some of its losses later in the day , bond prices retreated .
But analysts said the combination of a second consecutive decline in monthly durable-goods orders and lackluster mid-October auto sales helped prop up the Treasury market .
A slowing economy and the implication of lower inflation and interest rates tend to bolster bond prices .
On the surface , the decline in September durable goods -- only 0.1 % -- did n't appear very weak .
But orders for non-defense capital goods , a precursor of future plant and equipment spending , were off 5.6 % after falling 10.3 % in August .
Auto makers reported that mid-October sales were running at an annual rate of about 5.8 million units , far less than the 6.6 million units analysts had expected .
Taken together , the auto-sales and durable-goods reports confirmed perceptions that the economy is bogging down .
Although analysts do n't expect the Federal Reserve to ease credit policy soon , reports like those yesterday help build the case for lower rates .
Now bond investors are looking toward next week 's report from national purchasing managers and the government 's October employment report as potentially prompting the Fed to lower rates .
The stock market 's precipitous drop frightened foreign investors , who quickly bid the dollar lower .
But as stock prices recovered some of the early losses , so did the U.S. currency .
Although dealers said investors are becoming more bearish toward the dollar in the wake of the stock market 's recent troubles and as the U.S. economy weakens , the dollar ended down only modestly .
Bond prices rose .
The Treasury 's benchmark 30-year bond gained nearly half a point , or about $ 5 for each $ 1,000 face amount .
The yield on the issue slipped to 7.89 % .
The dollar retreated .
In late New York trading the currency was quoted at 1.8355 marks and 141.45 yen , compared with 1.8470 marks and 141.90 yen Monday .
Intelogic Trace Inc. said it is exploring alternatives to maximize shareholder value , including the possible sale of the company .
But Asher B. Edelman , who controls about 16 % of the San Antonio , Texas , computer-servicing company , insisted that the announcement did n't have anything to do with the ongoing battle for control of Datapoint Corp .
Any sale of Intelogic could have an impact on the battle between Mr. Edelman and New York attorney Martin Ackerman for control of Datapoint .
Intelogic holds 27.5 % of Datapoint 's common shares outstanding .
Mr. Edelman said the decision `` has nothing to do with Marty Ackerman .
'' Mr. Ackerman contended that it was a direct response to his efforts to gain control of Datapoint .
Intelogic was spun off from Datapoint four years ago , shortly after Mr. Edelman took control of Datapoint .
Coda Energy Inc. said it arranged a $ 50 million credit facility with NCNB Texas National Bank , a unit of NCNB Corp. , of Charlotte , N.C .
The Dallas oil and gas concern said that $ 10 million of the facility would be used to consolidate the company 's $ 8.1 million of existing bank debt , to repurchase 4 million of its 4.9 million shares outstanding of Series D convertible preferred stock , and to purchase a 10 % net-profits interest in certain oil and gas properties from one of its existing lenders , National Canada Corp .
The remaining $ 40 million can be used over three years for oil and gas acquisitions , the company said .
Ted Eubank , Coda 's president , said the loan carries an interest rate of prime plus one percentage point , with 85 % of the company 's net oil and gas revenue
each month dedicated to repayment .
The company put up `` virtually all '' of its oil and gas properties as collateral , he said .
Stock of United Airlines parent UAL Corp. gyrated wildly yesterday amid speculation that one or more investors may challenge the UAL board 's decision to remain independent instead of pursuing a buy-out or other transaction .
The board 's decision , announced after the market closed Monday , initially prompted a severe sell-off in UAL shares , which at midday traded as low as $ 145
a share , down $ 33
a share , in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange .
The deepening bloodbath for takeover-stock traders , who by then had seen UAL stock tumble 49 % since Oct. 12 , also triggered a marketwide sell-off
that sent the Dow Jones Industrial Average down more than 80 points at 10:40 a.m .
But then steady , concentrated buying by Bear , Stearns & Co. , which frequently buys stock for corporate raiders , took hold and steadied the fall in UAL , which eventually buoyed the entire market .
The industrial average closed down only 3.69 points at 2659.22 .
Late in the afternoon , several big purchases by Bear , Stearns , particularly a block of 200,000 shares at 2:43 p.m. at $ 150
a share , triggered a buying spree
that took UAL up more than 18 points in the final hour of trading .
UAL stock closed at $ 170
a share , down $ 8.375 .
Volume was a tumultuous 4.9 million shares , or 22 % of the 21.8 million UAL shares outstanding .
Traders estimated that Bear , Stearns bought more than 1 million shares .
The two most frequently rumored buyers , neither of whom would comment , were Coniston Partners , which battled the UAL board in 1987 , and New York real estate developer Donald Trump , who recently made and withdrew an offer for American Airlines parent AMR Corp .
However , one person familiar with UAL said the signs pointed to Coniston because Mr. Trump has n't asked for permission to buy more than $ 15 million of stock under federal antitrust rules .
Takeover-stock traders , stung by their huge losses in UAL stock , remained eager for some action by an outside catalyst following the collapse Oct. 13 of a $ 300-a-share , $ 6.79 billion labor-management buy-out .
Their hope was that the catalyst would seek to oust the board in a solicitation of shareholder consents .
Baker , Nye Investments , a New York takeover-stock trader
that owns UAL stock , would n't comment on reports
the firm is considering seeking such a shareholder vote .
But partner Richard Nye said , `` This is the most extraordinary failed transaction
I 've seen in 25 years in this business .
It would make sense for somebody to do it .
I have never seen a case of incompetence shared by so many participants .
In 1986 , Baker , Nye waged a proxy fight for control of Leaseway Transportation Inc.
that ultimately led to Leaseway 's being sold .
Some traders pointed hopefully to earlier estimates by UAL 's investment adviser , First Boston Corp. , that recapitalizations could yield $ 245 to $ 280
But those would require pilots ' cooperation .
Any investor
who acquires UAL stock in an attempt to force a buy-out or recapitalization must deal with United
's contentious unions .
The pilots are working under an expired contract , and the machinists contract expires next month .
That gives them enormous leverage , including the threat of a strike to block any buy-out or recapitalization attempt
they oppose .
However , a catalyst like Coniston could seek shareholder support for a sale to a labor-management group at the last price discussed by that group before the board meeting Monday .
The pilots had been working on a buy-out bid between $ 225 and $ 240
One person familiar with UAL said the unsettled labor situation and the uncertain world-wide financial markets contributed to the board 's decision to avoid `` rushing around selling the company at a bargain price , '' particularly since it accepted a $ 300-a-share offer just last month .
Even some takeover-stock traders said they could n't quarrel with the board 's logic .
But the board 's decision prompted many to bail out of the stock yesterday .
`` We had a lot of people
who threw in the towel today , '' said Earl Ellis , a partner in Benjamin Jacobson & Sons , a specialist in trading UAL stock on the Big Board .
Another trader noted that many arbitrage firms are afraid to sell their UAL stock at the bottom , but already own so much they ca n't buy any more .
`` This deal is like a Roach Motel , '' he said .
`` They check in , but they ca n't check out .
But both
the traders and the pilots remain interested in some transaction .
So too , according to many reports , is British Airways PLC , despite its public withdrawal from the buy-out .
The pilots might end up teaming up with their longtime adversaries , the machinists union , in a recapitalization .
The machinists are reviewing proposals they made in the past for recapitalizations
that would pay a special shareholder dividend and give employees
a minority stake .
The company rejected those past proposals .
It is unclear , however , if the machinists would support a majority stake , as the pilots want .
A machinist official said that would depend on how much in concessions machinists would have to give in return for the majority stake .
Some investors whose names were bandied about by traders as potential UAL stock buyers said they were n't buying .
`` I 'm not interested , '' said Dallas investor Harold Simmons .
A source close to Carl Icahn , a corporate raider
who owns Trans World Airlines Inc. , said he
has n't owned any UAL stock and is n't buying .
One person familiar with Texas billionaire Robert Bass said he is n't likely to make any hostile moves .
And a spokesman for Reliance Group Holdings Inc. , which had held 7 % of UAL before the first buy-out bid but later reduced its holdings below 5 % , would n't comment .
Marvin Davis , whose
$ 5.4 billion takeover bid originally put the nation 's second-largest airline in play , is limited by a standstill agreement with UAL
he signed in September .
The Los Angeles investor ca n't buy UAL stock , solicit shareholder consents or make a new offer unless he makes a formal offer of $ 300
a share or UAL accepts an offer below $ 300 .
However , Mr. Davis could pressure the board by asking that the agreement be waived , or letting it be known that he has financing for an offer at a lower price .
Santa Fe Pacific was the kind of story Wall Street loved .
Since the value of its assets was n't known , analysts were free to pick a number .
In one of many rosy scenarios , Bear Stearns 's Gary Schneider wrote in March that its real estate alone had a value of $ 4.5 billion .
Throw in its railroad , minerals , pipeline and oil assets , he and others argued , and the Chicago-based conglomerate should be worth 30
And why should holders expect to realize that presumed `` worth ?
'' That was another reason
the Street loved Santa Fe .
With real estate experts Olympia & York and Samuel Zell 's Itel owning close to 40 % of Santa Fe 's stock , management was under pressure -- in a favored phrase of Wall Street -- to quickly `` maximize values .
But value , it turns out , is only what
a buyer will pay .
And with the company 's recent announcement that it is contemplating a partial sale of its real estate , the values suddenly look poorer .
Santa Fe has disclosed that it is negotiating to sell a 20 % interest in its real estate unit to the California Public Employees Retirement System for roughly $ 400 million .
Since the real estate unit also includes debt , the imputed value of the real estate
itself is close to $ 3 billion .
`` The implied current net asset value of 22.70 { per share } is well below the 30 level that the Street believed , '' PaineWebber says .
`` The upside was in the intangible real estate ...
which is no longer an intangible .
So what is Santa Fe worth ?
If the railroad is valued on a private market basis -- at the same multiple of earnings as in the recent sale of CNW -- it would have a value of $ 1.65 billion .
A compromise between bulls and bears puts remaining assets and cash -- including its 44 % stake in its publicly traded pipeline -- at $ 2 billion .
Santa Fe also has $ 3.7 billion in debt .
In addition , its railroad lost a $ 750 million antitrust suit , which is on appeal , and which analysts say could be settled for one-third
that amount .
That nets out to about $ 17
a share for the company on a private market basis .
But Santa Fe , currently trading at 18 7\/8 , is n't likely to realize private market values by selling assets , because the tax against it would be onerous .
Its plan , instead , is to spin off the remainder of its real estate unit and to possibly do the same with its mining and energy assets .
Robert D. Krebs , Santa Fe 's chairman , argues that since its businesses are valued in different ways , `` the sum of the parts may be greater than the whole .
But it is n't clear why that should be so .
The spinoff argument , after all , reverses the current notion that assets are worth more to private buyers than to public shareholders .
And real estate usually has n't traded well under public ownership .
Salomon Brothers says , `` We believe the real estate properties would trade at a discount ... after the realty unit is spun off ... .
And what about the cost , and risk , of waiting to realize the hypothetical private market values ?
Some analysts remain bullish .
Mr. Schneider of Bear Stearns says he is recalculating the worth of the company 's assets and , in the meantime , is sticking to his `` buy '' recommendation on the belief that he will find `` values '' of 30
He adds : `` If for any reason
I do n't have the values , then I wo n't recommend it .
First Boston 's Graeme Anne Lidgerwood values Santa Fe at 24 , down from her earlier estimate of 29 .
Her recent report classifies the stock as a `` hold .
'' But it appears to be the sort of hold one makes while heading for the door .
Quoting from the report : `` The stock 's narrow discount to asset valuation makes it
a relatively unappealing investment at current prices , especially given the risk that our projections could be on the aggressive side .
Chairman Krebs says the California pension fund is getting a bargain price
that would n't have been offered to others .
In other words : The real estate has a higher value than the pending deal suggests .
Since most of the unit 's real estate is in California , the pension fund will be a useful political ally in a state where development is often held hostage to zoning boards .
And , as Mr. Zell says , with Itel and O&Y on the unit 's board , the real estate will be run by `` a very unusual group '' to say the least .
It is possible then that Santa Fe 's real estate -- even in a state imperiled by earthquakes -- could , one day , fetch a king 's ransom .
But as Drexel analyst Linda Dunn notes , its properties will be developed over 15 to 20 years .
So despite Wall Street 's rosy talk of quickly `` maximizing values , '' holders could be in for a long wait .

Stelco Inc. said it plans to shut down three Toronto-area plants , moving their fastener operations to a leased facility in Brantford , Ontario .
The company said the fastener business `` has been under severe cost pressures for some time .
'' The fasteners , nuts and bolts , are sold to the North American auto market .
A company spokesman declined to estimate the impact of the closures on earnings .
He said the new facility will employ 500 of the existing 600 employees .
The steelmaker employs about 16,000 people .
Stelco said it has an option to lease a 350,000-square-foot building in Brantford and proposes to spend 24.5 million Canadian dollars ( US$ 20.9 million ) on the facility .
The three existing plants and their land will be sold .
Joe F. Lynch , the 56-year-old chairman and chief executive officer of First Continental Real Estate Investment Trust , was named to the new post of vice chairman of this bank holding company .
Safeway Stores Inc. reported a 69 % decline in profit for the fiscal third quarter , but said operating improvements were masked by unusual gains in the year-earlier period .
The Oakland grocery retailer , closely held since a $ 4.2 billion leveraged buy-out in 1986 , said profit for the three months ended Sept. 9 was $ 7.1 million , compared with $ 23 million
But it said the year-earlier results included gains of $ 23.5 million from divestitures .
Sales rose 4.2 % to $ 3.31 billion from $ 3.2 billion .
For the nine months , the company said profit fell 49 % to $ 23.5 million from $ 46 million in the year-earlier quarter , which included divestiture-related gains of $ 50.6 million .
Sales increased 5.5 % to $ 9.81 billion from $ 9.3 billion .

Bargain hunters helped stock prices break a weeklong losing streak while bond prices and the dollar inched higher .
The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 6.76 points to 2603.48 in light trading after losing more than 92 points last week .
Bond prices continued to edge higher in anticipation of more news showing a slower economy .
Although the dollar rose slightly against most major currencies , the focus in currency markets was on the beleaguered British pound , which gained slightly against the dollar .
Trading volume on the New York Stock Exchange dwindled to only 126.6 million shares yesterday as major brokerage firms continued to throw in the towel on program trading .
Kidder Peabody became the most recent firm to swear off stock-index arbitrage trading for its own account , and Merrill Lynch late yesterday took the major step of renouncing the trading strategy even for its clients .
Yet that did n't eliminate program trading from the market .
The Dow industrials shot up 23 points in the opening hour , at least in part because of buy programs generated by stock-index arbitrage , a form of program trading involving futures contracts .
But interest waned as the day wore on and investors looked ahead to the release later this week of two important economic reports .
The first is Wednesday 's survey of purchasing managers , considered a good indicator of how the nation 's manufacturing sector fared in October .
The other is Friday 's measure of October employment , an indicator of the broader economy 's health .
Both are expected to show continued sluggishness , which would be good for bonds and bad for stocks .
Stock prices rose in light trading .
But declining issues on the New York Stock Exchange outnumbered gainers 774 to 684 , and broader market indexes were virtually unchanged .
Bond prices crept higher .
The Treasury 's benchmark 30-year bond gained about an eighth of a point , or about $ 1.25 for each $ 1,000 face amount .
The yield on the issue slipped to 7.92 % .
The dollar gained .
In late New York trading the dollar was quoted at 1.8340 marks and 141.90 yen , compared with 1.8300 marks and 141.65 yen Friday .
The British pound , pressured by last week 's resignations of key Thatcher administration officials , nevertheless rose Monday to $ 1.5820 from Friday 's $ 1.5795 .
Upjohn Co. said it will offer an early retirement package to as many as 1,100 employees in a cost-cutting move expected to result in a fourth-quarter charge .
Upjohn officials said they could n't estimate the size of the charge until they determine which employees , and how many , will participate in the retirement plan .
But the pharmaceutical company said it `` anticipates the long-term savings resulting from the plan 's implementation will more than offset short-term costs .
The program , available to Upjohn employees 55 years old or older , could increase an individual 's retirement benefits 10 % to 20 % .
In addition , Upjohn is offering a one-time retirement bonus equal to six months of base pay .
Chairman Theodore Cooper called the program part of the company 's two-year strategy to implement budget constraints and `` an effective headcount-control program .
But some analysts questioned how much of an impact
the retirement package will have , because few jobs will end up being eliminated .
`` It 's a cosmetic move , '' said Jonathan S. Gelles of Wertheim Schroder & Co .
According to Upjohn 's estimates , only 50 % to 60 % of the 1,100 eligible employees will take advantage of the plan .
Upjohn further estimated that about 50 % of the employees
who leave for early retirement may be replaced .
As a result , Upjohn will likely trim only about 275 to 350 of its more than 21,000 jobs world-wide .
In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday , Upjohn shares rose 87.5 cents to $ 38.875 apiece .
An Upjohn spokesman said he had `` heard nothing '' to suggest the early retirement package was spurred by shareholder pressure or a potential bidder for the company , which occasionally has been the target of takeover speculation .
The company earlier this year adopted a shareholder-rights plan to ward off unwanted suitors .
The spokesman said it is the first early retirement plan offered under its two-year cost-control strategy .
Earlier staff-reduction moves have trimmed about 300 jobs , the spokesman said .
At a time when Jon Levy should be planning the biggest spring season in his dress company 's 17 years , his work day is studded with intense moments of concern about one of his biggest customers , Campeau Corp .
`` The dress business has always been a gamble , but it 's never been like this , '' says Mr. Levy , president of St. Gillian Group Ltd. , which has become a hot name thanks to a campaign of sexy TV commercials .
Every day , Mr. Levy checks orders from Campeau department store chains , trying to guess if he will be paid .
`` I 'm now monitoring every major account .
Campeau , owner of such retailers as Bloomingdale 's , Bon Marche , and Jordan Marsh , sidestepped financial collapse last month after an emergency $ 250 million loan from Olympia & York Developments Ltd. , a Canadian developer and a major shareholder in Campeau .
The need for the loan surprised many analysts and bond holders
who had been told at the company 's annual meeting in July that there were n't any major problems ahead .
The risk of doing business with Campeau 's Federated and Allied department store chains is about to increase greatly , not only for Mr. Levy but for hundreds of other small apparel makers , button suppliers , trucking firms and fabric houses .
Next week , the country 's top designers and manufacturers will begin showing fashions for spring 1990 , the second
most important selling season of the year .
And as the applause dies down in showrooms along Seventh Avenue and Broadway , stylishly clad Campeau buyers will begin writing orders .
Orders from Campeau retailers used to be cause for celebration .
This is no longer true because of Campeau 's massive debt load .
`` It 's all
anybody wants to talk about , '' says Richard Posner , executive vice president for Credit Exchange Inc. , a leading credit service .
`` People wonder what 's going to happen next .
Many manufacturers are worried about being paid for merchandise already shipped to Campeau stores .
But those dollars at risk pale in comparison to the investment required to make and ship spring goods to Campeau stores .
`` The few million dollars I could lose today is nothing against what
I could lose on the spring line , '' says Mr. Levy , who estimates that Campeau stores will sell $ 25 million worth of his clothes
`` I 'm buying fabric right now for clothes
I may not be paid for until April or May .
What happens to me if Campeau collapses between now and then ?
Some credit concerns , such as Bernard Sands Credit Consultants Inc. , have told clients not to ship anything to Federated or Allied stores on credit .
`` This is especially true for spring merchandise , '' says Jim Rindos , credit manager at Bernard Sands .
`` Campeau has too much debt .
Other credit houses , such as Credit Exchange and Solo Credit Service Corp. , are suggesting that their clients study each order before shipping .
`` Payments are good right now , but we are n't recommending any long-term lines of credit , '' says Richard Hastings , a retail credit analyst , referring to credit lines
which make inventory purchases automatic .
`` The Campeau situation is a little uncertain and very difficult to analyze .
Because of those concerns , some manufacturers say they will ask for letters of credit before shipping spring merchandise .
`` We 're being paid today , but we 're worried about tomorrow and will want '' letters of credit , says the sales director at one major dress maker
who asked not to be identified .
Howard Bloom , president of the dress firm Chetta B Inc. , says : `` It 's big time chaos today .
I 'm going to ship and hope I get paid .
If I need to ask for money up front later , I will .
Carol Sanger , vice president , corporate communications at Campeau , says that all of the Federated and Allied chains are paying their bills in a timely manner .
`` They continue to pay their bills and will do so , '' says Ms. Sanger .
`` We 're confident we 'll be paying our bills for spring merchandise as well .
Typically , manufacturers are paid 10 days after the month in which
they ship .
If goods are shipped to Bloomingdale 's between Oct. 1 and Oct. 20 , manufacturers expect to be paid by Nov. 10 .
But manufacturers now buying fabric for spring season goods wo n't be paid until March , April or even May .
Some in the market question whether Campeau will be in a position to pay bills at that time .
`` Everybody is worried about the possibility of cancellations , '' says Kurt Barnard , publisher of Barnard 's Retail Marketing Report .
`` The buyers
who work for the various Campeau chains may lose their jobs .
The stores they work for may be sold .
that will mean for manufacturers is anybody
's guess .
Campeau 's financial situation is complicated by an estimated $ 1.23 billion in debt due next spring .
This includes a working capital facility for Allied Stores of $ 350 million
that matures March 15 , 1990 , and an $ 800 million bridge loan due April 30 , 1990 .
The company has stated in recently filed financial documents that it anticipates refinancing its March 1990 payments .
In recent months , numerous retailers have filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection , including Bonwit Teller , B. Altman & Co. , and Miller & Rhoads Inc .
Those filings , plus the expected sale of a number of financially healthy chains , such as Saks Fifth Avenue , Marshall Field 's and Bloomingdale 's , have added to the anxiety .
`` Right now , Federated owes us
a considerable amount of money , '' says Morris Marmalstein , president of David Warren Enterprises , a major dress manufacturer .
`` We expect they will be current with their debts by the end of the week , but we are considering asking them for letters of credit before we take more orders .
Mr. Marmalstein adds that his company is now holding some goods in anticipation of being paid in full .
`` It 's become a day-by-day business , '' he says .
`` Business has never been this tough before .
Not only does your product have to be excellent , but you also have to be able to collect .
Other manufacturers are equally cautious .
Bud Konheim , president of Nicole Miller Inc. , says his company is now shipping only to the flagship stores of the Federated and Allied chains .
This limits his financial exposure , he says .
`` The branches are just warmed over , empty halls , '' says Mr. Konheim .
`` Why should I be part of that problem ?
I 've got limited production , and I ca n't give it to underperformers .
Campeau 's Ms. Sanger disputes Mr. Konheim 's comments .
`` Many of the branches are very lucrative , '' she says .
`` That 's just nonsense .
As for Mr. Levy at St. Gillian , he says he will maintain his credit lines with the various Campeau stores unless they miss a payment .
`` If they slip for 10 cents for 10 minutes , I 'll stop , '' he says .
A lack of enthusiasm with the latest economic data hampered the stock market 's bid to extend Tuesday 's sharp gains , as prices closed slightly higher in sluggish trading .
While renewed optimism about the outlook for takeover activity boosted several so-called deal stocks , traders said profit-taking weighed on the market , with blue-chips bearing the brunt of the selling .
The Dow Jones Industrial Average , which had jumped 41.60 points on Tuesday , drifted on either side of its previous close and finished with a gain of just 0.82 at 2645.90 .
Standard & Poor 's 500-Stock Index added 0.84 to 341.20 ; the rise was equivalent to a gain of about six points in the industrial average .
The Dow Jones Equity Market Index gained 0.99 to 319.75 and the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index went up 0.60 to 188.84 .
Advancing stocks led decliners on the New York Stock Exchange by 847 to 644 .
Big Board volume amounted to 154,240,000 shares , down from 176.1 million Tuesday .
The October survey of corporate purchasing managers , as expected , provided evidence that economic growth remains subdued .
An index of economic activity drawn from the survey stood last month at 47.6 % ; a reading above 50 % would have indicated that the manufacturing sector was improving .
But with the index proving somewhat better than expected and the widely anticipated report on October employment scheduled to arrive tomorrow , stock prices firmed only modestly in response to the report and then faltered .
`` This market 's still going through its pains , '' said Philip Puccio , head of equity trading at Prudential-Bache Securities .
`` The psychology is still : ` We want ( stocks ) up , but if they do n't carry we 're going to sell them .
Uncertainty about the prospects for further action to curtail stock-index arbitrage , a form of program trading blamed for recent volatility in the market , also contributed to its lack of direction , Mr. Puccio said .
Arbitrage-related trading during the session was confined largely to a round of buy programs near the close , which helped offset the impact of profit-taking among blue chips .
Trading is expected to remain subdued as the market awaits tomorrow 's release of the jobs data with the hope that it will point toward a decline in interest rates .
`` I sense that some people are reluctant to stick their necks out in any aggressive way until after the figures come out , '' said Richard Eakle , president of Eakle Associates , Fair Haven ,
Campbell Soup jumped 3 3\/8 to 47 1\/8 as the resignation of R. Gordon McGovern as president and chief executive officer sparked a revival of rumors that the company could become a takeover target .
Prudential-Bache Securities boosted the stock 's short-term investment rating in response to the departure ; analyst John McMillin said he believes the company will turn to new management `` that 's more financially oriented .
Other rumored takeover and restructuring candidates to attract buyers included Woolworth , which went up 1 3\/4 to 59 1\/2 ; Avon Products , up 1 3\/4 to 29 1\/4 ; Paramount Communications , up 2 to 57 7\/8 , and Ferro , up 2 5\/8 to 28 3\/4 .

Texaco rose 3\/4 to 53 3\/8 as 4.4 million shares changed hands .
Most of the volume came from trades designed to capture the stock 's next dividend ; Texaco has a yield of 5.6 % and goes ex-dividend today .
Santa Fe Pacific dropped 1 1\/8 to 17 3\/4 .

The sums awarded to Messrs. Kelly and Newcomb represent bonuses the two men said they deserved from the first
half of 1988 , but which were n't paid because of a dispute over an incentive contract .
Jeffrey L. Liddle , the two men 's attorney at Liddle , O'Connor , Finkelstein & Robinson , said Mr. Kelly began working at Dean Witter in 1987 .
Mr. Kelly built the company 's high-yield bond group , which has been a minor player in the junk-bond arena .
Dean Witter lost a separate case involving a former bond executive earlier this year ; in August
it paid $ 666,666 in back pay and a bonus to a former corporate-bond trading chief , Harold Bachman .
That award ended a dispute between Dean Witter and Mr. Bachman over who was responsible for certain bond-trading losses around the time of the 1987 stock-market crash .
A spokesman for Dean Witter , a unit of Sears , Roebuck & Co. , declined to comment .
R. Gordon McGovern was forced out as Campbell Soup Co. 's president and chief executive officer , the strongest evidence yet of the power
that Dorrance family members intend to wield in reshaping the troubled food company .
Herbert M. Baum , the 53-year-old president of the company 's Campbell U.S.A. unit , and Edwin L. Harper , 47 , the chief financial officer , will run Campbell as a team , dividing responsibilities rather evenly until a successor is named .
The board already has been searching for strong outside candidates , including food-industry executives with considerable international experience .
Wall Street reacted favorably to Mr. McGovern 's departure and its implications .
In heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange , Campbell 's shares rose $ 3.375 to close at $ 47.125 .
`` The profit motive of the major shareholders has clearly changed for the better , '' said John McMillin , a food industry analyst for Prudential-Bache in New York .
Mr. McGovern was widely seen as sales , and not profit , oriented .
`` New managers would think a little more like Wall Street , '' Mr. McMillin added .
Some of the surge in the stock 's price appeared to be linked to revived takeover speculation , which has contributed to volatility of Campbell shares in recent months .
Campbell 's international businesses , particularly in the U.K. and Italy , appear to be at the heart of its problems .
Growth has fallen short of targets and operating earnings are far below results in U.S. units .
For example , Campbell is a distant third in the U.K. frozen foods market , where it recently paid 24 times earnings for Freshbake Foods PLC and wound up with far more capacity than it could use .
Similarly , Campbell 's Italian biscuit operation , D. Lazzaroni & Co. , has been hurt by overproduction and distribution problems .
Such problems will require considerable skill to resolve .
However , neither Mr. Baum nor Mr. Harper has much international experience .
Mr. Baum , a seasoned marketer
who is said to have a good rapport with Campbell employees , will have responsibility for all domestic operations except the Pepperidge Farm unit .
Mr. Harper , a veteran of several manufacturing companies
who joined Campbell in 1986 , will take charge of all overseas operations as well as Pepperidge .
In an joint interview yesterday , both
men said they would like to be the company 's next chief executive .
Mr. McGovern , 63 , had been under intense pressure from the board to boost Campbell 's mediocre performance to the level of other food companies .
The board is dominated by the heirs of the late John T. Dorrance Jr. , who controlled about 58 % of Campbell 's stock when he died in April .
In recent months , Mr. Dorrance 's children and other family members have pushed for improved profitability and higher returns on their equity .
In August , the company took a $ 343 million pretax charge against fiscal 1989 earnings when it announced a world-wide restructuring plan .
The plan calls for closing at least nine plants and eliminating about 3,600 jobs .
But analysts said early results from the reorganization have been disappointing , especially in Europe , and there were signs that the board became impatient .
Campbell officials said Mr. McGovern was n't available yesterday to discuss the circumstances of his departure .
The company 's prepared statement quoted him as saying , `` The CEO succession is well along and I 've decided for personal reasons to take early retirement .
But people familiar with the agenda of the board 's meeting last week in London said Mr. McGovern was fired .
Mr. McGovern himself had said repeatedly that he intended to stay on until he reached the conventional retirement age of 65 in October 1991 , `` unless I get fired .
'' Campbell said Mr. McGovern had withdrawn his name as a candidate for re-election as a director at the annual shareholder meeting , scheduled for Nov. 17 .
For fiscal 1989 , Mr. McGovern received a salary of $ 877,663 .
He owns about 45,000 shares of Campbell stock and has options to buy more than 100,000 additional shares .
He will be eligible for an annual pension of more than $ 244,000 with certain other fringe benefits .
During Mr. McGovern 's nine-year term as president , the company 's sales rose to $ 5.7 billion from $ 2.8 billion and net income increased to $ 274 million from $ 130 million , the statement said .
Mr. Baum said he and Mr. Harper
both advocated closing some plants as long ago as early 1988 .
`` You 've got to make the restructuring work , '' said Mr. Baum .
`` You 've got to make those savings now .
Mr. Harper expressed confidence that he and Mr. Baum can convince the board of their worthiness to run the company .
`` We look upon this as a great opportunity to prove the fact that we have a tremendous management team , '' he said .
He predicted that the board would give the current duo until early next year before naming a new chief executive .
Mr. Baum said the two have orders to `` focus on bottom-line profits '' and to `` take a hard look at our businesses -- what is good , what is not so good .
'' Analysts generally applaud the performance of Campbell U.S.A. , the company 's largest division , which posted 6 % unit sales growth and a 15 % improvement in operating profit for fiscal 1989 .
`` The way that we 've been managing Campbell U.S.A. can hopefully spread to other areas of the company , '' Mr. Baum said .
In the interview at headquarters yesterday afternoon , both
men exuded confidence and seemed to work well together .
`` You 've got two champions sitting right before you , '' said Mr. Baum .
`` We play to win .
McCaw Cellular Communications Inc. said it obtained `` firm '' financing commitments from three major banks in regard to its offer for 50.3 % of LIN Broadcasting Corp .
Morgan Guaranty Trust , Toronto-Dominion Bank and Provident National Bank , an affiliate of PNC Financial Corp. , jointly committed $ 1.2 billion of financing , subject to certain conditions , McCaw said .
Further , McCaw said the banks expressed confidence that the balance of the $ 4.5 billion bank facility will be committed within the next several weeks by a syndicate of foreign and domestic banks .
Morgan , Toronto-Dominion and Provident are leading that syndicate .
McCaw is offering to buy 22 million shares of LIN for $ 125 each in cash , which would result in McCaw owning 50.3 % of the cellular-phone and broadcasting concern .
The offer is in limbo , however , because LIN has agreed to merge its cellular-phone businesses with BellSouth Corp .
In national over-the-counter trading Friday , LIN shares rose 62.5 cents to close at $ 110.625 .
Beijing lawmakers have called for jails to be built to house prostitutes and for severe punishment , including the death sentence , for anyone
who induces or coerces women into prostitution .
The official Xinhua News Agency said the municipal government was discussing a draft bill to give the capital its first anti-prostitution statutes .
It quoted Liu Changyi , deputy director of the Beijing Public Security Bureau , as saying that there were many more people involved in prostitution now than in 1985 , when there were about 100 cases .
Foreigners involved in prostitution will be punished according to the law , and those with sexually transmitted diseases will be expelled from the country , according to the regulations .
The Communists nearly succeeded in eliminating prostitution after taking over in 1949 , but the practice has returned in recent years with the country 's increased exposure to the outside world .
Japan agreed to enforce a decision by an international wildlife conference to ban all trade in ivory , a spokesman for the Ministry of International Trade and Industry said .
Earlier , Japan had said it might file a reservation against the ivory ban decided by ballot at the 103-nation United Nations Conference on International Trade in Endangered Species in Switzerland last week .
The Japanese use 40 % of the world 's ivory .

East Germany pledged to reduce alcohol consumption by boosting production of soft drinks and fruit juices .
Trade and Supply Minister Gerhard Briksa said in a letter published in the youth daily Junge Welt that the rise in alcohol consumption in East Germany had been halted ; but to reduce it further , he said , production and supply of other beverages , including fruit juices , should be stepped up .
He added that shops will have to continue reducing their stocks of liquor and avoid displaying them too prominently in the window .
Hong Kong has built a detention center for illegal immigrants from China because China has refused for the past two weeks to accept them back .
The center , close to Hong Kong 's border with China , will be ready today and will be able to house 1,000 inmates , Police Deputy Director Peter Wong said .
The dispute started when China , angry that Hong Kong had allowed dissident swimmer Yang Yang to flee to the U.S. , halted the usual daily transfer of illegal immigrants caught in this British colony , which reverts to Beijing 's control in 1997 .
Sweating under the glare of newly installed television lights , British members of Parliament demanded a halt to the experimental televising of debates .

A majority of Japanese banks are said to be wary of making new loans to Mexico under the Brady plan because they 're uncertain the Mexican economy will remain stable .
Instead , many small and medium-sized banks , and some larger ones , are likely to take one of the other two options open to them under the plan , Japanese banking officials said .
The plan , proposed by U.S. Secretary of State Nicholas Brady , calls for banks either to make new loans or to reduce the principle on existing loans or to cut the interest rate on those existing loans .
The officials said that most Japanese banks prefer the losses they 'd suffer in either of the latter options to the risk of new lending .
But an official at a long-term credit bank explained that since some larger banks have already taken loss provisions for loans to other Third World nations , further write-offs could be viewed as intolerable .
`` They ca n't take the hit '' to their earnings , he said .
As a result , the official said , they may be forced into a no-win situation in which
they make risky loans that they could have to write off later .

But no matter how much Japan gets under our skin , we 'll still have mom and apple pie .
On second thought , make that just mom .
A Japanese apple called the Fuji is cropping up in orchards
the way Hondas did on U.S. roads .
By 1995 it will be planted more often than any other apple tree , according to a recent survey of six apple-industry sages by Washington State University horticulturist Robert Norton .
Some fruit visionaries say the Fuji could someday tumble the Red Delicious from the top of America 's apple heap .
It certainly wo n't get there on looks .
Compared to the Red Delicious , the exemplar of apple pulchritude , the Fuji is decidedly more dowdy -- generally smaller , less-perfectly shaped , greenish , with tinges of red .
To hear most U.S. growers tell it , we 'd still be in Paradise if the serpent had proffered one to Eve .
But how sweet
it is .
It has more sugar `` than any apple
we 've ever tested , '' says Duane Greene , a University of Massachusetts pomologist , or apple scholar .
It has a long shelf life and `` does n't fool the public , '' says Grady Auvil , an Orondo , Wash. , grower
who is planting Fujis and spreading the good word about them .
`` It does n't look nice on the outside while getting mealy inside .
Mr. Auvil , razor sharp at 83 , has picked and packed a zillion pecks of apples over the past 65 years .
He is known as the father of the U.S.-grown Granny Smith , a radically different apple that the conventional wisdom once said would never catch on .
It did , shaking the apple establishment to its roots .
Now , even more radical changes seem afoot as the grand old maverick of American apples plays the role of Hiroshi Appleseed .
`` The Fuji is going to be No. 1 to replace the Red Delicious , '' he says .
The Delicious hegemony wo n't end anytime soon .
New apple trees grow slowly , and the Red Delicious is almost as entrenched as mom .
Its roots are patriotic -- with the first trees appearing in 1872 in an orchard near Peru , Iowa , to be exact .
For more than 50 years , it has been the apple of our eye .
A good Delicious can indeed be delicious .
More than twice as many Red Delicious apples are grown as the Golden variety , America 's No. 2 apple .
But the apple industry is ripe for change .
`` Red Delicious has been overplanted , and its prices have dropped below the cost of production , '' says Washington State 's Mr. Norton .
The scare over Alar , a growth regulator
that makes apples redder and crunchier but may be carcinogenic , made consumers shy away from the Delicious , though they were less affected than the McIntosh .
The glut and consequent lower prices , combined with cancer fears , was a very serious blow to growers .
`` A lot of growers wo n't be around in a few years , '' says Mr. Norton , although they have stopped using Alar .
One may be William Broderick , a Sterling , Mass. , grower .
`` This is beautiful stuff , '' he says , looking ruefully at big boxes of just-picked Red Delicious next to his barn .
`` But I 'm going to lose $ 50,000 to $ 60,000 on it .
I 'm going to have to get another job
this year just to eat .
Besides rotten prices , he has been hit recently by hail , a bark-nibbling horde of mice , fungi and bugs .
Some 500 insects and 150 diseases wiggle , chew and romp through growers ' nightmares , including maggots , mites , mildew , thrips , black rot and the flat-headed borer .
Even if a grower beats them back , his $ 2,000 rented bees might buzz off to the neighbors ' orchards instead of pollinating his , Mr. Broderick says .
Though growers ca n't always keep the worm from the apple , they can protect themselves against the price vagaries of any one variety by diversifying -- into the recently imported Gala , a sweet New Zealand native ; the Esopus Spitzenburg , reportedly Thomas Jefferson 's favorite apple ; disease-resistant kinds like the Liberty .
`` I 've ripped out a lot of Delicious '' and grafted the trees with many different shoots , says Steve Wood , a West Lebanon , N.H. , grower , tramping through his 100-acre Poverty Lane Orchard on a crisp autumn day recently .
`` I 've got 70 kinds of apples .
Here 's a Waltana , '' he exclaims , picking one off a tree .
He bites it , scowls and throws it down .
`` It 's a real dog .
Supermarkets are getting into the variety act , too .
They still buy apples mainly for big , red good looks -- that 's why so many taste like woodchucks ' punching bags .
But freshness counts more than it once did , and stores are expanding shelf space for unconventional , but tastier , and often pricier , apples .
`` Rather than sell 39-cents-a-pound Delicious , maybe we can sell 79-cents-a-pound Fujis , '' says Chuck Tryon , perishables director for Super Valu Inc. , a Minneapolis supermarket chain and food distributor .
The Fuji is a product of meticulous Japanese pomological engineering , which fostered it
50 years ago at a government research orchard .
Japanese researchers have bred dozens of strains of Fujis to hone its color , taste and shelf life .
Now the best of them
age as gracefully as Grannies , the industry 's gold standard for storability .
In the cornucopia of go-go apples , the Fuji 's track record stands out : During the past 15 years , it has gone from almost zilch to some 50 % of Japan 's market .
`` The Japanese apple market is very keyed to high quality , '' says David Lane , a scientist at a Canadian horticulture research center in Summerland , British Columbia , and so apples are more of a delicacy there than a big food commodity .
The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates that this year Americans will eat about 40 %
more fresh apples per capita than the Japanese .
The Fuji is still small potatoes in the U.S. , sold mainly in fruit boutiques .
But in California , says Craig Ito , a Fuji-apple grower , `` There 's a Fuji apple cult .
Once somebody eats one , they get hooked .
Mr. Auvil , the Washington grower , says that he could sell Fujis to Taiwan buyers at $ 40
a box if he had them .
( Taiwan already is a big importer of Fujis from other places , he adds .
) But his first crop wo n't be picked till next year .
`` I expect to see the demand exceed supply for Fujis for the next 10 to 15 years , '' he adds .
Washington Red Delicious , by the way , are wholesaling for less than $ 10
a box these days .
Mr. Auvil sees Fujis , in part , as striking a blow against the perversion of U.S. apples by supermarkets .
`` When the chain stores took over , there was no longer a connection between grower and consumer .
A guy is sitting up in an office deciding what
you 're going to eat .
After all , until the 1950s even the Red Delicious was a firm , delectable morsel .
Then , as growers bred them more for looks , and to satisfy supermarket chains ' demands of long-term storage , the Red went into decline .
Now , those red applelike things stores sell in summer are fruitbowl lovely , but usually not good eating .
They do deserve respect , however -- they are almost a year old , probably equal to about 106 in human years .
The Fuji , to be sure , has blemishes too .
It ripens later than most apples , and growing it in U.S. areas with chilly autumns may be tricky .
Moreover , the frumpy Fuji must compete with an increasingly dolledup Delicious .
Mr. Broderick , the Massachusetts grower , says the `` big boss '' at a supermarket chain even rejected his Red Delicious recently because they were n't waxed and brushed for extra shine .
And he had n't used hormones , which
many growers employ to elongate their Delicious apples for greater eye appeal .
Still , Mr. Auvil points out , Grannies became popular without big , red looks , so why not Fujis ?
He sees a shift in American values -- at least regarding apples -- toward more emphasis on substance and less on glitz .
`` Taste has finally come to the fore , '' he says .
Or , for that matter , the core .
At the ritzy Fashion Island Shopping Center , the tanned and elegant ladies of this wealthy Southern California beach community disembark from their Mercedes-Benzes and BMWs for another day of exercising their credit cards .
They root among the designer offerings at Neiman-Marcus and Bullocks Wilshire .
They stroll through the marble-encased corridors of the Atrium Court .
They graze at the Farmers Market , a combination gourmet food court and grocery store , while a pianist accompanies the noon fashion show with a selection of dreamy melodies .
`` The beautiful look of wool , '' croons the show 's narrator , `` slightly Victorian in its influence ... .
Meanwhile , in the squat office buildings
that ring Fashion Island , the odds are good that someone is getting fleeced .
Law-enforcement authorities say that at any given time , a host of fraudulent telemarketing operations mingle with the many legitimate businesses here .
`` They seem to like these industrial parks , '' says Kacy McClelland , a postal inspector
who specializes in mail fraud .
`` We call them
fraud farms .
Welcome to that welter of contradictions known as Newport Beach .
This city of more than 70,000 is known for sunshine , yachts and rich residents .
It is also known as the fraud capital of the U.S. , dubbed by investigators and the media as the `` Cote de Fraud '' .
How does a community famous for its high living end up as a haven for low-lifes ?
Clearly , the existence of the former lures
the latter .
The places renowned for breeding bunco , like the Miami neighborhood known as the `` Maggot Mile '' and Las Vegas 's flashy strip of casinos , invariably offer fast cars , high rollers , glamorous women and lots of sunshine .
You do n't hear much about unusual concentrations of fraud in Green Bay or Buffalo .
Con men hate snow .
Newport Beach fits the scam artists ' specifications perfectly .
What more could a con man in search of the easy life ask for ?
Nothing seems hard here .
The breezes are soft , the waves lap gently and the palm trees sway lazily .
Nightlife is plentiful .
Moreover , ostentation is appreciated .
The median price of homes is $ 547,000 ; more than 9,000 vessels fill what
the chamber of commerce calls the nation 's largest pleasure-boat harbor .
`` Blondes , cocaine and Corvettes , '' mutters Mr. McClelland .
`` That 's what
they 're after .
The rich image of Newport Beach also helps lend the con artists ' operation
an air of respectability .
`` One reason
they use Newport Beach is that it sounds swankier than most addresses , '' says David Katz , a U.S. attorney
who , until recently , headed a multi-agency Southern California fraud task force .
`` Newport Beach is known in Rhode Island for having a lot of rich people .
No wonder all kinds of big-time scams have flourished here , from phony tax-sheltered Bible sales to crooked car dealers to bogus penny-stock traders .
But above all , this is the national headquarters for boiler-room operators , those slick-talking snake-oil salesmen
who use the telephone to extract money from the gullible and the greedy and then vanish .
Because only a fraction of them are ever prosecuted , nobody really knows how much money bogus telemarketing operators really harvest .
`` I 've heard that there is $ 40 billion taken in nationwide by boiler rooms
every year , '' Mr. McClelland says .
`` If that 's true , Orange County has to be at least 10 % of that .
And most of the truly big scams in Orange County seem to originate in Newport Beach or one of the other well-heeled communities
that surround this sliver-like city
that hooks around a point of land on the California coast south of Los Angeles .
In fact , sophisticated big-bucks boiler-room scams are known generically among law-enforcement types as `` Newport Beach '' operations .
That contrasts with the penny-ante sales of things such as pen-and-pencil sets and office supplies
that are known as `` Hollywood '' scams .
Newport Beach telemarketers concentrate on precious metals and oil-leasing deals
that typically cost thousands of dollars
a shot .
The investors range from elderly widows to affluent professionals .
In one ingenious recent example of a Newport Beach boiler room , prospective investors in Capital Trust Inc. were allegedly told that their investment in precious metals was insured against losses `` caused by employees due to dishonesty , destruction or disappearance , '' according to an indictment handed up by a federal grand jury in Los Angeles last month .
Thus falsely reassured , investors sent $ 11.4 million to the Newport Beach company , most of which was diverted to unauthorized uses , the indictment charges .
Douglas Jones , an attorney representing Richard O. Kelly Sr. , the chairman and president of Capital Trust , says his client denies that there was any attempt to defraud investors .
`` There were some business deals
that went bad , '' Mr. Jones says , `` but no intent to defraud .
'' Newport Beach operations differ from the Hollywood boiler rooms in style as well as in dollars .
Traditionally , boiler rooms operate on the cheap , since few , if any , customers ever visit their offices .
Indeed , the name derives from the tendency among telemarketing scammers to rent cheap basement space , near the boiler room .
But , says Mr. Katz , the U.S. attorney , `` the interesting thing about Newport Beach operations is that they give themselves
the indulgence of beautiful offices , with plush furnishings .
When we go there , it 's quite different from these Hollywood places where the sandwiches are spread out on the table and the people are picking their noses .
The Newport Beach operators also tend to indulge themselves privately .
Investigators cite the case of Matthew Valentine , who is currently serving a six-year sentence at Lompoc Federal Prison for his role in Intech Investment Corp. , which promised investors returns of as much as 625 % on precious metals .
Mr. Valentine , who pleaded guilty to five counts of fraud in federal court in Los Angeles , drove a leased Mercedes and lived in an expensive home on Lido Isle , an island in Newport 's harbor , according to investigators .
With the $ 3 million received from investors , he took frequent junkets with friends to exotic locales and leased an expensive BMW for his girlfriend , whom
he met at the shop where he got his custom-tailored suits .
`` It 's amazing the amount of money
that goes up their nose , out to the dog track or to the tables in Las Vegas , '' Mr. Katz says .
All this talk of boiler rooms and fraud is unnerving to the city 's legitimate business element .
Vincent M Ciavarella , regional manager of Property Management Systems , insists he does n't know of any bogus telemarketers operating in the 1.6 million square feet of office space around Fashion Island that his company leases for Irvine Co. , the owner and developer of the project .
Mr. Ciavarella has rejected a few prospective tenants
who provided `` incomplete '' financial information and acknowledges that illegitimate operators `` are not easily detectable .
'' ( Investigators stress that building owners are victims , too , since boiler rooms often leave without paying rent .
Richard Luehrs , president of the Newport Harbor Area Chamber of Commerce , calls boiler rooms
a `` negative we wish we could get rid of .
'' Actually , `` we do n't get much negative publicity about this , '' he insists , `` except for the press
who write about it .

One day after Delmed Inc. made top management changes and disclosed the end of an important business tie , its stock did n't trade and the company forecast a `` significant '' drop next year in sales of its core product .
That disclosure came , a Delmed spokeswoman said , after the American Stock Exchange alerted the company that trading would n't resume in its stock until additional information about developments was provided .
In addition to the forecast , the company also said it is examining potential cost cuts and reductions in overhead .
The spokeswoman said the exchange would resume trading of Delmed stock today .
Delmed , which makes and sells peritoneal dialysis products used in treating kidney disease , on Tuesday announced the resignations of Robert S. Ehrlich , chairman , president and chief executive officer , and of Leslie I. Shapiro , chief operating officer and chief financial officer .
They were succeeded by executives of Fresenius USA Inc. and its parent , Fresenius AG , which owns about 45 % of Delmed .
At the same time , the New Brunswick , N.J. , company said negotiations about pricing and volumes of product had collapsed between it and its exclusive distributor in the U.S. , National Medical Care Inc .
Following that announcement Tuesday , however , company officials were unavailable to elaborate .
Yesterday , the spokeswoman said sales of Delmed products through the exclusive arrangement with National Medical accounted for 87 % of Delmed 's 1988 sales of $ 21.1 million .
The current distribution arrangement ends in March 1990 , although Delmed said it will continue to provide some supplies of the peritoneal dialysis products to National Medical , the spokeswoman said .
Nonetheless , `` Delmed currently expects that 1990 sales ... will be significantly below their 1989 level , '' the company said in a statement .
Delmed said yesterday that Fresenius USA would begin distributing the product and that the company is investigating other possible distribution channels .
In any case , supplies to patients wo n't be interrupted , the company added .
Fresenius , a West German pharmaceutical concern , has been discussing a transaction in which
it would buy Delmed stock for cash to bring its beneficial ownership to between 70 % and 80 % .
But the plan now is being `` reformulated , '' Delmed said , declining to provide most of the new terms of the combination .
Said the spokeswoman : `` The whole structure has changed .
The value of the company has changed .
Delmed did say that the proposal still would infuse cash into Delmed but less than the $ 10 million originally expected .
Delmed also would receive the North American rights to certain Fresenius AG products .
Another option for Delmed , the company said , is that it could sell its plant in Ogden , Utah .
It added that no discussions about such a sale are under way .
West German insurance giant Allianz AG entered the takeover battle between France 's Cie .
Financiere de Paribas and Cie. de Navigation Mixte .
Allianz said it won French government approval to buy as much as one-third of Navigation Mixte , a diversified financial , transport and food holding company .
The move comes a week after Paribas announced that it was preparing to bid for 66.7 % control of Navigation Mixte .
Munich-based Allianz 's brief explanatory statement said it is acting to protect its own interests as a shareholder of Navigation Mixte .
That would be a blow to both Paribas and Navigation Mixte .
Each had claimed Allianz , Europe 's largest insurance company , as a tacit ally .
The Allianz statement also reinforced the belief that the takeover battle could be a long one .
It led to broad market speculation that Paribas now will sweeten its bid , which is expected to be formally launched later this week , after approval from French government regulators .
Allianz 's entry reflects the increasing eagerness of West German companies , looking ahead to the reduction in European Community internal barriers in 1992 , to get involved in what until now were considered internal French affairs .
Deutsche Bank , Dresdner Bank and Commerzbank all also have expressed eagerness to expand in France before 1992 .
Dresdner Bank
this month moved to acquire Banque Internationale des Placements , a small French merchant bank that Deutsche Bank had looked at and passed over .
Commerzbank had hoped to buy a stake in Credit Lyonnais , until the Socialists returned to government last year and canceled plans to privatize the large French bank .
Deutsche Bank has actively sought a French acquisition for at least two years .
Lately , analysts say , Deutsche Bank has shocked some in the French financial community by indicating it wants a strong bank with a large number of branches .
`` We are still looking , '' said a Deutsche Bank spokesman .
`` The banks we think would fit into our concept are either government-owned or not for sale , though Deutsche Bank would be able to pay a good price .
While Allianz officials were n't willing to comment in any detail on their plans , they said Allianz currently holds between 5 % and 10 % of Navigation Mixte , an apparent increase from the 5 % stake that Navigation Mixte officials had earlier announced .
Paris market sources said they believed Allianz was buying yesterday morning , and Navigation Mixte moved up 108 francs ( $ 17.19 ) to close at 1,908 francs in heavy trading .
It was the first day of trading following the suspension of Navigation Mixte shares last Monday , when Paribas announced its plan to pay 1,850 francs for each Navigation Mixte share .
Allianz also holds a 50 % stake in Navigation Mixte 's insurance subsidiary , one of France 's largest insurance groups , which
it bought for about 6.5 billion francs just before Paribas launched its bid .
Navigation Mixte holds the remaining 50 % .
Allianz said in its statement that it was acting to protect that interest , which ties it to Navigation Mixte as a partner .
Allianz 's statement stressed the company 's previously announced position that Paribas 's offer price is too low .
Allianz also suggested , without saying so directly , that it regrets that Paribas is n't bidding for all of Navigation Mixte 's shares .
The problem here , analysts say , is that if Paribas wins its 66.7 % , remaining Navigation Mixte shares will fall in value .
That displeases many current holders , such as Allianz , which could n't be sure of selling all their shares if they tendered to Paribas .
The Allianz statement led to speculation that Allianz eventually could sell to Paribas .
That would be bad news for Navigation Mixte 's current management , which was counting on Allianz to help fend off Paribas .
Allianz did n't say whom , if anyone , it will support .
It said simply that it will boost its Navigation Mixte stake as it sees fit over the coming days to protect itself , as long as it has French regulatory officials ' approval .
Paribas currently intends to offer 1,850 francs
a share for Navigation Mixte shares
that receive full dividends
It is to offer 1,800 francs for shares created on July 1 , which receive partial dividends .
Alternatively , it would offer to swap three Paribas shares for one Navigation Mixte share .
Paribas already holds about 18.7 % of Navigation Mixte , and the acquisition of the additional 48 % would cost it about 11 billion francs under its current bid .
The bid values Navigation Mixte at around 23 billion francs , depending on how many holders of Navigation Mixte warrants exchange them for shares before the bid expires .
A group of investors led by Giant Group Ltd. and its chairman , Burt Sugarman , said it filed with federal antitrust regulators for clearance to buy more than 50 % of the stock of Rally 's Inc. , a fast-food company based in Louisville , Ky .
Rally 's operates and franchises about 160 fast-food restaurants throughout the U.S .
The company went public earlier this month , offering 1,745,000 shares of common stock at $ 15
Giant has interests in cement making and newsprint .
The investor group includes Restaurant Investment Partnership , a California general partnership , and three Rally 's directors : Mr. Sugarman , James M. Trotter III and William E. Trotter II .
The group currently holds 3,027,330 Rally 's shares , or 45.2 % of its commmon shares outstanding .
Giant Group owned 22 % of Rally 's shares before the initial public offering .
A second group of three company directors , aligned with Rally 's founder James Patterson , also is seeking control of the fast-food chain .
It is estimated that the Patterson group controls more than 40 % of Rally 's stock .
Rally officials were n't available to comment late yesterday .
For the year ended July 2 , Rally had net income of $ 2.4 million , or 34 cents
a share , on revenue of $ 52.9 million .
The amendment , offered by Rep. Douglas Bosco ( D. , Calif. ) , was approved 283-132 during debate on a bill designed to strengthen the Transportation Department 's authority in dealing with leveraged buy-outs of airlines .
The bill would require the agency to block the acquisition of 15 % or more of an airline 's stock if the purchase threatened safety , reduced the carrier 's ability to compete , or put the airline under foreign control .
Debate on the legislation , which faces a veto threat from President Bush , is to continue today .
The amendment would require the department to block the purchase of a major airline by anyone
who has run two or more carriers
that have filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code .
In 1983 , Texas Air 's Continental Airlines filed for bankruptcy .
Earlier this year , Texas Air 's Eastern Airlines filed for bankruptcy .
`` This ought to be subtitled the ` Do n't let Frank Lorenzo take over another airline ' amendment , '' said Rep. James Oberstar ( D. , Minn. ) , chairman of the House aviation subcommittee , who argued that the provision was unnecessary because the bill already would give the department ample power to block undesirable deals .
Dennis R. Mangino , a general manager of EniChem Americas , was named vice president of research and development , a new post at this steel company .
Many small investors are facing a double whammy
this year : They got hurt by investing in the highly risky junk bond market , and the pain is worse because they did it with borrowed money .
These people invested in `` leveraged '' junk bond mutual funds , the publicly traded funds
that make a habit of taking out loans to buy extra junk .
It 's a good strategy in a rising market , where a 25 % leveraged portfolio in effect allows investors to have 125 % of their money working for them .
The strategy boosts current yield by putting more bonds into the portfolio .
Trouble is , junk bond prices have been weak for months .
Thus , the leverage has amplified the funds ' portfolio losses .
And shares of leveraged junk funds
this year have been clobbered even harder than the junk bonds they hold .
`` That 's really where the leverage hurt , '' says Thomas Herzfeld , a Miami-based investment manager
who specializes in closed-end funds .
`` Share prices performed even worse than the funds ' asset values because fear has taken hold '' in the junk market , he says .
Leverage is never a problem for the traditional `` open end '' mutual funds , which are n't publicly traded and are n't allowed to use leverage at all .
Leverage is used only by some of the closed-end funds .
The usual maneuver is to borrow against the portfolio value or issue preferred stock , using the proceeds to buy additional bonds .
The fallout for investors lately has been painful .
Consider
the New America High Income Fund .
With a leveraged position of about 45 % , the fund 's share price has plunged 28.5 % so far this year .
That 's worse than the price drop sustained by the bonds in its portfolio , whose total return ( bond-price changes plus interest ) has amounted to a negative 6.08 % .
Such problems may not be over .
Leveraged funds in particular `` are still extremely vulnerable , because we 're still at the beginning of problems in the junk market , '' says George Foot , a managing partner at Newgate Management Associates in Northampton , Mass .
Many investors are unaware their funds have borrowed to speculate in such a risky market .
`` If someone actually sat down and thought about what
they were being sold , '' says Gerald Perritt , editor of the Mutual Fund Letter in Chicago , they might shy away .
In a typical leverage strategy , a fund tries to capture the spread between what
it costs to borrow and the higher return on the bonds
it buys with the borrowed money .
If the market surges , holders can make that much more profit ; the leverage effectively acts as an interest-free margin account for investors .
But when the market moves against the fund , investors lose more than other junk holders because the market decline is magnified by the amount
the fund is leveraged .
Fund managers , for their part , defend their use of leverage .
Carl Ericson , who runs the Colonial Intermediate High Income Fund , says the fund 's 25 % leverage has jacked up its interest income .
`` As long as I am borrowing at 9.9 % and each { bond } yields over that , it enhances the yield , '' he maintains .
Mr. Ericson says he tries to offset the leverage by diversifying the fund 's portfolio .
Yet some funds have pulled in their horns .
New America High Income Fund recently said that it plans to reduce its leverage position by buying back $ 5 million in preferred stock and notes from investors .
The fund made a similar move earlier this year .
`` We are trying to increase our flexibility , '' says Ellen E. Terry , a vice president at Ostrander Capital Management , the fund 's investment adviser .
She declined to elaborate and would n't disclose the fund 's recent purchases , sales or cash position .
Ms. Terry did say the fund 's recent performance `` illustrates what happens in a leveraged product '' when the market does n't cooperate .
`` When the market turns around , '' she says , `` it will give a nice picture '' of how leverage can help performance .
Several leveraged funds do n't want to cut the amount
they borrow because it would slash the income
they pay shareholders , fund officials said .
But a few funds have taken other defensive steps .
Some have raised their cash positions to record levels .
High cash positions help buffer
a fund when the market falls .
Prospect Street High Income Portfolio , for instance , now holds about 15 % in cash and equivalents , nearly quintuple the amount
it held earlier this year , says John Frabotta , portfolio co-manager .
He says the fund , which is 40 % leveraged , has maintained a `` substantial cushion '' between its borrowing costs and the yields of the portfolio 's bonds .
`` I do n't want to be in a position to have to sell , '' Mr. Frabotta says .
Other funds have recently sold weak junk bonds to raise cash .
At the 50%-leveraged Zenith Income Fund , portfolio manager John Bianchi recently dumped Mesa Petroleum , Wickes and Horsehead Industries , among others , to raise his cash position to a record 15 % .
`` That 's a problem because cash is n't earning us
very much money , '' Mr. Bianchi says .
He concedes : `` This is the most difficult market that I 've been involved in .
Because of the recent junk-market turmoil , the fund is considering investing in other issues instead , including mortgage-backed bonds .
`` We 're looking at the leverage factor
every day , '' says Robert Moore , president of Bernstein-Macaulay Inc. , a Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. unit and the fund 's adviser .
`` At some point , if we are unable to cover our leveraged cost -- and at the moment
we 're right on it -- we 're going to have to make a move .
In the aftermath of the Beijing massacre on June 4 , economists advanced wildly divergent views on how Hong Kong would be affected .
Among the most upbeat was BT Brokerage ( Asia ) Ltd .
In a June 5 reaction , the Bankers Trust Co. unit proclaimed the economy `` shockproof .
Others were more cautious .
In a July analysis titled `` From Euphoria to Despair , '' W.I. Carr ( Far East ) Ltd. , another securities firm , said that eroding confidence might undermine future economic development .
Today , with business activity in Hong Kong staggering along at an uneven pace , the economy
itself seems locked in a struggle between hope and fear .
Manufacturers have survived the turmoil in China largely unscathed .
Signs of revival seem evident in Hong Kong 's hard-hit hotel sector .
But in the stock and real-estate markets , activity remains spotty even though prices have regained much of their lost ground .
Waning demand reported by importers , retailers and even fancy restaurants all reinforce a profile of a community
that is sharply tightening its belt .
As many economists and businessmen see it , those incongruities underscore a paradox
that seems likely to bedevil the economy throughout the 1990s .
That paradox is Hong Kong 's economically rewarding yet politically perilous relationship with China .
As a model of capitalist efficiency on southern China 's doorstep , Hong Kong 's prospects look good .
China 's land and labor offer inexpensive alternatives to local industry .
China-bound freight streams through the territory 's port .
In the decade since the communist nation emerged from isolation , its burgeoning trade with the West has lifted Hong Kong 's status as a regional business center .
These benefits seem secure despite China 's current economic and political troubles .
But to Hong Kong , China is n't purely business .
It is also the sovereign power that , come 1997 , will take over this British colony .
China 's leaders have promised generous liberties for post-1997 Hong Kong .
That promise sounds shaky now that those same leaders have fallen back on Marxist dogma and brute force to crush their nation 's democracy movement .
Outflows of people and capital from Hong Kong have been growing since the sovereignty issue first arose in the early 1980s .
A widely held assumption
all along has been that , given its robust economy , Hong Kong will be able to attract sufficient foreign money and talent to comfortably offset the outflows .
With interest in emigration and investment abroad soaring since June 4 , that assumption no longer seems so safe .
Investment and emigration plans take time to come to fruition .
Only four months have passed since the Beijing massacre , and few are prepared to predict its ultimate impact .
The only consensus is that more money and people may leave Hong Kong than had been thought likely .
This expected blow has cast a pall over the economy 's prospects .
The question , as many people see it , is how long such uncertainty will last .
Maureen Fraser , an economist with W.I. Carr , a subsidiary of France 's Banque Indosuez , believes that the territory may not be able to regain its momentum until some time after 1997 .
It may experience an upswing or two in between .
But with local investors shaken by China 's political and economic turmoil , she says , a genuine recovery may not arrive until Hong Kong can prove itself secure under Chinese sovereignty .
`` Investors have to accept the possibility of a significant slowdown in economic activity in the runup to 1997 , '' she says .
`` Over the next few years , I would advise caution .
In a soon-to-be published book on the territory , a political economist , Miron Mushkat , has derived three future scenarios from interviews with 41 Hong Kong government officials and businessmen .
Nearly half of them argue that Hong Kong 's uneasy relationship with China will constrain -- though not inhibit -- long-term economic growth .
The rest are split roughly between optimists
who expect Hong Kong to hum along as before and pessimists
who foresee irreparable chaos .
The interviews took place two years ago .
Since the China crisis erupted , Mr. Mushkat says , the scenario as depicted by the middle-of-the-road group bears a remarkable resemblance to the difficulties Hong Kong currently faces .
The consensus of this group , which
he dubs `` realists , '' is that the local economy will grow through the 1990s at annual rates averaging between 3 % and 5 % .
Such a pace of growth , though respectable for mature industrialized economies , would be unusually slow for Hong Kong .
Only twice since the 1960s has annual gross domestic product growth here fallen below 5 % for two or more consecutive years .
The first instance occurred in 1967-68 , when China 's Cultural Revolution triggered bloody street rioting in the colony .
The other came in 1974-75 from the combined shock of world recession and a severe local stock market crash .
During the past 10 years , Hong Kong 's economic growth has averaged 8.3 % annually .
Given Hong Kong 's record , Mr. Mushkat 's `` realists '' might have sounded unduly conservative when the interviews took place two years ago .
Under the current circumstances , he says , their scenario no longer seems unrealistic .
`` The city could lose some of its entrepreneurial flavor .
It could lose some of its dynamism , '' says Mr. Mushkat , a director of Baring Securities ( Hong Kong ) Ltd. , a unit of Britain 's Barings PLC .
`` It does n't have to be a disaster .
It just means that Hong Kong would become a less exciting place .
Going by official forecasts of GDP , which measures the colony 's output of goods and services , minus foreign income , Mr. Mushkat 's `` realists '' seem relatively close to the mark .
After taking into account
the fallout from the China crisis , the government has projected 1989 GDP growth of 5 % .
The updated forecast , published Aug. 25 , compares with an earlier forecast of 6 % published March 1 and a 7.4 % rate achieved in
Sir Piers Jacobs , Hong Kong 's financial secretary , says a further downward revision may be justified unless the economy stages a more convincing rally .
`` We are n't looking at anything like a doomsday scenario , '' he says .
`` But clearly we 're entering a difficult period .
Many factors besides a dread of 1997 will have a bearing on Hong Kong 's economy .
One concerns Japanese investors .
Barely visible on Hong Kong 's property scene in 1985 , by last year Japan had become the top foreign investor , spending $ 602 million .
The market has grown relatively quiet since the China crisis .
But if the Japanese return in force , their financial might could compensate to some extent for local investors ' waning commitment .
Another -- and critical -- factor is the U.S. , Hong Kong 's biggest export market .
Even before the China crisis , weak U.S. demand was slowing local economic growth .
Conversely , strong consumer spending in the U.S. two years ago helped propel the local economy at more than twice its current rate .
Indeed , a few economists maintain that global forces will continue to govern Hong Kong 's economic rhythm .
Once external conditions , such as U.S. demand , swing in the territory 's favor , they argue , local businessmen will probably overcome their 1997 worries and continue doing business as usual .
But economic arguments , however solid , wo n't necessarily impress Hong Kong 's 5.7 million people .
Many are refugees , having fled China 's unending cycles of political repression and poverty since the Communist Party took power in 1949 .
As a result , many of those now planning to leave Hong Kong ca n't easily be swayed by momentary improvements in the colony 's political and economic climate .
Emigration applications soared in 1985 , when Britain and China ratified their accord on Hong Kong 's future .
In 1987 , Hong Kong 's most prosperous year for a decade , 30,000 left , up 58 % from the previous year .
Last year , 45,000 went .
The government predicts that annual outflows will level off over the next few years at as much as 60,000 -- a projection
that is widely regarded as unrealistically low .
A large number of those leaving are managers and professionals .
While no one professes to know the exact cost of such a `` brain drain '' to the economy , hardly anyone doubts that it poses a threat .
`` When the economy loses a big portion of its work force
that also happens to include its most productive members , economic growth is bound to be affected , '' says Anthong Wong , an economist with Hang Seng Bank .
As program trading comes under renewed attack for causing stock market gyrations , a few people on Wall Street say it is time to consider extreme measures .
The real answer to curbing wild swings in stock prices , they say , might be to curb or even abolish stock-index futures .
A stock-index future is a contract to buy or sell the market value of a basket of stocks , such as the Standard & Poor 's 500-stock index .
Since stock futures were created in 1982 , trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and other exchanges has boomed to the point where trading in stock-index futures rivals that in the stocks themselves .
The conventional view , as voiced by Goldman , Sachs & Co. partner Fischer Black , is that stocks and `` derivatives '' such as futures and options `` form a single market , and that derivatives make it
a more liquid market .
But increasingly , people are questioning that view , and the critics include some of the country 's most successful investors .
Warren Buffett has been on record as opposing stock-index futures since their inception in 1982 .
And Mario Gabelli , another star in the investing world , says , `` My gut says the negatives of futures and synthetics far outweigh the benefits .
Like others , Mr. Gabelli says that if futures cause investors to lose confidence in stocks , they will move away from stocks -- as many have already done .
And those
who remain , he says `` will demand a higher return and over time raise the cost of capital to companies .
Essentially , the critics of stock-index futures fall into two camps .
One group says the futures contribute to stock market volatility ; the other contends that futures are a sideshow of speculation
that detracts from the stock market 's basic function of raising capital .
`` Before futures , '' says New York investor Michael Harkins , `` you actually had to pay attention to whether the thing
you were buying had any intrinsic value .
While it was once expected that futures would mimic stock prices , traders now routinely check the futures markets in Chicago before they buy or sell stocks .
When Chicago futures prices jump up or down , the New York Stock Exchange follows .
On Tuesday , for instance , the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 80 points in little more than an hour .
Then , in the space of a 20-minute coffee break , the average rallied almost all of the way back .
Paul Lesutis , who manages more than $ 3 billion of investments at Provident Capital Management Inc. , blames futures markets for leading the way .
`` The fundamentals do n't change in an hour , '' he says .
`` I think they should close down the futures exchange and then we could get back to investing .
Index arbitrage -- the rapid-fire buying and selling of stocks offset with opposite trades in futures -- is frequently blamed for adding to stock market volatility .
Although index arbitrage is said to add liquidity to markets , John Bachmann , managing partner of Edward D. Jones , says too much liquidity is n't a good thing
`` The kind of instant liquidity
that is implied by index futures is that you can buy a portfolio over two years and get out in one day .
It 's too disruptive , '' he says .
`` It is n't investing .
But stock-index futures have plenty of support .
Defenders say futures make markets more efficient and provide ways for investors to reduce risks .
They note that stocks experienced volatile swings long before futures .
And , defenders say , few people complain about futures when stock prices are rising .
Louis Margolis , managing director in charge of equity options and futures at Salomon Inc. , says that trading baskets of stocks began in the 1970s , a decade before the advent of futures .
Futures , he says , merely cut down on trading costs .
He says `` blaming futures is like blaming the messenger .
'' Since stock-index arbitrage merely narrows the gap between prices in the futures and stock markets , it ca n't add to volatility , he says .
Futures `` do n't need defending , '' says Andrew Yemma , a spokesman for the Chicago Mercantile Exchange , which trades the S&P 500 , by far the largest stock-index futures contract .
Despite the current outcry over stock market volatility , few people expect stock futures to disappear .
For one thing , the Chicago futures exchanges have political and financial clout -- including many friends in Congress .
And traders say that futures have become an accepted part of the financial landscape .
`` All life is about change -- either you adapt or die , '' says one Chicago futures trader .
`` If futures are n't permitted here , we 'll take it to Australia or Tokyo .
Average daily volume in S&P 500 futures last year was 44,877 contracts .
Based on yesterday 's closing price of the S&P , the average value of one day 's trading amounts to $ 7.6 billion .
By contrast , average dollar volume on the Big Board last year was $ 5.3 billion .
Many investment managers say futures are useful as a way to hedge portfolios .
If managers fear that the overall stock market will fall , but want to continue owning stocks , they can hold on to specific stocks and sell a corresponding amount of futures contracts .
And although criticism of futures generally comes from Wall Street , one Chicago futures trader notes that brokerage firms rely on futures as hedging tools when they buy and sell big blocks of stocks from institutions .
One reason futures are said to add volatility is that -- unlike in stocks -- people can speculate in futures with little money down .
Margin requirements for speculators on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange are currently about 7 % .
`` For $ 10 million , you can move $ 100 million of stocks , '' a specialist on the Big Board gripes .
`` That gives futures traders
a lot more power .
'' By contrast , an investor in stocks must put up 50 % in cash .
Some critics say futures encourage people to think of stocks as a single commodity , rather than as investments in individual businesses .
Thus , they say , futures inhibit the basic purpose of the stock market : to accurately price securities so that capital and investment flows where it 's needed most .
The S&P 500 index futures `` transferred the identity of 500 stocks into one unit - making them
a simple commodity to trade , '' says George Kegler , senior vice president at A. Webster Dougherty in Philadelphia .
`` It took away the need to know the bad third-quarter report of IBM , for example , '' Mr. Kegler says .
Of course , portfolio trading -- the increasingly common practice of buying or selling baskets of actual stocks -- also treats stocks as homogenous commodities .
`` There is a class of investor
that wants to be exposed '' to the whole market , says Sandip Bhagat , assistant vice president at Travelers Investment Management Co .
The S&P futures are merely a `` cheaper and quicker '' way to get access to all 500 stocks , he says .
The Big Board yesterday began trading in its own basket trading vehicle representing the S&P 500 stocks .
But owning index futures is n't the same as owning the underlying stocks .
Stockholders , as a group , can win , because they own a share of corporate earnings , which can grow and boost stock prices .
Futures , on the other hand , are a zero sum game -- a market for making side bets about the direction of stock prices .
`` You do n't own anything , '' says Stephen Boesel , a money manager for T. Rowe Price in Baltimore .
`` You 're making a pure bet on the market .
Robert L. Bernstein , chairman and president of Random House Inc. , announced his resignation from the publishing house
he has run for 23 years .
A successor was n't named , which fueled speculation that Mr. Bernstein may have clashed with S.I. Newhouse Jr. , whose family company , Advance Publications Inc. , owns Random House .
Abrupt departures are n't unheard of within the Newhouse empire .
In an interview , Mr. Bernstein said his departure `` evolved out of discussions with Si Newhouse and that 's the decision
I reached .
'' He declined to elaborate , other than to say , `` It just seemed the right thing to do at this minute .
Sometimes you just go with your gut .
'' Mr. Bernstein said he will stay until Dec. 31 and work with his successor , who is to be named soon .
Mr. Newhouse , meanwhile , insisted that he is n't unhappy with Mr. Bernstein or the performance of Random House , the largest trade publishing house in the U.S .
The company said the publisher 's annual sales volume increased to $ 800 million from $ 40 million during Mr. Bernstein 's tenure .
`` Bob has handled the extraordinary growth of the company quite brilliantly , '' said Mr. Newhouse .
`` The company is doing well , it 's stable , it 's got good people .
Bob has an agenda and this seemed like the natural time .
Publishing officials believe that while Random House has enjoyed spectacular growth and has smoothly integrated many acquisitions in recent years , some of the bigger ones have n't been absorbed so easily .
Crown Publishing Group , acquired last year , is said to be turning in disappointing results .
As a private company , Random House does n't report its earnings .
Mr. Bernstein , who succeeded Bennett Cerf , has been only the second president of Random House since it was founded in 1925 .
Speculation on his successor centers on a number of division heads at the house .
Possible candidates include Susan Petersen , president of Ballantine\/Del Rey\/Fawcett , Random House 's huge and successful paperback division .
Some say Anthony Cheetham , head of a recently acquired British company , Century Hutchinson , could be chosen .
There is also speculation that Mr. Newhouse could bring in a powerhouse businessman or another Newhouse family member to run the business side , in combination with a publishing executive like Robert Gottlieb , who left Random House 's Alfred A. Knopf to run the New Yorker , also owned by the Newhouse family .
Not included on the most-likely-successor list are Joni Evans , recruited two years ago to be publisher of adult trade books for Random House , and Sonny Mehta , president of the prestigious Alfred A. Knopf unit .
When Ms. Evans took her
job , several important divisions
that had reported to her predecessor were n't included partly because she did n't wish to be a full-time administrator .
Mr. Mehta is widely viewed as a brilliant editor but a less-than-brilliant administrator and his own departure was rumored recently .
Mr. Bernstein , a tall , energetic man
who is widely respected as a publishing executive , has spent much of his time in recent years on human rights issues .

Criticism in the U.S. over recent Japanese acquisitions is looming ever larger in the two countries ' relations .
Officials from both
nations say the U.S. public 's skittishness about Japanese investment could color a second round of bilateral economic talks scheduled for next week in Washington .
Not that Washington and Tokyo disagree on the Japanese acquisitions ; indeed , each has come out in favor of unfettered investment in the U.S .
Where they disagree is on the subject of U.S. direct investment in Japan .
The U.S. wants the removal of what
it perceives as barriers to investment ; Japan denies there are real barriers .
The heated talk stirred up by recent Japanese investments in the U.S. is focusing attention on the differences in investment climate , even though it 's only one of many subjects to be covered in the bilateral talks , known as the Structural Impediments Initiative .
The Japanese `` should see this rhetoric as a signal of the need for a change in their own economy , '' says Charles Dallara , U.S. assistant Treasury secretary , who has been in Tokyo
this week informally discussing the impending negotiations with government and business leaders .
`` We have a long history of maintaining an open direct-investment policy , '' Mr. Dallara says .
`` U.S. investors should have a greater opportunity at direct investment '' in Japan .
The Japanese fret openly about the U.S. public 's rancor .
One clear sign of Japan 's nervousness came this week , when a spokesman for Japan 's Foreign Ministry devoted nearly all of a regular , half-hour briefing for foreign journalists to the subject of recent Japanese investments in the U.S .
`` We believe that it is vitally important for those Japanese business interests { in the U.S .
} to be more aware of the emotions and concerns of the American people , '' said the spokesman , Taizo Watanabe .
At the same time , though , he chastised the media for paying such close attention to Japanese investment when other foreign countries , notably Britain , are acquiring more American assets .
Fears that Japanese investors are buying up America have escalated sharply in the past several weeks , with Sony Corp. 's purchase of Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. from Coca-Cola Co. and Mitsubishi Estate Co. 's acquisition of a 51 % holding in Rockefeller Group , the owner of some of midtown Manhattan 's most exclusive real estate .
Even before those moves added fuel , the fires of discontent had been well stoked by the highly publicized experience in Japan of one U.S. investor , T. Boone Pickens Jr .
The Texas oilman has acquired a 26.2 % stake valued at more than $ 1.2 billion in an automotive-lighting company , Koito Manufacturing Co .
But he has failed to gain any influence at the company .
Koito has refused to grant Mr. Pickens seats on its board , asserting he is a greenmailer trying to pressure Koito 's other shareholders into buying him out at a profit .
Mr. Pickens made considerable political hay with his troubles in Japan .
The Senate Finance Committee , chaired by a fellow Texan , Democratic Sen. Lloyd Bentsen , last month urged U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills to use Mr. Pickens 's experience in talks with Tokyo `` to highlight this problem facing Americans
who seek access to the Japanese capital markets .
While Mr. Dallara and Japanese officials say the question of investors ' access to the U.S. and Japanese markets may get a disproportionate share of the public 's attention , a number of other important economic issues will be on the table at next week 's talks .
Among them are differences in savings and investment rates , corporate structures and management , and government spending .
Each side has a litany of recommendations for the other .
The U.S. says it is anxious for results .
`` We feel very strongly that we really need action across the full range of issues we 've identified , and we need it by next spring , '' Mr. Dallara says .
sides have agreed that the talks will be most successful if negotiators start by focusing on the areas
that can be most easily changed .
But they have n't clarified what
those might be .
After the first set of meetings two months ago , some U.S. officials complained that Japan had n't come up with specific changes
it was prepared to make .
The Japanese retort that the first round was too early to make concessions .
`` Just to say the distribution system is wrong does n't mean anything , '' says a Ministry of International Trade and Industry official .
`` We need to clarify what exactly is wrong with it .
That process of sorting out specifics is likely to take time , the Japanese say , no matter how badly the U.S. wants quick results .
For instance , at the first meeting
the two sides could n't even agree on basic data used in price discussions .
Since then , a team of about 15 MITI and U.S. Commerce Department officials have crossed the globe gauging consumer prices .
By Monday , they hope to have a sheaf of documents
sides can trust .
`` Little by little , there is progress , '' says the MITI official .
`` Both
sides are taking action .

International Business Machines Corp. said it agreed to let Motorola Inc. participate in a semiconductor research project as part of its effort to bolster the U.S. semiconductor industry .
IBM , which made the announcement at the dedication of a research center here , said it invited many other companies to participate as well , including some from Europe .
Jack Kuehler , IBM 's president , said IBM is also considering letting other companies participate in additional semiconductor work but declined to be more specific .
IBM , which said a year ago it was inviting companies to participate in some semiconductor work , has become far more open about its technology as it has tried to rally U.S. industry to head off the Japanese , who now dominate the market for dynamic random access memory chips .
While IBM , Armonk , N.Y. , makes the bulk of the DRAMs
it uses , it does n't make the equipment needed to produce those chips .
And IBM worries that the Japanese will take over that equipment market , too , unless U.S. semiconductor companies produce enough memory chips here to keep U.S. equipment makers healthy .
Failure of U.S. equipment makers , IBM fears , would leave it dependent on many of the Japanese companies
that compete with it in other parts of the market .
IBM also said it expects to benefit from the expertise
that Motorola and other companies can bring to bear on the difficult problems involved in semiconductor manufacturing .
IBM already participates in one industrywide effort to improve semiconductor-manufacturing techniques .
IBM said it expects industrywide efforts to become prevalent because semiconductor manufacturing has become so expensive .
A state-of-the-art plant cost $ 40 million in the mid-1970s but costs $ 500 million today because the technology is so complex .
And IBM said it expects the costs to continue climbing .
IBM , which said Motorola is paying just a nominal fee to cover the 21-month agreement , acknowledged some companies had turned down its invitation to join in .
But it said that was mainly because the project may not bear fruit until the mid-1990s .
IBM said it thought more companies would become interested as the project progresses .
The project involving Motorola concerns a technique , called X-ray lithography , that figures to be crucial to future generations of memory chips .
Currently , chips are produced by shining light through a mask to produce an image on the chip , much as a camera produces an image on film .
But details on chips must now be extraordinarily fine , and the wavelengths of even ultraviolet light are long enough so that the images they draw may be too blurry -- much as someone using a wide paintbrush could produce a broad line but would have trouble painting a thin one .
X-rays , by contrast , travel straighter and can be focused more tightly than light .
X-rays have problems , too .
They can make the masks brittle and can pass through material
they 're not supposed to .
But , assuming those problems can be overcome , they should allow for memory chips
that could approach one billion bits of information -- 250 times as much as is contained in the four-megabit chips
that are just reaching the market and a million times
what was possible in the mid-1970s .
Senate Democrats
who favor cutting the capital-gains tax are n't ready to line up behind the leading Senate proposal .
Their reluctance to support the proposal is another blow to the capital-gains cut , which has had a roller-coaster existence since the beginning of the year , when it was considered dead and then suddenly revived and was passed by the House .
Nevertheless , Oregon Sen. Bob Packwood , the ranking GOP member on the tax-writing Senate Finance Committee , last night introduced his plan as an amendment to a pending measure authorizing U.S. aid for Poland and Hungary .
Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell ( D. , Maine ) was confident he had enough votes to block the maneuver on procedural grounds , perhaps as soon as today .
Mr. Packwood all but conceded defeat , telling Mr. Mitchell : `` I sense at this stage
you may have the votes .
The two lawmakers sparred in a highly personal fashion , violating usual Senate decorum .
Their tone was good-natured , with Mr. Packwood saying he intended to offer the proposal again and again on future legislation and Sen. Mitchell saying he intended to use procedural means to block it again and again .
Although the proposal , authored by Mr. Packwood and Sen. William Roth ( R. , Del. ) , appears to have general backing by Republicans , their votes are n't sufficient to pass it .
And Democrats , who are under increasing pressure from their leaders to reject the gains-tax cut , are finding reasons to say no , at least for now .
A major reason is that they believe the Packwood-Roth plan would lose buckets of revenue over the long run .
The Packwood-Roth proposal would reduce the tax depending on how long an asset was held .
It also would create a new individual retirement account
that would shield from taxation
the appreciation on investments made for a wide variety of purposes , including retirement , medical expenses , first-home purchases and tuition .
`` A number of us are not going to touch capital gains , IRAs or anything else unless it contributes to deficit-reduction , '' said Sen. Charles Robb ( D. , Va. ) , who is one of the 10 to 20 Democrats
the Bush administration believes might favor giving preferential treatment to capital gains .
President Bush has been hearing this kind of opposition first hand during meetings over the past two days with Democratic senators at the White House .
And at a luncheon meeting Tuesday of Democratic senators , there was outspoken opposition to cutting the capital-gains tax
this year , according to participants .
The trend is making advocates of the tax cut less optimistic about success .
`` There is a one-out-of-three shot of getting it
this year , '' said Sen. David Boren of Oklahoma , a leading Democratic proponent of cutting the capital-gains tax .
He called the battle `` uphill .
Other Democrats
who favor a capital-gains cut are even more pessimistic .
`` There will be no capital-gains bill
this year , '' said Sen. Dale Bumpers ( D. , Ark .
`` I 'm probably not going to vote for any capital-gains proposal .
The IRA portion ( of the Packwood-Roth plan ) is irresponsible .
Another significant factor in the capitalgains debate is the extent to which
it has become a purely political battle between President Bush and Senate Majority Leader Mitchell .
Mr. Mitchell has made clear to his wavering colleagues that the issue is important to him personally .
Today , Sen. Mitchell and other leading Democrats plan to turn up the heat again by holding a news conference to bash the proposal .
Estimates requested by Sen. Mitchell from the Congressional Joint Taxation Committee show that the richest 100 taxpayers got an average benefit from the capital-gains differential of $ 13 million each in 1985 , the last year for which figures are available .
White House officials acknowledged yesterday that Democrats still are reluctant to publicly express support for the Packwood-Roth capital gains proposal because they are loath to buck Sen. Mitchell .
As a result , the officials said they are open to making a variety of deals with Senate Democrats to win their support for a capital-gains tax cut .
Democrats asked in this week for discussions with President Bush have suggested ways of `` tinkering '' with the Packwood-Roth proposal , suggesting an interest in looking for a modified version
they can back , one official said .
In addition , White House aides think that there are numerous other important measures Democrats badly wanted passed -- such as the scaling back of a controversial catastrophic health-care plan for the elderly -- that might provide the president leverage in cutting deals with Democrats .
A capital-gains tax cut might be paired with such measures to help ensure passage .
Other possibilities include a child-care initiative and an increase in the minimum wage .
If they ca n't secure immediate passage of a capital-gains plan , administration officials also are n't ruling out making a deal with Congress to put off a vote until a firm date in the future , even next year .
But the officials insist that such a deal on a future vote would have to apply to both
the House and the Senate .

The Venice city council is battling plans to tap huge gas fields off the coast that it says will speed up the city 's slow sinking into its lagoon .
AGIP , the state-owned energy giant , made the announcement about the gas field last month .
Located six miles northeast of Venice , the field contains 875 billion cubic feet of methane gas - one-tenth of Italy 's reserves .
Alarmed councilors say the project could jeopardize costly efforts to stop , or slow down , the subsidence
that makes Venice subject to regular and destructive flooding .
The council unanimously opposed the idea of AGIP pumping out the methane gas and swiftly appealed to the company and to Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti , who has yet to reply .
AGIP refused to reconsider and says drilling is due to start early next year .
`` It 's unlikely extracting the gas will cause subsidence , '' says a spokeswoman .

The prices of corn futures contracts jumped amid rumors that the Soviet Union is keeping up its dizzying October buying binge of U.S. corn .
Those rumors were confirmed after the end of trading yesterday when the U.S. Agriculture Department announced that the Soviets had bought 1.2 million metric tons of U.S. corn , bringing their U.S. corn purchases confirmed so far this month to about five million metric tons .
In trading at the Chicago Board of Trade , the corn contract for December delivery jumped 5.75 cents
a bushel to settle at $ 2.44
a bushel .
The Soviet purchases are close to exceeding what some analysts had expected the Soviet Union to buy this fall , the season in which
it usually buys much of the corn
it imports from the U.S .
That pace is causing some analysts to speculate that the Soviet Union might soon purchase as much as another two million metric tons .
One sign that more Soviet purchases are possible is that U.S. grain companies yesterday bought an unusually large amount of corn futures contracts .
That sometimes signals that they are laying plans to export corn .
By some estimates , several grain companies combined bought contracts for the possession of roughly one million metric tons of corn .
By buying futures contracts , these companies attempt to protect themselves from swings in the price of the corn that they are obligated to deliver .
Rumors of Soviet interest also pushed up the prices of soybean futures contracts .
Among other things , the Agriculture Department is widely thought to be mulling whether to subsidize the sale of soybean oil to the Soviet Union .
On top of all this , corn and soybean prices rose on reports that the Midwest harvest was disrupted by a freakishly early snow storm
that dumped several inches in parts of Indiana and Ohio .
The harvest delays , however , are expected to be temporary .
Balmy temperatures are forecast for next week , said Robert Lekberg , an analyst at Farmers Grain & Livestock Corp. , Chicago .
Many farmers used the jump in prices to sell their recently harvested crop to grain elevator companies .
The heavy selling by farmers helped to damp the price rally .
Wheat futures prices rose slightly .
PRECIOUS METALS : Futures prices declined .
A number of developments were negatively interpreted by traders .
December delivery gold fell $ 1.80
an ounce to $ 370.60 .
December silver eased 2.7 cents
an ounce to $ 5.133 .
January platinum was down $ 3.60
an ounce at $ 491.10 .
One price-depressing development was the lower-than-expected increase of only 0.2 % in the consumer price index for September , an analyst said .
He noted that the `` core inflation rate , '' which excludes food and energy , was also low at 0.2 % .
Other news
that weighed on the market : Initial unemployment claims rose by 62,000 last week ; American Telephone & Telegraph Co. will reduce its managerial staff by 15,000 through attrition ; the oil market turned weaker ; there was n't any investor demand for bullion ; and the dollar strengthened during the day , putting pressure on gold .
Also , the analyst said , economic circumstances are such that both South Africa and the Soviet Union , the principal gold and platinum producers , are being forced to continue selling the metals .
Both are in great need of foreign exchange , and South Africa is also under pressure to meet foreign loan commitments , he said .
`` Putting it
all together , we have a negative scenario
that does n't look like it will improve overnight , '' he said .
COPPER : Futures prices recovered in quiet trading .
The December contract rose 1.50 cents
a pound to $ 1.2795 .
That contract fell a total of 5.75 cents during the first three days of this week , mostly in reaction to last Friday 's stock market plunge , which prompted concern that it might signal a similar sharp slowing of the U.S. economy and thus reduced demand for copper , a leading industrial metal .
In recent days , however , there has been increased purchasing of copper in London , an analyst said .
Some of this buying was by Japan , which has had its supplies sharply reduced by long production stoppages at the Bougainville mine in Papua New Guinea , Highland Valley mine in British Columbia , and the Cananea mine in Mexico , which are major shippers to Japan .
The increasing likelihood that Cananea and Highland Valley will soon return to production may have cut some of that purchasing , but even if any of these mines begin operating soon , their output wo n't be significant until at least the end of the year , analysts note .
So , one analyst said , even though the long-term production problems may be easing , there will still be a significant need for copper over the next three months , when inventories will remain relatively low .
ENERGY : Crude oil prices ended mixed .
West Texas Intermediate for November delivery fell 14 cents
a barrel to $ 20.42 .
But so-called outer month contracts finished higher .
For instance , December contracts for WTI rose 17 cents to $ 20.42 .
Most energy futures opened lower , following Wednesday 's market downturn .
But a flurry of late trading yesterday beefed up prices .
Heating oil and gasoline futures ended higher as well .
Sea Containers Ltd. , in a long-awaited move to repel a hostile takeover bid , said it will sell $ 1.1 billion of assets and use some of the proceeds to buy about 50 % of its common shares for $ 70 apiece .
Together with the 3.6 million shares currently controlled by management , subsidiaries and directors , the completed tender offer would give Sea Containers
a controlling stake .
Describing itself as `` asset rich , '' Sea Containers said it will move immediately to sell two ports , various ferries , ferry services , containers , and other investments .
Of the proceeds , $ 500 million will be used to fund its tender offer .
Sea Containers added that the recapitalization plan will reduce its debt by more than $ 500 million .
The company , which has 13.8 million common shares outstanding , said in mid-June that it was considering a restructuring to ward off a hostile takeover attempt by two European shipping concerns .
In late May , Stena Holding AG and Tiphook PLC , launched a $ 50-a-share , or $ 777 million , tender offer for the Hamilton , Bermuda-based Sea Containers .
In mid-August , the companies , through their jointly owned holding company , Temple Holdings Ltd. , sweetened the offer to $ 63
Officials for Temple declined to comment .
News of the restructuring plan sent Sea Containers ' shares up $ 1 to $ 62 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading .
Walter Kirchberger , an analyst with PaineWebber Inc. , said that offering holders
a higher , $ 70-a-share price is `` a fairly effective method of blocking '' the Stena-Tiphook bid .
Michael Carstens , an analyst with Tucker Anthony & R.L. Day , added that the sale of assets would allow Sea Containers to focus on its core container businesses .
For holders
who decide not to tender their shares , Sea Containers will issue one share of preferred stock with a stated value of $ 25 , plus a cash dividend on the common stock .
The company said its directors , management and subsidiaries will remain long-term investors and wo n't tender any of their shares under the offer .
Sea Containers said the offer will proceed after the Bermuda Supreme Court lifts or modifies an interim injunction restraining the company from buying its shares .
That injunction resulted from litigation between Temple and Sea Containers last May .
The company said the court has indicated it will make a decision on or about Nov. 27 .
Sea Containers will soon set a date for its annual shareholder meeting to seek holder approval for the offer .
Procter & Gamble Co. and Noxell Corp. said they received early termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act regarding the proposed $ 1.4 billion merger of Noxell into P&G .

P&G , Cincinnati , agreed to exchange 0.272 share of its common stock for each share of Noxell common and Class B stock , a total of about 11 million P&G shares .
The transaction would mark the entry of P&G into cosmetics .
The company already markets a wide range of detergents , food , household and health-care products .

Two Japanese scientists said they discovered an antibody that , in laboratory test-tube experiments , kills AIDS-infected cells while preserving healthy cells .
If further experiments are successful , the work would represent a major advance in research on acquired immune deficiency syndrome .
The drug AZT , the only treatment currently on the market , claims only to help stop the spread of AIDS , not to cure it .
But several analysts and Japanese scientists familiar with the study , which was announced at a conference in Nagoya yesterday , expressed skepticism over the significance of the results .
And the researchers themselves acknowledged they still must do much more work before they can say whether the treatment would actually cure humans .
Shin Yonehara , a research scientist at the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science , said the antibody
he discovered works by recognizing an antigen called a Fas-antigen , which is characteristic of an infected cell .
The antibody then kills the cell .
Dr. Yonehara and his partner , Nobuyuki Kobayashi of Yamaguchi University , said their experiments showed that the antibody wiped out an average of 60 % of AIDS-infected cells within three days .
In some of the experiments , it killed almost all the infected cells , the researchers said .
Meanwhile , fewer than 10 % of the healthy cells were killed .
The two said they must still do more laboratory tests , then experiment on animals .
They said they hoped to conduct tests on human patients in the U.S. by late next year .
Japan does n't have enough AIDS patients to do significant experimentation in that country , they said .
The announcement got wide exposure in the Japanese media , and even moved some pharmaceutical stocks yesterday .
But Takashi Kitamura , director of the biology department at Japan 's National Institute of Health and secretary of the government 's AIDS-research center , said , `` I 'm not so optimistic of its future use in therapeutic methods .
'' He said some infected cells may not have the relevant antigen and so would n't be killed even after exposure to the antibody .
`` The results seem to be very premature , '' said Mitsuru Miyata , editor of Nikkei Biotechnology , a leading Japanese industry newsletter .
Dr. Kobayashi responded that he thought the antibody could potentially kill all infected cells .
But he and Dr. Yonehara said there were still several uncertainties , particularly regarding possible side effects .
`` Our antibody specifically killed infected cells at a very low dose , but it can also kill other cells , '' said Dr. Yonehara .
`` We do n't know the effect of our antibody on the human body .
AIDS is n't considered a widespread problem in Japan -- the government reports about 1,000 known carriers of the virus -- but many companies have poured substantial resources into research in recent years , hoping to cash in on a possible cure .
Dr. Kitamura said about 35 projects are currently under way in Japan , and that Japanese researchers in the past year have made available three possible cures to American researchers for clinical tests .
He said that when scientists from the two countries meet again in January in New Orleans , the Japanese will present at least three more drugs for human testing .
AZT is the world 's only prescription medicine approved for treating the disease .
Wellcome PLC , a major British pharmaceutical maker , sells the drug under the name Retrovir .
A Wellcome spokesman declined to comment on the discovery of the antibody in Japan .
But Andrew Porter , a drug-industry analyst at Nikko Securities Co. in London , said if the product were to be successfully developed it would represent `` a potential threat to the long-term viability of Retrovir .
USG Corp. agreed to sell its headquarters building here to Manufacturers Life Insurance Co. of Toronto , and will lease the 19-story facility until it moves to a new quarters in 1992 .
The building-materials concern did n't disclose terms of the sale , which will close in the first quarter of next year .
Proceeds from the planned sale of the 250,000-square-foot building `` will help reduce the debt incurred as a result of our July 1988 recapitalization , '' said a USG official .
A state judge postponed a decision on a move by holders of Telerate Inc. to block the tender offer of Dow Jones & Co. for the 33 % of Telerate
it does n't already own .
Vice Chancellor Maurice A. Hartnett III of Delaware 's Court of Chancery heard arguments for more than two hours here , but he made no comment and asked no questions .
He could rule as early as today on the motion seeking a temporary injunction against the Dow Jones offer .
Dow Jones has offered to pay $ 18
a share , or about $ 576 million , for the remaining Telerate stake .
The offer will expire at 5 p.m. EST on Nov. 6 , unless extended again .
Robert Kornreich , an attorney for the Telerate holders , told Judge Hartnett
the Dow Jones offer is `` arrogant '' and `` hostile .
'' He accused Dow Jones of `` using unfair means to obtain the stock at an unfair price .
Michael Rauch , an attorney for Dow Jones , defended the offer as adequate , based on what
the company considers realistic projections of Telerate 's revenue growth , in the range of 12 % .
He also contended that the plaintiffs failed to cite any legal authority
that would justify such an injunction .
Telerate provides information about financial markets through an electronic network .
Dow Jones publishes The Wall Street Journal , Barron 's magazine , other periodicals and community newspapers and operates electronic business information services .
Time Warner Inc. reported a third-quarter net loss of $ 176 million , or $ 2.88 cents
a share , reflecting acquisition costs for a 59.3 % stake in Warner Communications Inc. and the purchase method of accounting for the transaction .
Separately , Warner reported a net loss of $ 106 million , or 56 cents
a share , including merger expenses of $ 100 million and $ 120 million in charges associated with stock-appreciation-based compensation plans .
Time Warner is in the process of completing its acquisition of the remaining Warner shares .
Time Warner emphasized in a news release that it should be evaluated based on its cash flow , which
the company defined as earnings before interest , taxes , depreciation and amortization .
On a pro-forma basis , assuming the merger was effective Jan 1 , 1988 , including the results from both Time Inc. and all of Warner , that cash flow figure would be $ 526 million for the latest quarter , more than double the comparable figure
a year ago , or $ 242 million , according to Time Warner .
Some analysts at least are buying that argument , and were n't alarmed by the losses .
`` What really matters is the operating income of the divisions : I look at these numbers and I say , these businesses are doing well , '' said Mark Manson , a vice president of Donaldson , Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp .
`` For example , Warner made more than $ 100 million from filmed entertainment in three months .
That 's a big number .
Warner also had a gain of more than 13 % from records and music publishing , even though the domestic record business was sluggish this summer .
In the year-ago third quarter , Time on its own reported net income of $ 81 million , or $ 1.42
Combined revenue for the latest quarter of Time Warner was $ 2.2 billion , compared with the year-ago Time revenue of $ 1.1 billion .
On a pro forma basis , including all of Warner 's earnings , Time Warner had a third-quarter loss of $ 217 million , compared with a $ 342 million loss
On the same basis , revenue rose to $ 2.7 billion from $ 2.2 billion .
For the third quarter , Warner 's $ 106 million loss compared with a year-ago loss of $ 113 million , or 90 cents
Revenue rose to $ 1.5 billion from $ 1.1 billion .
The 1988 figures were restated to include the results of Lorimar Telepictures Corp. , which
Warner acquired in January .
Time Warner 's operating earnings got a boost from Warner 's record box-office results .
`` Batman '' alone has racked up more than $ 247 million in box-office receipts to date , making it
Warner Bros .
' largest grossing film ever .
`` Lethal Weapon II '' was also a big hit .
Warner also contributed record results from its music business , where unit sales of compact discs rose more than 50 % from a year ago , the company said , helped by Prince 's `` Batman '' soundtrack .
Time Warner said its cable division turned in a 77 % increase in operating cash flow , to $ 166 million from $ 94 million , reflecting higher per-subscriber revenue .
In addition , the 1988 results included a $ 20 million charge reflecting a reserve for relocation related expenses at American Television & Communications Corp .
On the other hand , Time Warner said its operating cash flow declined in the quarter for its magazine division , its books division and the Home Box Office programming division .
In magazines , higher advertising revenues at Sports Illustrated and Fortune were offset by lower ad revenue for other major magazines .
The programming division saw a decline in operating cash flow because the year-ago quarter included a $ 12 million dividend from Turner Broadcasting System and because the quarter includes expenses associated with the Nov. 15 launch of HBO 's Comedy Channel .
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading , Time Warner closed at $ 138.625
a share , up $ 1.875 , while Warner closed at $ 63.875
a share , up 12.5 cents .
MC SHIPPING Inc. , New York , declared an initial quarterly of 60 cents
a share payable Nov. 15 to shares of record Oct. 30 .

a share , in composite trading on the American Stock Exchange .
The company , which went public in May , intends to pay dividends from available cash flow ; the amount may vary from quarter to quarter .
A round of futures-related program selling near the close sent the stock market lower in otherwise directionless trading .
Nervousness that the market has n't seen the last of its recent volatility kept trading at a moderate pace , as did anticipation of a report on the economy 's third-quarter performance .
The Dow Jones Industrial Average , which plunged more than 80 points in early trading Tuesday and then recovered nearly all of its losses by the close , fell 5.94 to 2653.28 in the latest session .
The average drifted in a trading range of about 30 points throughout the day .
The lower boundary was established just after the opening in a brief round of selling ; the upper boundary was set at midday as scattered bargain-hunting pushed prices higher .
Buying interest in Du Pont , which declared a stock split and a dividend boost , and certain other blue-chip issues gave the industrial average
a better performance than broader indexes .
Standard & Poor 's 500-Stock Index dropped 1.20 to 342.50 ; the decline was the equivalent of a nine-point setback in the 30-stock average .
The Dow Jones Equity Market Index fell 1.16 to 320.94 and the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index slid 0.53 to 189.52 .
But advancing issues topped decliners by 784 to 700 on the Big Board despite the late sell programs , resulting from stock-index arbitrage .
The programs occurred against the backdrop of a late pullback in UAL , which had held at slightly lower levels through most of the session amid optimism that another bidder might surface .
Traders said program activity was n't in evidence through most of the session , however , and Big Board volume dropped to 155,650,000 shares from about 238 million Tuesday as concerns about the potential for additional sharp swings in the market kept other trading in check .
`` People are sort of nervous to do anything in the market now .
Our phones are quiet around here , '' said Don R. Hays , director of investment strategy at Wheat First Butcher & Singer Inc. , Richmond , Va .
The gross national product report , due to be released before today 's opening , is expected to show that the economy continued to expand in the third quarter at a moderate pace .

Bond investors sat on the sidelines yesterday , paying little attention to falling stock prices and the government 's latest gross national product report .
`` This was a bit surprising , '' said John Lonski , an economist at Moody 's Investors Service Inc .
He said that in recent weeks , such news has often set a positive tone for the bond market .
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 39.55 points to close at 2613.73 .
Meanwhile , the government reported that third-quarter real gross national product , the inflation-adjusted value of the nation 's goods and services , rose at an annual rate of 2.5 % in the third quarter .
Although the rate of growth was unchanged from the second quarter , economists said the new GNP report had an ominous tone .
Among other things , the report showed a sharp deterioration in export trade , which had been a major source of strength for the economy .
Bond investors did n't show much reaction to the news .
As a result , the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond , which meandered for most of the day , ended little changed .
Mortgage-backed securities moved slightly higher , and investment-grade corporate bonds ended unchanged .
In the junk bond market , most prices were unchanged to slightly lower .
But there was one
notable exception .
The junk bonds of RJR Nabisco , which have been whipsawed in recent months for a variety of reasons , fell sharply yesterday on rumors of possible problems with RJR 's pending $ 1.48 billion sale of its Del Monte canned foods unit to a group led by Merrill Lynch & Co .
However , late yesterday , a spokesman for Merrill Lynch said the planned sale is on track .
Proceeds from the Del Monte sale would account for a portion of the $ 5 billion worth of bank debt RJR had planned to repay by Feb. 9 .
RJR bonds closed one to two points lower , or off between $ 10 to $ 20 for each $ 1,000 face amount .
RJR 's 13 1\/2 % subordinated debentures maturing in 2001 were off 1\/2 at 101 , while its 14.7 % convertible pay-in-kind securities finished the day down 1 7\/8 at 86 .
In the municipal market , institutional selling drove prices sharply lower .
The municipal market has been struggling for weeks to absorb large customer `` bid-wanted '' lists , or sell orders .
But dealers said inventories now are full and bids for bonds are getting soft .
Among others , a bid-wanted list totaling about $ 109 million circulated yesterday .
It followed a $ 223 million sell list handled by Chemical Securities Inc. Wednesday and at least three other lists in that size range within the past two weeks .
Traders said the bonds appear to be coming from a range of investors , with commercial banks among the leading sellers .
Tax law changes
that go into effect later this year make municipal holdings less attractive to certain investors .
Municipal market participants also remain concerned that property and casualty insurers may be forced to lighten their tax-exempt holdings as a result of claims stemming from Hurricane Hugo and the Northern California earthquake .
The Treasury market could get an unexpected $ 17 billion of new supply next week .
Late yesterday , a Treasury official said the department may take the unprecedented step of borrowing $ 17 billion to avoid default on certain obligations unless Congress assures by 1 p.m. EDT today that it will raise the debt limit , according to Dow Jones Capital Markets Report .
If assurance is n't given , the official said the Treasury might raise the money by adding to the weekly Treasury bill issue or through a cash-management bill issue .
The official said Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady indicated the possible move in a letter dated yesterday to House Minority Leader Robert Michel ( R. , Ill .
Separately , the $ 4.52 billion of Resolution Funding Corp. bonds sold Wednesday were quoted late yesterday at 99 19\/32 , down 1\/8 from the auction average .
Much of the Refcorp issue was purchased by four large securities firms
that had planned to repackage the bonds .
But yesterday , some dealers said the repackaged bonds were selling slowly .
The benchmark 30-year bond ended at about 102 21\/32 , compared with 102 22\/32 Wednesday .
The yield was unchanged at 7.88 % .
The 10-year notes ended at about 100 23\/32 , compared with 100 24\/32 .
The yield was unchanged at 7.87 % .
Mortgage securities were 1\/32 to 4\/32 point higher , with Government National Mortgage Association 10 1\/2 % securities
the top-performing issue .
Dealers said the 10 1\/2 % securities rose in response to a $ 500 million purchase by a bank for its mortgage portfolio .
The dealers noted that the securities , which gained 4\/32 to 104 1\/32 , have been relatively weak recently because high-coupon securities are n't favored in rising markets .
Thus , the issue has quite a high yield .
Ginnie Mae 9 % securities were at 98 5\/8 late yesterday , up 2\/32 , and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. 9 % securities were at 97 3\/4 , up 1\/32 .
The yield spread of the Ginnie Mae 9 % issue over the 10-year Treasury note narrowed 0.01 percentage point to 1.45 .
In derivative markets , the Federal National Mortgage Association issued a $ 500 million real estate mortgage investment conduit backed by its 9 % securities through Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc .
In other matters , Maryland National Bank , a unit of Baltimore-based MNC Financial Inc. , became the first commercial bank to issue securities backed by home-equity lines of credit .
The $ 267 million transaction was underwritten by Merrill Lynch Capital Markets .
British government bonds rose for the fourth consecutive day , buoyed by a firm pound and further weakness in British stocks .
But later , after trading had basically ended , the pound declined sharply on the unexpected resignation of Nigel Lawson , Chancellor of the Exchequer .
The Treasury 11 3\/4 % bond due 2003\/2007 rose 10\/32 to 112 30\/32 to yield 9.95 % , while the 12 % notes due 1995 were up 3\/32 at 104 11\/32 to yield 10.86 % .
Japanese government bonds ended lower after quiet trading , pulled down in part by the sale of 500 billion yen ( $ 3.53 billion ) of new one-year bonds .
They were priced at 99.58 to yield 5.163 % with a coupon rate of 5.1 % .
The rate compares with a 4.9 % coupon at the previous auction in August .
In response to the auction , Japan 's No. 111 4.6 % bond due 1998 ended on brokers ' screens at 95.33 , down 0.20 , to yield 5.39 % .
West German bonds ended lower in quiet trading .
Bonn 's 7 % bonds due October 1999 fell 0.10 to 99.95 to yield 7.01 % .
Details of New York City 's forthcoming bond offering were released yesterday .

The city also plans to sell $ 57.8 million of taxable municipal bonds at the same time , possibly maturing in 1994 , 2004 , 2009 and 2010 .
The bulk of the taxable bonds are in the two longest maturities , which are tentatively to total $ 26.9 million each .

that tapped the debt market yesterday was Tenneco Credit Corp .
The subsidiary of Tenneco Inc. offered $ 150 million of seven-year senior notes priced to yield 9.324 % .
The issue was sold through underwriters led by Merrill Lynch Capital Markets .
American Telephone & Telegraph Co. unveiled new optical transmission systems for data , video and voice communications .
Two products in what
the telecommunications giant called a new generation of such equipment are available now , AT&T said , and three others will be introduced in 1990 and 1991 .
The products are aimed at a market expected to total more than $ 1 billion
a year in sales by 1995 , said Morgan Buchner Jr. , vice president of transmission systems for AT&T .
The products already available are cross-connect systems , used instead of mazes of wiring to interconnect other telecommunications equipment .
This cuts down greatly on labor , Mr. Buchner said .
To be introduced later are a multiplexer , which will allow several signals to travel along a single optical line ; a light-wave system , which carries voice channels ; and a network controller , which directs data flow through cross-connect systems .
AT&T said the products , unlike previous generations , will meet so-called Sonet compatability standards , which
AT&T expects to be broadly adopted .
Sonet , or synchronous optical network , products have more capacity than earlier models .
`` These products are the heart of our transmission-product line , '' Mr. Buchner said .
He declined to disclose specific prices , but said each product costs in the tens of thousands , or even hundreds of thousands , of dollars .
AT&T said it expects to beat to the marketplace two rivals , Northern Telecom Ltd. of Canada and France 's Alcatel N.V. , which also have announced Sonet-based products .
AT&T predicted strong growth in demand for such products .
It noted that last July , Nippon Telegraph & Telephone Corp. of Japan selected AT&T to supply $ 154 million of such equipment over a four-year period starting next year .
A decline in Allied-Signal Inc. 's automotive business contributed to flat sales and only slightly higher earnings in the third quarter .
Allied-Signal reported that net rose 1.7 % to $ 121 million , or 81 cents
a share , from $ 119 million , or 80 cents
Sales slipped 1.3 % to $ 2.82 billion from $ 2.86 billion .
For the nine months , the Morris Township , N.J.-based company , with businesses in aerospace , automotive products and engineered materials , earned $ 413 million , or $ 2.77 cents
a share , up 15 % from $ 359 million , or $ 2.40
Sales eased 0.2 % to $ 8.88 billion from $ 8.90 billion .
Chairman Edward L. Hennessy Jr. said that a drop in sales of auto and truck parts contributed to lower earnings in the automotive unit .
He also cited unfavorable foreign-exchange rates and a lower tax rate .
Earnings for the group declined to $ 11 million from $ 33 million last year .
Earnings at Allied-Signal 's aerospace business rose to $ 55 million from $ 41 million
a year ago , primarily on higher sales and profit in its engines and auxiliary power units .
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday , Allied-Signal shares closed at $ 35.125 , off 87.5 cents .
The Treasury plans to raise $ 2.3 billion in new cash with the sale Monday of about $ 16 billion in short-term bills to redeem $ 13.71 billion in maturing bills .
However , the Treasury said it will postpone the auction unless it has assurances of enactment of legislation to raise the statutory debt limit before the scheduled auction date .
The offering will be divided evenly between 13-week and 26-week bills maturing on Feb. 8 , 1990 , and May 10 , 1990 , respectively .
Tenders for the bills , available in minimum $ 10,000 denominations , must be received by 1 p.m. EST Monday at the Treasury or at Federal Reserve banks or branches .
Mobil Corp. is preparing to slash the size of its work force in the U.S. , possibly as soon as next month , say individuals familiar with the company 's strategy .
The size of the cuts is n't known , but they 'll be centered in the exploration and production division , which is responsible for locating oil reserves , drilling wells and pumping crude oil and natural gas .
Employees have n't yet been notified .
Sources said that meetings to discuss the staff reductions have been scheduled for Friday at Mobil offices in New Orleans and Denver .
This would be a second round of cuts by Mobil , which along with other oil producers and refiners reduced its work force by 15 % to 20 % during the mid-1980s as part of an industrywide shakeout .
Mobil 's latest move could signal the beginning of further reductions by other oil companies in their domestic oil-producing operations .
In yesterday 's third-quarter earnings report , the company alluded to a $ 40 million provision for restructuring costs involving U.S. exploration and production operations .
The report says that `` the restructuring will take place over a two-year period and will principally involve the transfer and termination of employees in our U.S. operations .
A company spokesman , reached at his home last night , would only say that there will be a public announcement of the reduction program by the end of the week .
Most oil companies , including Mobil , have been reporting lower third-quarter earnings , largely as a result of lower earnings from chemicals as well as refining and marketing businesses .
Individuals familiar with Mobil 's strategy say that Mobil is reducing its U.S. work force because of declining U.S. output .
Yesterday , Mobil said domestic exploration and production operations had a $ 16 million loss in the third quarter , while comparable foreign operations earned $ 234 million .
Industrywide , oil production in this country fell by 500,000 barrels
a day to 7.7 million barrels in the first eight months of this year .
Daily output is expected to decline by at least
another 500,000 barrels next year .
Some Mobil executives were dismayed that a reference to the cutbacks was included in the earnings report before workers were notified .
One Mobil executive said that the $ 40 million charge related to the action indicates `` a substantial '' number of people will be involved .
Some will likely be offered severance packages while others will be transferred to overseas operations .
First Executive Corp. said about 96 % of the rights to purchase its depositary shares and warrants have been exercised .
Of the 17.6 million rights units issued , just under 17 million were exercised before the Oct. 10 expiration of the offering , the insurance holding company said .
Remaining units will be sold to the underwriters , Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and Kidder , Peabody & Co. , which will also purchase an over-allotment of 2.3 million additional units .
First Executive said the offering will raise about $ 299 million -- minus underwriting fees and other expenses -- that the company plans to use to write new life insurance and annuity business .
In addition , analysts have viewed the rights offering as a takeover defense
that prospectively balloons the number of shares outstanding .
Each of the units consists of two warrants , each of which could be used to purchase a half-share of common stock , and one depositary preference share .
Depositary shares are convertible into common stock on a 1-to-1 basis .
Currently , the company has about 88.1 million common shares outstanding .

TAX SHELTERS CALLED Individual Retirement Accounts , or `` IRAs , '' were created without fanfare on Sept. 2 , 1974 , but grew beyond expectations as an inducement to personal saving .
That Labor Day , in his first major act after succeeding the resigned Richard Nixon as president , Gerald R. Ford signed the Employee Retirement Income Security Act .
Pension reform was its main thrust .
Labor and business leaders , quoted at the White House Rose Garden rites , hailed its provisions for insuring corporate pension benefits .
IRAs were like stepchildren there .
The IRA 's conception is murky .
In 1972 , then Treasury Secretary George Shultz , with the key support of Sen. Carl Curtis , sought some form of pensions for the uncovered .
That year
a four-man group headed by William Lieber in the Legislation and Regulations division of the Office of the Chief Counsel for the Internal Revenue Service , was assigned the task of designing a plan .
They used the 1962 Keogh Plan , a pension plan created by a New York congressman for the self-employed , as a partial model .
This team initially called its new model Personal Retirement Account , or `` PRA .
'' But it did n't sing .
So they opted for IRA , naming it after Ira Cohen , a brilliant IRS actuary
who helped them .
Ira , himself , confirms this account .
IRA rules have been changed over the years .
One in 1981 raised to $ 2,000
a year from $ 1,500
the amount
a person could put , tax-deductible , into the tax-deferred accounts and widened coverage to people under employer retirement plans .
This caused an explosion of IRA promotions by brokers , banks , mutual funds and others .
But in 1986 Congress sharply reduced the number of people
who could qualify for its benefits and IRA tax-deductions slowed their roaring growth .
IRA account assets have grown to about $ 400 billion from $ 393 billion last year and just $ 26 billion in 1981 .
Burmah Oil PLC , a British independent oil and specialty-chemicals marketing concern , said SHV Holdings N.V. has built up a 7.5 % stake in the company .
The holding of 13.6 million shares is up from a 6.7 % stake
that Burmah announced SHV held as of last Monday .
SHV , of the Netherlands , which
last year merged its North Sea oil and gas operations with those of Calor Group PLC and which owns 40 % of Calor , was identified as a possible suitor for Burmah .
Burmah said it had n't held any discussions with SHV and that `` no deal of any nature is in contemplation .
MGM Grand Inc. has agreed to pay $ 93 million and nearly 1.8 million common shares to buy 117 acres of land along the Las Vegas , Nev. , Strip as a site for its planned movie-studio and theme-park resort .
Of the total purchase price , $ 50 million cash and $ 30 million in stock ( nearly 1.8 million shares ) would be paid to buy the existing 700-room Marina Hotel & Casino from Southwest Securities , a Nevada limited partnership .
The remaining properties to be acquired are the Tropicana Country Club & Golf Course , a facility jointly owned by Ramada Inc. , of Phoenix , Ariz. , and the Jaffe family , and a small parcel owned by MGM Grand director James D. Aljian .
The purchase price was disclosed in a preliminary prospectus issued in connection with MGM Grand 's planned offering of six million common shares .
The luxury airline and casino company , 98.6%-owned by investor Kirk Kerkorian and his Tracinda Corp. , earlier this month announced its agreements to acquire the properties , but did n't disclose the purchase price .
The proposed stock offering and issuance of nearly 1.8 million common shares in connection with the land purchase will bring MGM Grand 's total shares outstanding to 28.7 million , of which
72 % will be owned by Mr. Kerkorian and Tracinda , according to the prospectus .
In over-the-counter trading , MGM Grand was bid at $ 17.50
Proceeds from the offering are expected to be used for remodeling the company 's Desert Inn resort in Las Vegas , refurbishing certain aircraft of the MGM Grand Air unit , and to acquire the property for the new resort .
The company said it estimates the Desert Inn remodeling will cost about $ 32 million , and the refurbishment of the three DC-8-62 aircraft , made by McDonnell Douglas Corp. , will cost around $ 24.5 million .
MGM Grand said the latest stock offering wo n't cover the $ 600 million or more cost of building the proposed resort and theme park , and added it will need to seek additional financing , either through bank borrowings or debt and equity offerings , at a later date .
Construction is set to begin in early 1991 .
The resort will include the MGM Grand Hotel , a multi-spired , castle-like facility
that will include 5,000 rooms and 85,000 square feet of casino space .
The facility will be marketed toward families , and room rates will be between $ 35 and $ 55
a night , MGM Grand said .
The prospectus did n't include many details about the studio and theme park , although conceptual drawings , released this month , show that it may feature several `` themed '' areas similar to those found at parks built by Walt Disney Co .
The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission sued New York state for age discrimination against appointed state judges .
The suit , filed in federal court in Manhattan , charges that New York 's mandatory retirement age of 76 violates federal law .
Separately , the commission intervened in a Connecticut state judge 's age-bias suit in federal court in New Haven .
The commission 's filing in that case challenges Connecticut 's mandatory retirement age of 70 for appointed judges .
The New York suit was filed on behalf of Justice Isaac Rubin , whose appointment to the state appellate division expires at year end , and all other judges hurt by the alleged age discrimination .
The suit , assigned to federal Judge Kimba Wood , seeks a permanent injunction , back pay for judges
who have been forced to retire , reinstatement of retired judges and `` other affirmative relief necessary to eradicate the effects of ( New York 's ) unlawful employment practices .
Justice Rubin , a state judge since 1969 , said the mandatory-retirement age hurts the court system because it deprives the state of experienced judges still capable of serving on the bench .
`` The issue is n't age -- age is just a number .
The issue is one of a judge 's experience , his competence and his physical ability to serve on the bench , '' Justice Rubin said .
`` I 've had no problems performing my duties and responsibilities .
'' Because Justice Rubin turned 76 on May 9 , he is n't eligible to be reappointed to the bench at the end of the year .
The suit 's impact on New York may be narrow , however .
Most New York judges are elected , and the federal age-discrimination law does n't apply to elected officials , said James L. Lee , regional attorney for the EEOC in New York .
Under New York law , elected judges must retire at age 70 , but then can be appointed to two-year terms until they reach 76 .
A spokeswoman for the state 's Office of Court Administration declined to comment on the suit .
But she said the state currently has 35 appointed judges
who are over 70 .
In Connecticut , however , most state judges are appointed by the governor and approved by the state legislature .
The parties in the Connecticut case have agreed to stay proceedings pending the appeal of another EEOC age-bias case against Vermont .
In the Vermont case , a federal judge ruled that the state 's mandatory age of 70 for appointed judges was illegal ; Vermont 's appeal of that decision is pending before the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan .
Aaron Ment , Connecticut 's chief court administrator , declined to comment on the suit and the EEOC 's intervention .
He said the state has 165 appointed judges and 15 `` trial referees , '' who are former judges over age 70 and serve a restricted role on the bench .
ORGANIZED CRIME Strike Forces likely to be abolished next month .
U.S. Attorney General Dick Thornburgh 's plan to dissolve the 14 regional organized-crime strike forces is expected to go into effect next month , despite the opposition of Democratic congressional leaders and lawyers in the special units .
The units are autonomous from U.S. attorneys ' offices and focus exclusively on prosecuting organized-crime cases .
In February , Mr. Thornburgh announced his plan to abolish the units .
He says the strike-force lawyers will work more efficiently under the supervision of U.S. attorneys .
Mr. Thornburgh will be free to disband the strike forces after Congress approves a $ 479 million appropriation for federal law-enforcement and drug-interdiction agencies , according to David Runkel , a Justice Department spokesman .
The bill is expected to pass in Congress next month .
Congress temporarily halted Mr. Thornburgh 's effort with an appropriation resolution
that prohibited him from using budgeted funds to implement his plan .
Opponents say Mr. Thornburgh 's plan will needlessly break up longtime , tightly knit crime-fighting units
that have successfully prosecuted major organized-crime figures .
They predict that organized-crime activity will increase once the units are dissolved and their responsibilities transferred to U.S. attorneys ' offices .
Some former strike-force personnel say the units have already begun to break up .
The Eastern District unit in Brooklyn , N.Y. , lost seven of its 15 attorneys
this year partly because the lawyers were troubled by the proposed reorganization , says Laura A. Brevetti , who left the strike force to join Morrison Cohen Singer & Weinstein , a New York law firm .
`` Those
who have left have expressed an opinion that the strike force should continue , '' Ms. Brevetti says .
But Mr. Runkel contends there has been no exodus of strike-force lawyers .
He says 27 lawyers have left and 21 have been hired since Mr. Thornburgh announced his plan .
At the time
the plan was announced , there were 135 lawyers .
Some congressional leaders intend to continue to fight for independent strike forces .
A spokesman for Sen. Edward M. Kennedy ( D. , Mass .
) says Mr. Thornburgh would be required to reinstate the units next year if an proposed omnibus crime bill is passed .
Among other things , the bill calls for a reorganization of the Justice Department .
The Senate is expected to consider the bill shortly , says the senator 's spokesman .
Mr. Runkel says he doubts Mr. Kennedy can muster enough congressional support to reorganize the Justice Department .
`` We will vigorously oppose the bill , '' he says .
`` I do n't think ( the reorganization is ) going to happen .
WHITMAN & RANSOM recruits lawyers from disbanding firm : The 204-lawyer New York firm will bring in at least 12 partners and a not yet determined number of associates from Golenbock & Barell , which will dissolve Dec. 31 .
Golenbock , with 35 lawyers , has lost several partners during the past year .
Some Golenbock lawyers wo n't be invited to join Whitman & Ransom , according to partners at both
firms .
Whitman & Ransom managing partner Maged F. Riad said the Golenbock recruits will enhance the firm 's corporate and litigation departments .
SHORT SKIRTS not welcome in Texas court : Shelly Hancock , a male county court judge in Houston , refused to let a woman plead guilty to a drunk-driving charge because her skirt stopped three inches above her knees .
The woman appeared in court Thursday to enter her
plea , but when she started to approach the bench , she was stopped by Judge Hancock .
He told the woman 's lawyer , Victor Blaine , that the short skirt was inappropriate for a court appearance .
Despite Mr. Blaine 's protests , the judge rescheduled her case for Nov. 27 .
Kelly Siegler , an assistant district attorney
who was in the courtroom , disputed suggestions
the action was sexist , saying she had seen Judge Hancock turn away male defendants dressed in shorts , tank tops or muscle shirts `` many times .
'' Judge Hancock did n't return phone calls .
CAMBREX Corp. , Bayonne , N.J. , declared its initial quarterly of five cents
a share , payable Dec. 1 to stock of record Nov. 10 .
The maker of specialty chemicals has about 5.9 million shares outstanding .
The company said the move recognizes its strong financial position .
Although profits were `` squeezed '' in 1989 , mainly as a result of higher raw-material costs , the company said it is confident about future earnings and cash flow for 1990 and beyond .
In national over-the-counter trading yesterday , Cambrex shares rose 50 cents to close at $ 13

The government said it would streamline its enormous and often-criticized food marketing and distribution network , Compania Nacional de Subsistencias Populares , or Conasupo .
Conasupo Director Ignacio Ovalle Fernandez said the agency will sell 589 midsized supermarkets and several food-production plants and warehouses beginning early next year .
The agency will withdraw from the production of nine food products , maintaining production of the two
most important ones , corn and milk .
Mr. Ovalle also said Conasupo will cut back subsidies to producers of nonessential farm products and close retail outlets in wealthy neighborhoods .
The agency 's workers and private companies would be allowed to bid for the assets up for sale .
Conasupo controls prices on agricultural goods and operates retail outlets where basic consumer items are sold at state-subsidized prices .
Business leaders have long criticized the agency as a leading example of bureacratic waste .
Private-sector leaders praised the Conasupo restructuring .
