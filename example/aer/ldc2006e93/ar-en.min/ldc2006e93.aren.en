greetings to our distinguished viewers .
the ultimate farce , iraqi suicides and not elections ;
an arranged american scheme ;
a historical crime ;
fabricated elections israeli - style to legitimize occupation and project legitimacy onto those who are illegitimate .
that 's how some people comment on the upcoming iraqi elections .
why such an insistence on elections while many people boycott it ?
is it a boycott by the minority ?
or an honorable national political boycott rejecting the birth of a new iraq , whereby the usurper is the midwife , while its agents , the acting government , carry leaflets on its behalf .
another may wonder ,
do those who came to iraq on american invasion tanks and turned the land of the two rivers into rubble , destroying entire cities , exterminating thousands of people , planting mass graves everywhere , and even stealing statues from streets and museums ,
think that the iraqi people will accept them as rulers of the new iraq through elections that are fake from top to toe ? another enquires ,
why are they taking iraqis for fools ?
one of the opponents asks , these masses are very well acquainted with the candidates of these elections ,
and they also know how it will deal with them , even if the invaders vindicate them by ninety percent of votes .
another yells ,
can elections be held in a country where the appointed government controls the green zone only and cannot protect its policemen who are protecting it , and who some of the opponents describe as pagan guards instead of national guards ? our studio guest wonders ,
were the elections ever fair when held under occupation whether in afghanistan or palestine or iraq ?
is not this a great lie just like all american lies which no one believes any longer ? another wonders ,
but on the other hand ,
why this silly discrediting of iraqi elections in the arab media ?
are not all arab elections a series of farces ?
so why the fear of another farce that is far less detrimental ?
for they are not held with one candidate who gets a hundred per cent of the vote , just as the ? important ? leader did before his fall ?
do not elections under occupation seem a thousand times better than under the totalitarian arab regimes ?
is it not enough that there are no intelligence dogs surveying , recording and terrorizing people based on their electoral choice ? an iraqi author queries ,
did israel , for example , put any pressure on the palestinian elections ?
what deplorable arab hypocrisy !
why are they drumming and hooting the horn for palestinian elections , while condemning iraqi elections ?
are not both held under occupation ?
were not many elections in the world held under occupation ,
yet led to good results ?
did not one of the candidates say
that taking part in the elections is an effective step on the path to resisting occupation ?
did not the spokesman for sistani consider anyone not taking part in the elections bound for hell ?
questions i pose live on air to nour almoradi , official high cader spokesman of the communist party
and to mr khalaf abdel samad , secretary - general of the iraqi shaheed society .
we 'll start the debate after the break .
welcome again , dear viewers , we are with you live on air in the opposite direction you can vote on this episode .
are you in favor of holding iraqi elections under occupation ?
you can vote from within qatar by calling nine double zero one triple three ;
from all other parts of the world , call double zero nine seven four nine double zero one nine double zero .
the result so far is seventy eight percent not in favor of holding elections under occupation ,
twenty two percent in favor of holding the elections .
nour almoradi , to begin with ,
i mean , you know that preparation for the iraqi elections is in full swing , but at the same time i mean we see disparate attitudes by prominent arab figures towards these elections .
so while preparations are being made for the elections of a national iraqi council at the end of this month , with american sponsorship ,
they are met with or these elections are met with rejection once , and shifting the security situation in a way that aims at obstructing the elections and creating dangerous circumstances to prevent them being held , on the pretext of the elections being illegitimate since they are run under ah the occupation , you know ,
while %pw they champion at the same time that , these palestinian elections , which were held and which abu mazen won .
these things are going in full swing , regarding peace with the israelis .
so why this commotion over iraqi elections ?
first of all , i salute you , oh heroic freedom fighters , oh shanaar youth ,
blessed are you and the land that gave birth to you .
you buried america 's nose in the sand and taught them a lesson .
sir , i 'm not talking about palestinian elections now .
i 'm talking about the farce of the iraqi elections .
sir ,
the decision , the separation between the valiant iraqi national resistance ,
which shapes events on the iraqi arena , imposes its conditions and moves the symbols of occupation and its collaborators like chess pawns .
to the extent that what is left for occupiers are just hysteric reactions , which , if i am to describe them , are like a moth tied to a string ,
having no mind to use for escape , and every time it jumps it hits the ground , and so on till it dies .
sir , the elections as we know them will not happen because this is the decision of the resistance ; the resistance said it will not happen and is it not going to happen and this is a warning ; that 's first of all .
secondly , the elections should not be held because we are under occupation and the iraqi people is waging a national liberation war .
and consequently this is one of the impediments to elections if previous circumstances ( ( also ) ) permit .
the elections may be held in the house of abdul aziz al-hakeem or the hideout of negroponte or the green zone , this may be possible , and america might bring in let 's say a million soldiers .
but this step will follow its preceding one of patching , the resolutions of the national council , the meetings of donors , the meetings of neighboring countries , sharm al-sheikh , the amman council , the government of sheep , the council of sycophants , this is all in vain .
why ?
because the result at the moment is that we have eighty thousand american casualties , both killed and wounded , two hundred billion american dollars worth of loss in iraq , in addition to the more important element , that being that america 's might is declining in the region and worldwide .
sir ,
as for me i tell the americans , hey americans , whether elections , regardless of whether elections are held in iraq or not ,
therefore i give you one piece of advice , that is
abandon trivialities and move into the real arena of decision - making ,
and it is the battleground and anyway you have no choice .
why ?
because the iraqi national resistance
and its supporters pledged to god that you will leave iraq in coffins ;
you have no choice , the war has started , and may the strongest prevail .
for this reason ,
i personally , while i don 't speak for iraqi resistance , am sure they say the same thing
i personally say i care not for these elections nor their karkouzian karzaian abu - mazinian outcomes , in my view , they are as good as non - existent .
mr khalaf .
in the name of allah , most compassionate and clement , in fact , i hope we can keep our agreement that the episode maintains an appropriate standard .
ah .
ah .
listeners and viewers may benefit if we refrain from using impolite words , such as cows or sheep .
ah , um . . .
please dr faisal , let 's agree on this from the start . . . please let me finish .
pardon me , cows and that 's in short . . .
should i continue ? indeed
go ahead , so don 't object .
we aspire to have the elections held under ideal circumstances like the rest of the world ,
such as france , holland and germany , but it is our destiny that elections in arab countries must always be held under the whiplash of occupation .
i think the majority of iraqi people are in favor of elections , because ,
first of all , the elections , the elections will produce an elected government .
and according to the security council resolution fifteen forty six , the elected government has the right to demand of the occupation forces to leave iraq , and that 's the real goal and the ultimate end which is needed , which is endorsed by every honorable iraqi .
secondly , the elections will produce for us . . .
and the dishonorable don 't believe in it ?
he who wants patriotism doesn 't believe in ( ( it ) )
so this means , i mean , you mean , ah , go head , no we are talking about these words , watch your tongue .
let me finish , man
i mean what did he tell you ? the sheep are worthless , then ? the sheep are worthless ? i mean if you said this in europe they might file a legal suit against you , ah , go ahead , go ahead .
no , use honorable words , not cows or sheep . a human , a human is a human , a human is %pw a human , humans cannot be equated with animals .
okay , well this is not our topic .
my specialization , my specialization . . .
the elections will produce a government that will work to , will respect the iraqi people , and work to fulfill its expectations ,
not like the government we have nowadays .
nice .
the tasks of which are rehabilitation of baathists instead of rehabilitation of martyrs and prisoners . i 'll give you two examples of this .
ah .
the baath uprooting committee had been created and we expected it to uproot baath , yet it . . .
the baath uprooting committee brought back to government departments fourteen thousand baathists from the rank of a team member and higher .
ah , um
and we hoped it would really be created but now we hope a committee will be created to uproot martyrs ,
in the hope that the government will take care of martyrs ' children , provide care to martyrs ' parents , and decree social welfare for martyrs ' widows .
lovely .
but i hope there will be a committee to uproot the prisoners who spent many years of their lives in saddam 's jails for the freedom of this country
wonderful , ah . . .
as for hearing the interior minister of iraq
call on the men of the former regime to join the police corps ,
this reminds me of the mass graves , it reminds me of the baath cells where i lived , the size of which is two by three meters with a one meter toilet , and thirty seven inmates .
give me a minute please , this is not our subject .
go on , go on , ah
this is not our subject , let 's focus on the elections , ah
i say , i say yes , i say that
yes , yes , nice .
that we need an elected government which takes care of the people and respects their wishes ,
but a government caring more about jordan than the iraqi people is something the iraqi people do not want .
why is there more interest in aqaba port than basra port ?
wonderful , quite good .
why don 't we even use the nearby ports ? we use the aqaba port . the elections will establish a government , a constitutional country .
ah , ah . . .
not a country left to its own devices , and the elections will also establish a governance in the hands of people , a fair governance shared among all sects of the iraqi people , instead of having it centered in the hands of one sect , of one tribe , one party or one religion .
ah , ah , lovely .
the elections establish a government that distributes the country 's wealth fairly , distributes the resources among all classes of society instead of keeping them in the hands of a small group , as was the case in saddam 's time where the the closest and least significant city benefited more from iraqi oil than basra , which currently exports eighty five percent of iraqi oil .
lovely .
we say the opponents of elections fall into six categories ,
they either carry the culture of dictatorship , which believes that all who don 't %pw act according to what i believe must be a collaborator or an american and must be killed .
okay .
or those whose hearts are filled with dark racial hatred
and that 's because they are afraid of the entitlements of democracy , because they know the majority of iraqi people are followers of the prophet 's descendants , peace be upon them .
and also those who pulled out , who lost hope in their chances of victory in the elections and so pulled out before the scandal , because they used to claim they represented five percent of the iraqi people ,
and also those who do not want elections , those who lost their interests in iraq and are afraid of the establishment of a government whose slogan is : iraq first not the outside world .
fifth ,
fourth , rather fifth , those who don 't want elections had ambitions of personal glory so when the situation changed and they did not have any personal glory they shifted to the other camp .
and finally deluded pople who were fooled by arab media , national media , which carried slogans that turn iraq from the region 's richest country to its poorest country .
lovely , in short very good .
and that 's why i say the elections , the elections are a popular demand and ( ( %pw ) ) let me say :
ah ,
most of the national parties are in favor of the elections because elections are the lifeblood of peoples , through which they breathe democracy .
very nice , have you heard this speech ?
i heard , i heard it well .
go ahead .
nevertheless , i hope my colleague will be concise because we are trying to be brief , because all these words ( ( bring it on ) ) are all ( ( irrelevant ) ) .
anyway , man ,
you can know the elections by their candidates .
nice and simple .
this is a good maxim .
who are the proponents of holding the elections ?
iraqis are resisting .
iraqis don 't want these elections , despite what i say ; here you go , sir , this is a list of the names of national parties and the institutions that are against the elections .
and to show their clout , i 'll read to you :
the committee of muslim scholars , imam al-khalisi university , office of ayatollah ahmed al-hassani al-baghdadi , office of ayatollah qasim al-tai , arab nationalist trend movement , united national front , iraqi turkman front , the iraqi christian democratic party , and the list continues to include trade unions and the youth union and so on . i don 't want to prolong my speech and use up the time of what 's - its - name .
good , okay .
um .
now be sure that america and the agents of allawi and britain all want the elections overtly , but they are against them covertly .
em , em
and also these documents , be they from %pw the pen of patrick seil , ? al-fateshteshy ? , european sources , and washington decides .
therefore , postponing the elections , allawi , al-jaafri and al-hakim discussed with al-sistani the possibility of postponing the elections with documentation , okay man .
those who demand the elections are sistani , the mafia of kurds and israel .
the mafia of kurds .
the mafia of kurds , okay .
i take responsibility and i hope my collegue can overlook this issue because i take responsibility .
israel demands these elections because there is a former law , by means of which the descendants of exiled iraqis are eligible to vote . the descendents of iraqis who , strangely , number two hundred thousand , i don 't know where they got such figures . i mean they outnumber the labour and likud parties combined .
furthermore , these elections , all the two hundred and twenty six lists running for elections are all in favor of establishing relations with israel without exceptions ; this is regarding israel .
as for the mafia of tarazani , i collapse talibani and barazani , collapse the two into tarazani alone .
the noble kurdish people are fully innocent of this mafia .
anyway , this mafia wants ,
it is either paid by israel ,
or it aspires to birds ' dreams , independence and what have you , as if the iraqi people will simply give them independence . you are still , watch out .
sistani and you have hakim , al-jaafri , al-fayadh , al-najafi , bahr al-uloum , shahristani and finally their follower al-jalabi .
okay , man , except for al-jalabi , those are all iranians , okay , as for al-fayadh and al-najafi , one of them is an afghan and the other is a pakistani .
okay , all the others are iranian citizens .
they are under iranian civil laws and under the iranian tax system .
till this moment , they travel using iranian documents , including al-sistani who has been in iraq for fifty years . okay , this is one point .
if there were enemies of shiites and islam , then they would be those whose names i mentioned specifically .
note , those are graduates of the religious school , the religious school of qum .
in nineteen seventy six , the religious school of qum celebrated and distributed confectionery , sweetmeats and slaughtered meat , and they exchanged congratulations on the occasion of the arabs ' defeat before israel in the defeat of huzairan , and this is a document penned by the imam jawad al-khalisi .
okay .
those do not represent shiites , and shiites are innocent of them ; shiites are nobler than being represented by those .
note , sir , that the shiite trend represents the sadr trend which managed to move fifteen provinces .
it also represents the currents of al-khalisi , al-husni , al-qasim , al-tai and the other imams whose names i cannot recall .
it is also represented by the tribal trend as well , and there are also the secularists who are about a third shiite . as for the al-sistani trend , trust that despite all the cheers and sketches and what have you ,
i bet he doesn 't have ten percent of the shiite trend , because i don 't consider it shiite ; on the contrary i consider this a talmudic trend .
go ahead , man .
let 's look at the symbols of this political trend one after the other ; we start with ahmed al-jalabi ,
a bank embezzler , a currency counterfeiter connected to the likud , the marxian likudist ,
israel 's most loyal of friends , and he 's the one who sent al-alusi there and he says there is a pragmatic relationship between the shiites and america and if the shiites win the elections they will not ask america to leave iraq ; this is a point .
of course , al-jalabi is the mastermind behind the al-haidari courtyard tragedies ; imagine this insane guy who is under the protection of al-sistani being the mastermind behind the al-haidari courtyard tragedy , and ashoura in al-kadhemiya , and najaf in al-kadhemiya , and al-kirbala , and kirbala .
furthermore ,
then it 's he who shelters the mossad elements who assassinate iraqi scientists and ah experts of course i didn 't make this up ;
an iraqi report reveals al-jalabi 's collusion with israel and mossad elements , who are such , and you can refer to this report .
moreover , al-jalabi is paid one million seven hundred thousand dollars monthly by sharon in return for services he performs on his behalf in iraq .
imagine this , al-sistani sponsors al-jalabi , al-jalabi strikes holy shiite shrines , what a catastrophe ! to top it off ,
if we talk about abdel - aziz al-hakim and his cursed brother baqer ,
they are the ones who signed the document with washington for the occupation of iraq , while it was signed with london by the damned abdel - majid al-jour .
imagine ,
when abdel - aziz al-hakim had been in office for one month as head of the sheep council or the government council , out of consideration to the , to the gentleman ,
he endorses a hundred billion dollars as compensation from the iraqi people to iran .
of course , this , these compensations were not endorsed by international courts .
the united nations did not endorse it even when the two countries stopped fighting ; they did not endorse this the decision ( ( came ) ) i imagine for no reason but gratitude .
of course , i don 't want to to delve into discussing these people , because i will well and truly pause at al-sistani .
al-sistani , and i hope the gentleman will present the picture . . .
please let me finish .
okay , okay , i will give you a chance but the director is telling us that the the the you know %pw %pw we 'll get back i 'll give you a chance , but after the news brief .
but before that you can vote , let me mention the voting . do you want iraqi elections to be held under occupation ? you can vote from qatar by calling nine double zero one triple zero and from other parts of the world by calling double zero nine seven four nine double zero one nine double zero
the result is now seventy per cent against holding the elections under occupation , with thirty per cent in favor of it . we 'll get back to you after the news update from the newsroom . till then , goodbye .
my honored viewers , welcome . i apologize for this interruption in the , in the broadcast .
i only want to report to our viewers , we are in downtown beirut , and the , the , the site in which president rafik hariri was assassinated is not very far from us ,
and uh , uh , that is , even the impact of the destruction that reached at at the time , we are here in , in the offices of al-jazeera , the glass is broken .
and uh , i tell you when the explosion occurred i was next to , uh , walid jumblatt 's administration .
and the fact is that i imagined directly based on the power of the explosion , and you know where walid jumblatt is in ( ( clemenceau ) ) , far from that place , i imagined that the explosion targeted walid jumblatt . and there we noticed another issue ,
uh uh , with with the , with the interruption you were talking about , a last sentence , whoever does not read this political scene is mistaken , i mean , uh , we reported on that last point .
i say , mr , ghassan , whoever did not %pw , whoever did not read the reverberations of the assassination event , the event of the deplorable crime on the islamic street , is mistaken .
president hariri has been a benefactor on the , the general political scene in lebanon , and specifically on the islamic one
he enjoys very good relations . with all the parties of the islamic scene , with the islamic authorities , with the uh institutions , with the associations ,
yes
for this reason i consider that this segment has now been afflicted with a kind of orphanhood .
uh , i report , uh , it was rumored this morning that , uh , there was , uh , a former minister , the former minister of education samir al-jisr , and the former minister of the economy , uh , bassem fleihane , were in the company of president rafik hariri ,
a denial was issued by the office of , uh , former minister samir al-jisr that he was not at all injured ,
but what is certain is that mr. bassem fleihane %pw suffered burns , severe burns and his condition is %pw extremely critical .
i also point out to our viewers so that we understand the full picture , the convoy of former prime minister rafik hariri is unparalleled %pw in the , in the region , the middle east , in the arab region , and in the gulf ,
those who know say that his convoy from a security standpoint is unparalleled except , uh uh , the american president .
president rafik hariri 's convoy generally consists of a large number of cars , all of these cars are generally , uh , armored ,
and always in front of president rafik hariri 's convoy is a car for jamming , uh uh , electronic jamming and uh also behind rafik %pw this convoy also , another car for jamming .
and consequently the ability to bring harm from a distance , uh , with bullets , or with , even with launchers , to this convoy generally they cannot do this .
and it is said that this , these security capabilities can monitor any , uh , trouble from this direction , from this direction at a distance of five hundred meters ,
and so for this reason , some think it more likely that the operation in fact was done , uh , with , with a suicide operation in a car of this kind .
i am staying with you at this point , mr. assa ' ad harmoush ,
the victory and jihad group has contacted the al-jazeera channel and claimed responsibility for this matter ,
we , in order for us to be , uh , be clear , they contacted us earlier but we publicized only the name but we waited until until we broadcast this tape ,
uh , it called itself the victory and jihad in the countries , uh , in greater syria group ,
and you very well know what it said with respect to this man so as to implement it ,
ok , what does it say ?
this group appears to be uh ( ( ) ) fundamentalist .
i in the , in the beginning , i say that president hariri , may god have mercy on him , enjoys a special relation with all the parties of the islamic scene in lebanon
and i do not know to what extent this information is correct , and to what extent this tape is authentic .
this case
i mean , what do you know ? what is it , uh , that you do not know the extent of its correctness , i mean ?
the extent of correctness % pw
he is the man in image and voice and his name is abu adass or something like that ,
true , %pw true , true , true
i do not know if his fighting name is ahmad abu adass , as he evidently described
who is this ahmad abu adass ? and who is this party ? and who is this group ?
the party
this is a case that i consider to be , uh , to be a candidate for an investigation and in - the hands of the lebanese judiciary which assigned the judicial council to investigate this case &gt;
uh , but i , as someone who follows the islamic scene , i consider this group to be a group that is not present in lebanon ,
and that this character , or this person is unknown , ahmad abu adass and who he is and ( ( ) ) ,
in addition to a first reading of - the statement that was issued , the truth is that i think that it was drafted in an extremely poor quality that shows perhaps , uh , in this vein , in this vein , that there is great disparity between , uh , known islamic literary eloquence and this %pw manner
i was just told that the , uh , security authorities here in lebanon have announced that they have discovered someone who is connected to this act
and the mufti of the republic , uh , sheikh rashid kabbani has called the former prime ministers to a meeting at his place within the half hour ,
and with this , uh , mr , nasser kandeel , the former minister uh , member of parliament marwan hamadeh , who was the subject of an assassination attempt a while back , has accusedsyria of being behind what happened .
and the statement of the beirut bloc , you are %pw , %pw , a member of the beirut bloc , but it looks like you were not at at this meeting , they accused , i mean , the , uh , security authorities , the security agencies ,
what do you say about this issue ?
well , obviously there is no doubt that we must distinguish between two issues , between the political tension that exists between the regime and the opposition and that is a real situation , a situation which is not the responsibility of the opposition , only
of course . there is a level of political tension and chaos in which the country has been put during the last period , and which has made all of us ready to step right into strife , such that when a heinous crime of that magnitude is committed among us ,
yes
rapid instinctive emotions will lead us to exchanging and throwing accusations .
and i say we have done so , when the assassination attempt took place against former minister marwan hamadeh we were dragged into throwing accusations at each other on this issue ,
yes
it is natural that our irresponsible absurd theater is ready for such language ,
but i say that what appeared on the al-jazeera screen is certainly , we have no evidences on it , but it is something different than what we are accustomed to in terms of bogus statements operations , that is , those that come by fax or by voice over the telephone ,
we are now facing something that resembles the style adopted by certain organizations that call themselves jihadist organizations .
yes , yes
from the radical organizations whose deeds we witness in iraq , ( cough )
suicide car bombs that target ( ( ) ) , that target public places , that operate in a programmed systematic way to bring iraq into the fires of sectarian strife , such that we no longer know who is driving whom .
those or kissinger who talks about the fact that partition is the only remaining solution not only for iraq , but for the balkanization of the region where it has become impossible to tolerate the existence of unified central regimes ?
i fear and i say let us look closely , and i agree the , the , the , the brother , uh , assa ' ad that we have to look closely and wait for the investigation , but we have before us an event that is not ordinary .
we have before us something that beckons us to be cautious , we indeed face the possibility that lebanon has been placed on the agenda of these groups .
here i want to point out two issues .
we know that there are cells of these groups , and it is no secret to anyone that many of those who go to iraq go by way of lebanon , and are among the lebanese and palestinians residing in lebanon ,
and that some things associated with the events of majdal anjar were related to an issue of that nature .
but the truth for which we were not ready is that the decision to strike in lebanon has been taken , and is on its way to being implemented .
yes
first , if what former minister marwan hamadeh said before this statement was issued , it is one of the ramifications of the chaos and atmospheres that , the fanaticism that accompanies a huge incident of this magnitude in a climate of rising political fever .
but if president hariri were alive , he would surely not have joined , if someone other than him was the target , that level of leveling accusations .
after this incident , i say that all those who pointed the finger of accusation towards syria , even in secret , all those whose statements included , by suggestion or insinuation , such as the french statement that spoke of an international investigation to the effect that lebanon and syria are involved as official institutions as responsible for the incident ,
i say those , even those who believed secretly that syria is an accomplice , need to apologize publicly after what was issued , because what was issued is greater than dealing with it with the recklessness we are hearing .
just one last word i want to say here , the biggest loser with the departure of president rafik hariri is not the sunni community , and not the beirut decision bloc , and not beirut , it is the taef agreement .
civil peace in lebanon is entering a new phase ,
the departure of one of the greatest authors and guardians of the taef agreement ,
a week ago , i met president hariri after bristol iii ,
yes
and there had been a telephone call between us , even though i was in a relationship mode , based on his wish , that included putting some distance from the climate of the , the bloc ,
and it was a discussion of more than two hours , he was clarifying his fear for the taef agreement .
he was saying , i feel that the taef agreement is in jeopardy
and i feel that this polarization that is now proceeding absurdly is irresponsible on both sides of the conflict ,
yes
the loyalists and the opposition and i am not trying to stay in the middle of the road .
( cough )
i am afraid that the taef agreement will be the next martyr in lebanon ,
yes , yes
i say maybe , and this is what i am afraid of , that the martyrdom of rafik hariri is the beginning of the martyrdom of the taef agreement .
uh , however , uh , it has been reported uh %pw to us also that the un secretary general , mr. kofi annan has contacted , uh , mr. walid jumblatt and has asked him to exercise the highest degree of caution and vigilance ,
uh uh the opposition that is affiliated with mr. walid jumblatt attended a meeting in qoraytem
and uh , %pw , uh i mean his colleagues confirmed that he was armed while there and maybe this is a political message ,
uh , the meeting has ended according to what abbas nasser is telling me now , the meeting in qoraytem has ended ,
and at any moment now , perhaps mr. uh bassem al-sabea will read a statement , which we may see live and listen to what he said
but according to what mr. hani hammouda , chairman of the al-mustaqbal newspaper , also told us , in the statement there will be very strong language and it will perhaps for the first time talk about something he calls the end , he demands the end of what he calls the syrian occupation ,
however , still we must confirm this matter .
mr. karim bakradoni , is the lebanese regime in trouble ? and is syria in trouble after the departure of rafik hariri %pw in this in this fashion ?
there is no doubt that the assassination of the late rafik hariri puts the lebanese government and the syrian government in a predicament
and i think that those who did , who carried it out , and i until further notice say that there are some who , uh , claimed that they , claimed ( ( ) ) that they are behind this assassination ,
obviously this requires an investigation and scrutiny .
yes
but i say that the assassination of rafik hariri is aimed precisely specifically at embarrassing syria , and embarrassing lebanon , and embarrassing the two governments and placing them in the prisoner 's dock , and harm them , and calling for what i said about the internationalization and calling on the forces to , uh uh uh , exert pressure internationally on the lebanese government and the syrian government , yes ,
ok , i am sorry , mr. karim bakradoni , so that we discuss the politics here and a logical analysis , you are not a security man , and i am not a security man ,
of course
there are parties who are accusing syria in this matter and the local security services , you perhaps are not convinced of this matter
ok , and it is necessary
yes
why why , uh uh , we can exclude that syria is behind the assassination of rafik hariri
especially since , uh uh , some of syria 's allies in lebanon here were publicly accusing that rafik hariri , that he was the leader of the opposition ,
there are even some who said he was the puppeteer who controlled all the opposition ?
analyze this for me logically now because we have no information .
ok
why wouldn 't syria have an interest in assassinating rafik hariri , as well as the lebanese regime , so that we agree with you ultimately , does it have an interest or not ?
ok , i we give , uh , three , three successive arguments about why i exclude syria .
first i exclude syria because the act of assassinating rafik hariri is an act , uh , the first thing that comes to mind is that syria is behind it , that is , this is what is called the open act .
and therefore , i think that rafik hariri , you know , in his present situation was
ok , mr , karim bakradoni , if you only please , we go to qoraytem where the meeting of the opposition has ended , uh , perhaps , uh , there in qoraytem ( ( ) )
deliverance .
for which the great martyr has long fought ,
and it calls on all the lebanese who are loyal to the sovereignty , independence , freedom of the country - democracy , to stand as one in defense of these objectives and to express their anger and their categorical rejection of all attempts , attempts at consolidating the status quo and perpetuating the catastrophic situation in which the country is living .
in the face of these dangerous developments , the opposition declares the following : a , hold the lebanese regime and the syrian regime as the custodial powers in lebanon , responsible for this crime and other similar crimes .
b , demand from the international community to assume its responsibilities towards lebanon the captive nation and call for the formation of an international inquiry commission to seize this crime given the lack of trust by the lebanese in this regime and all its organizations .
c , demand the departure of the regime that has lost its constitutional , popular and international legitimacy , and the formation of a transitional government , and the complete withdrawal of the syrian forces before the upcoming elections .
d , call the lebanese people to a general strike for the duration of three days beginning tomorrow to denounce the crime .
and the opposition has declared that this meeting is to be considered a national conference and will keep their meeting , meetings open to take measures that will ensure that these demands are met ,
thank you .
this is then what uh mr. uh bassem al-sabea said ,
mr. karim bakradoni , clearly it holds the regime in lebanon responsible for what happened ,
it demands that the international community also assume its responsibility towards lebanon , the captive nation as he described ,
it demands an international inquiry commission to seize the %pw , the dossier that demands the departure of the regime that has lost its legitimacy and the complete withdrawal of syrian forces , he did not mention the syrian occupation ,
and called for a general strike for a duration of three days , your first comment ?
and consider themselves a national conference , ok .
yes , this uh yes , an open national conference gathering , yes .
the first comment , we are in a moment , true an emotionally charged moment , and i completely understand the emotion in this statement .
but what is requested is a moment of %pw , a moment of responsibility now and not a moment of emotionalism .
and i think that lebanon is at a defining moment , and at a dangerous place , i very much fear that emotionalism has overtaken responsibility , we go where
( cough )
is this how you see it , emotional ?
yeah ,
where is the emotionalism in it ?
i ( ( will tell you ) ) to hold , to blame the lebanese and syrian regimes before any investigation , and three hours after the assassination of rafik hariri , to hold them it is overreaching that they are responsible , and the statements that said that syria is behind the operation , this is emotional , this is undoubtedly emotional ,
i mean , no one can within three hours , now look here , there is in people 's brains , each one has , uh , an analysis .
but i , three hours after this assassination , accuse two parties , this is kind of , this is very emotional even , and dangerous , and dangerous .
yes
this , yeah the lebanese regime , uh , is responsible in principle .
but i wanna remind that america is a government that is in principle responsible for the security of the americans and we know what happened on the 11th , we know in iraq the americans are present , and what 's goin ' on there ? we know in israel what 's goin ' on .
yes
therefore , to accuse the lebanese and syrian regimes of the assassination of rafik hariri , this is an emotional reaction from which we must step back and be responsible .
what is your opinion on this point ?
i will get back to you , please .
in fact , i consider that the lebanese scene has been infiltrated and there are several services acting to sow discord and perhaps exploit the existing state of political tension and fury .
maybe there is a party that has tried to exploit the sharp political division the country is witnessing in front of resolution uh 1559 , and its repercussions , and the position vis - a - vis the opposition , and the other position , i consider that there may be those who exploited this situation and used it in the assassination operation , this is one possibility .
we cannot say immediately that there is a party ,
we , as we said , that this , that this %pw may be a fabrication , uh the statement that was issued , as well as the accusation uh uh against syria uh ( ( ) )
fabrication or not , in any case for the information you said that there was one person who may have been %pw arrested
but what we have just received , that the security authorities have raided the house of ahmad abu daath whose picture appeared on the screen and as a result the man is lebanese , thus , yes , he was present , and the security authorities have raided his house .
because present ? present , present ( ( ) )
mr. nasser kandeel
we consider the case to be a security case , judicial in the first degree that violates the existence , the role , and the stability of lebanon . for this reason , more careful reflection is required in it , more prudence and caution and consequently %pw a calm discussion of the subject away from hasty reactions .
the information as you see now , is that the man is a palestinian presence right here in in lebanon .
uh mr. nasser kandeel uh let us complete the commentary on this matter
and we wish that there would be , i would have wished that a person present there at the meeting would be with us , so that we could discuss this issue now that they have ended their meeting ,
true , true
colleagues are in the process of contacting one of the friends in in the opposition so he can join us , because we want his discussion to be enriching in in , uh , in a manner that is %pw objective and balanced .
nevertheless when the opposition now demands , demands that the international community assume its responsibilities towards lebanon the captive nation and %pw the formation of an international inquiry commission , given that jacques chirac , president jacques chirac , has also demanded the formation of an international inquiry commission
and mr. faress elsaid , your colleague the member of parliament also said that we demand international protection ,
i heard him today saying we are demanding international protection not for the sake of an international investigation , please go ahead , sir .
well , if we take things through a process of analysis and not between us as you indicated , a security man can analyze from a police perspective , we analyze the politics .
the most prominent challenge confronting syria now , in front of anyone who wants to read with calm , with reason and with neutrality , the most prominent challenge is the attempt at transforming lebanon into a situation under international custody .
i do not think anyone can find another term to describe the nature of the challenge that syria is confronted with at the present time , beginning with the issuing of resolution 1559 that constitutes a milestone in this context
and the continuing repercussions , it is the only resolution among the resolutions of the region for which a special international envoy has been designated , to begin his visits , preparing for a report to the secretary general .
therefore the context is one whereby there are some people on the international scene who want , on the lebanese scene , seeking to gain power from internal lebanese climates , to create an equilibrium that removes lebanon from a certain formula known for its special relation - so we do not use overused expressions - distinct and excellent , for a special relation between it and syria , and into the arms of another international regional equation apparently named the security council , and whose content is the french - american duality .
i am posing the question , and in all calmness and in all objectivity , the assassination of the martyr president rafik hariri : does it bring us closer to that danger or does it take us away from it ?
if it takes us away from the danger of internationalization , i say the accusers have the right to direct accusations at syria or others to say that taking this bitter cup away can be accomplished through this operation .
but if it takes us fast towards internationalization , and i say this is what is happening now from chirac 's words , to the opposition 's words , to kofi annan 's call , to whatever we will hear next , it has been only hours , and i say wait
yes
much much much of what has been prepared inside the drawers will now come out to the surface of the table and we will hear an international uproar ,
perhaps the security council will call us to convene in order to say that this lebanon , the word for a captive state ,
we heard that there is a project that has been in preparation for a month to consider lebanon a captive state in a resolution to issue from the security council
and that there is an american demand and that there is a draft bill ,
captive nation , ( ( name it ) ) captive nation , nation
precisely
( ( ) )
and so this is therefore part of the context .
i say that syria and lebanon , which are attached to having the special lebanese - syrian relation be under discussion on an open table between the lebanese and the syrians without the interferences of international custody , will pay the price in the aftermath of this crime that targeted the lebanese - syrian relation before anything else
let me tell you something mr. nasser kandeel , we analyze , don 't we ?
yes
uh , %pw , uh let us suppose that another person %pw not from your political persuasion is present here , and he tells you the following : you want to exclude those agencies and those local and regional authorities from the assassination of rafik hariri .
but they also have an interest , it is a message that is addressed to everyone
when a huge figure called rafik hariri is assassinated , everyone now will yield , i mean all %pw now will go %pw off the tracks , as they say .
i think
everyone will be afraid , everyone will be terrified , everyone will live in a state of dread .
is this the truth ?
this is not the truth .
i say these words are trying to create climates of unrealistic assumptions .
on the day of the attempted assassination of marwan hamadeh it was said that the objective from it was to terrorize the opposition members who voted against the extension .
or you consider that he who wants to do this terrorizing is stupid given that the outcome was that the opposition has raised the tenor of its discourse , and the nature of the challenge in the susbtance of its discourse
and %pw and he who tried through the assassination attempt against marwan hamadeh did not learn that this kind of actions push the opposition in the present international climate into further escalation , chaos and seeking protection in international assimilation ?
did you not hear general michel aoun saying that we have reached the safety phase and that the entire world is now ready to intervene ?
the words of french president jacques chirac ?
i say that if we want to take things into the contexts they engender and not in the assumptions that some want to invent , the context that was created by the assassination of president rafik hariri is the context that has thrust lebanon quickly towards internationalization , the internationalization that constitutes an open war on syria at this stage .
that is , that syria has been targeted with the blood of president hariri twice .
yes
once , because he was an ally and i insist on this ,
i say that this statement , if there was any of the others of the opposition in uh , may god protect them all , and if president hariri was the one concerned with the issuing of the statement , he certainly would not have approved such a text ,
because i , from the standpoint of intimate knowledge , i know that president hariri would at certain moments reach the point of saying : if i were to choose between bringing harm to the standing that syria represents as a symbol of national dignity in this phase and retiring from political work , i will not hesitate to stay home . these are words he told me in person and he said them a week ago .
yes
and i am not talking about words from ten years ago ,
in the heat of the confrontation , and in a moment %pw of a difficult relation between him and syria , he used to tell me these words from a conscientious position , believing in his belonging to the arab nationalist movement .
i say do not kill rafik hariri twice , by using him against the cause that he used to fight for ,
the cause of rafik hariri was to say that the taef agreement remains suitable to be the book of arbitration between the lebanese themselves on one hand , and between them and syria on the other hand .
yes
neither does internationalization constitute our umbrella for the relationship with syria , nor does internationalization constitute the basis for re - producing our shared life as lebanese .
to go from the blood of rafik hariri to internationalization , we are killing him again .
yes
uh , mr. karim bakradoni , you were among the supporters of the extension by force , and you spoke about this issue without embarrassment ,
but after the extension you are outside the regime ,
and you can now , and we can analyze ,
yes , without embarrassment ( ( again ) )
do you uh uh view positively %pw the policy adopted by the new lebanese regime after the extension ?
there is now unprecedented political tension in lebanon ,
isn 't it ?
unprecedented in this manner at least .
there is an escalation by the , on the part of both parties .
but let me talk now about the regime , did it make a mistake or was it right in this ? in its political approach , in its media discourse , in accusing the leaders in this manner ?
and maybe what contributed to it , as you said , is also that the lebanese regime is in trouble .
i mean , the performance of the regime or the performance after the extension was the result of the - tension during the extension .
and there is no doubt that the harm is unhealthy and not new .
but there is a big difference between the performance and the choice ,
the choice of wisdom and the lebanese government and regime is an absolutely right choice , even if the performance has many deficiencies , this is the first thing .
the second thing , the climate in which the %pw opposition escalated , i mean , when the opposition escalates , whether the %pw , uh , or the various oppositions , particularly the bristol opposition , it created an atmosphere of high tension , the departure of the government , its toppling , the toppling of the president of the republic , rejecting this and that , i mean it raised ( ( the performance ) ) , it created a climate which , if there is really responsibility in it about improper performance . there is responsibility on part of the opposition for this unwarranted escalation , these are the two points .
yes
and from this unwarranted escalation , let me tell you , my fear now is that the opposition is accusing the lebanese and syrian authorities , maybe it 's accusing an innocent party and leaving the criminal outside of the accusation .
the most dangerous thing that can happen is to blame an innocent party for the blood of rafik hariri , and to absolve the criminal .
this is an improper emotional reaction and these are hasty accusations . after ,
yes , ok , when the opposition demands now now now demands the departure of the regime ( ( that has lost its ) ) legitimacy and the complete withdrawal of the syrian forces . is it possible for this thing to happen now ?
uh , with its departure ( ( ) )
never , this is , this is an escalation that will lead to division and
and of course it is an implicit call for the withdrawal of syrian forces from lebanon .
this reference was dropped in the statement which the security council adopted ah in the end .
and of course the statement denounced the assassination of rafiq hariri .
it also stated that the assassination ah of rafiq hariri should not threaten the running of the anticipated parliamentary elections under circumstances he described as free , transparent and democratic .
in addition , the statement called on secretary - general of the united nations , kofi anan , to submit an urgent report according to the wording of the statement adopted by the council ah regarding the circumstances of the assassination of rafiq hariri , its causes and consequences .
um , um ,
so are there any %pw ah ah references , perhaps , included in this statement as to any use of force against %pw syria for instance ?
there are no ah references to the use of force as i mentioned earlier . the ah the reference to or call for implementation of resolution fifteen fifty nine .
um , um ,
this call was dropped although the wording the council adopted still mentions lebanon restoring the integrity of its soil and its sovereignty , according to the expression utilized in the ah the ah statement .
of course , the statement calls on the lebanese ah government and all the lebanese people to work towards restoring ah lebanese sovereignty , as the statement put it , using peaceful means ; there is no mention of force or the use of violence .
so abd alreheem , as you are in the united nations and know what goes on behind closed doors at the united nations , what does dropping the call for the implementation of resolution fifteen fifty nine signify ?
of course the reference to resolution fifteen fifty nine drew plenty of attention .
and ah , the ah , it also resulted in discord within the council , because naturally , some countries were enthusiastic about the reference ; the united states , of course , and france which holds the same stance as the united states on this crisis .
there were other countries opposing the reference to resolution fifteen fifty nine including algeria which represents the arab group at the security council and other countries like china and ah brazil .
of course these countries which were opposing the reference to resolution nineteen fifty nine stated that the reference , that this reference politicizes the issue ,
and i think that the secretary - general of the united nations , kofi anan , ah said , stated ah or issued a statement to the same end .
the secretary - general said this morning that the statement needs to focus on the assassination and on the investigation without explicitly indicating it 's necessary , that it 's necessary to ah and necessary to drop the ah the reference to fifteen fifty nine .
it seems the security council reached a consensus that the reference to fifteen fifty nine politicizes the issue and therefore it was dropped .
just one last reference , because the americans here at the united nations say they offered to send the lebanese people a team from the fbi , ah , the american federal bureau of investigation and also from the bureau of alcohol , tobacco and firearms to investigate and run tests in lebanon relating to the assassination of hariri .
yes .
but they say the lebanese people refused that idea ; so far it has not been possible to gauge the lebanese reaction from the lebanese people themselves .
yes abd alreheem
abd alreheem faqar with that report for us from new york ; thanks to our correspondent .
and in a brief summary of what 's been mentioned so far , the security council has asked anan to submit an urgent report on the assassination of hariri , and it also condemned this assassination , demanding from the lebanese government that its mastermind and executors be put on trial .
and there is an important point , conveyed to us by our correspondent , namely that the dropping of the call in this statement for the implementation of resolution fifteen fifty nine on the basis that the security council reached a consensus that the reference to the implementation of this resolution comprizes excessive politicization of the issue .
back to our correspondent at the american state department , wajad waqfi .
wajad we were talking about the reason which led to a lack of ah mention ah even of an approximate date for the return of the ambassador to damascus .
yes , as you mentioned richard boucher did not specify any time frame for the return of margaret scooby , american ambassador to damascus ah to the syrian capital ,
ah , moreover , because he said she ah came to , ah she will come to washington for consultation and discussion regarding the assassination of former lebanese prime minister rafiq hariri ,
but i mean when i asked richard boucher about ah after he said and affirmed they %pw ah ah do not know the mastermind behind the assassination , nor do they have any clues to who is behind it ,
i asked him i mean ah %pw ah %pw ah if they are willing , in order to discover those behind the assassination , to participate in or support the french suggestion of conducting an international investigation into the case .
boucher replied that at the time , at the present time , they prefer ah ah that the lebanese conduct their investigation ah ah into the case ah on their own and that washington closely follow these investigations and the findings and after that the idea of an international investigation or the like can be discussed ,
but at the same time he pointed out that the the ah um the french suggestion is incomplete , since boucher stated that when france mentioned conducting an international investigation , it did not provide us with any details or any procedures for ah conducting any process of the kind .
but it is obvious i mean ah %pw i mean my colleague abd alreheem was speaking earlier about the fact that the united nations in its statement did not wish to politicize the issue .
but it seems clear in ah %pw during the announcement from the state department 's spokeman regarding the withdrawal of margaret scooby ah recalling her from washington ah from syria to washington that the subject was ah i mean politicized ah ah in ah in its entirety , in its entirety , ah since richard boucher spoke at length during his presentation of the justification for the decision , about the extent of american vexation over what he described as the syrian presence in lebanon .
and how great ah ah the chaos ah this presence causes to the lebanese in ah their everyday affairs and security affairs .
richard boucher considered that the reasons for the syrian presence ah ah no longer exist because of ah ah the elimination of security requisites that led syria to enter lebanon ; of course this is according to richard boucher the state department 's spokesman here .
thanks very much to you wagd wakfy from the american state department headquarters .
thus , we have been with you in a live coverage , distinguished viewers , on the urgent news item regarding the recalling by the the united states of its ambassador to damascus ,
and our coverage of the consequences of the assassination of former lebanese prime minister rafiq hariri is of course continuous and ah continual .
and now , back from the commercial break , let 's return to colleague faisal alkassem in a new episode of the opposite direction , revolving around the same topic .
is it reasonable that the lebanese opposition should play the role of prosecutor and judge at the same time ?
why such perilous haste in implicating syria in the assassination of rafiq hariri ?
is it reasonable that an event of such significance be determined in the media and political arena before it 's been resolved ?
is the one behind the crime also behind the accusation ?
one of our two guests asks :
how can a person in their right mind accuse the syrian regime ?
surely common sense discounts any suspicions of syria 's involvement in the assassination , asks azmi beshara ?
does it benefit syria which has great interests and around a million workers in lebanon to commit such a foolish deed ?
would it not be more logical to implicate the regional and international powers benefiting from destabilizing lebanon ?
is it in the interest of the lebanese government and syria to place lebanon in the international spotlight ?
did not the syrian secretary for migrant affairs stress that what is happening in lebanon is an episode in the series of events unfolding in palestine and iraq ?
is not the focus on the lebanese and syrian governments an overt attempt to divert attention from the real culprit ?
would it be reasonable to think that syria , which is at the core of the international tempest , caused by american and french pressures and international resolutions , could commit such an act that would escalate its crisis with the rest of the world ?
would syria commit such a suicidal act ?
do those calling for an international investigation benefit in any way from what is happening in lebanon ?
is there any connection between the assassination of hariri and the foreign plots that target the whole region ?
yet on the other hand , did not the syrian regime endure many international pressures and warnings after the extension of president lahud 's term ? but the syrian leadership was adamant and extended his term which made it liable to international resolution fifteen fifty nine ?
a syrian opponent asks :
has the the judicial system , run by arab intelligence services , ever been able to fairly investigate the most simple matters , let alone grave assassinations ?
a lebanese opponent asks :
so is it not france 's right to call for an international investigation ?
were not many lebanese figures killed while the identity of the murderers were not yet established ?
has not lebanon always been an arena for settling scores even if the price was destabilizing it and ruining it politically , economically and socially ?
are not the unjust internal syrian policies and the frozen external policies an indication that the regime hasn 't absorbed its lessons and doesn 't want reconciliation with its people or with the world ?
a syrian opponent asks :
is it reasonable that the syrian regime embarked on imposing phenomenal taxes on the crushed syrian people recently , while the country experiences all kinds of conspiracies , pressures and tremors ?
is this not an indication that the regime pays no heed on both the internal and external fronts ?
are the lebanese opposition 's accusations against syria motivated by scapegoating , or by the reality of its tragic experience with what it refers to as the syrian custodianship over lebanon ?
questions i 'm directing live on air via satellite from boston in america to professor walid fares , chief researcher at the institute for protecting democracies , which is in the inner circle of the american administration , and via satellite from beirut to ghaleb qandeel , member of the national council for information in lebanon .
we 'll commence the discussion after the break .
welcome again , our dear viewers , we come to you live on the opposite direction .
we apologize for not presenting the episode of new arab liberals and substitute it with an episode on the assassination of former lebanese prime minister rafiq hariri .
let 's start from boston with professor walid fares .
professor fares , at the start , is it not extremely unjust , i mean , that this grave event be settled in the media and in the political arena before the verdict is passed in the investigation ? %pw how , i mean , can the lebanese opposition and some pro - western entities , i mean , suddenly and without any prior warning point the finger of blame towards syria ? is this not quite unjust ?
no , for if the country were in natural circumstances , if we were %pw ah , for instance , if lebanon were as civil a society as sweden or new zealand , when a political crime takes place , of course , the local judicial systems and whoever wants to help them would be in charge .
but when such a crime takes place in light of an existing political conflict , the situation in lebanon is ah the ah outcome ah of two camps , one of which calls for the withdrawal of syrian forces , for fair elections , and for an end to human rights violations on the one hand , and on the other hand , there 's the syrian military presence and the lebanese regime allied with it .
and we know that in the last few months there have been other attempts , some of which of course struck or ah struck the convoy of one of the secretaries .
and years before that , there was a large - scale intelligence war declared on the opposition in lebanon ; therefore , when the lebanese opposition says we hold the syrian occupation responsible , then it is not actually waiting for the judicial systems to do anything about it , because it is at war and has received real threats including the threats it received the week preceding the assassination .
ah , um , ghalib kandel in beirut , you 've heard this comment , is it not unjust for the lebanese opposition to do this ?
ah , no doubt , the lebanese opposition includes a group of political forces , which are part and parcel of the fiber and structure of this country .
and it has the democratic right to adopt the position it chooses to , and to declare what it wants as %pw political propositions , plans and programs , that goes without saying , in principle .
but i think the media 's stance which prevailed after the assassination of the martyred former prime minister rafiq hariri is not in the interests of lebanon 's stability and civil peace in lebanon .
what was worrying all the lebanese people yesterday , following the assassination of a great national leader , namely rafiq hariri , was the fate of the country , its future and stability in general and in all domains .
if we closely examine the position prime minister hariri stands for , we can simply say that those applying pressures on lebanon and those applying pressures on syria are the ones profiting from this crime .
prime minister hariri was a man of moderation and his role was to achieve interconnection .
the last thing prime minister hariri said publicly was to the ambassador newspaper , he said he personally intervened immediately after the three protestos ? ? to stress the ta ' ef treaty and to lower the ceiling of the political message of the opposition .
and what his highness hassan nasrallah revealed a while ago , as we followed on aljazeera regarding frequent communications , the last of which was a week before the assassination of the martyred prime minister , about the role prime minister hariri was playing within the political process to mend the fractures and narrow the gap in points of view in an atmosphere of internal division , indicates that lebanon as a whole was targeted by this crime .
and i believe that at the media level we are called upon to reflect for a while and show clemency for the fate of our country because all the lebanese people don 't want this wicked assassination and this heinous crime to become like the assassination of national leader maarouf saad in seventy five
mr. walid fares you 've heard this remark , we are called upon to reflect and show clemency for the fate of this country and we should not rush publicly and politically to create more chaos .
you know what they say : he hit me and howled , and rushed first to cry foul
the crime is aimed at one of the most senior political sunni figures .
i do not claim all opposition parties shared his view , but practically speaking he was ah the national beiruti muslim political figure , who would have been able to mobilize the opposition camp in the next elections , the next parliamentary elections .
this is the reality of the situation now ah he talks about stability ; the assassination of hariri was an assassination of stability and there is no stability after this detestable crime .
nowadays the civil society in lebanon with nearly all its sects and with all its free political forces is quite aware this was a message , for he was not assassinated for financial or political partisan reasons .
this message was sent to all political forces so they would not exceed the ceiling of the political regional agenda imposed by syria , which is to support international intervention for the protection of lebanon 's sovereignty and the eviction of foreign forces .
and the elections which were going to take place and would have taken place if not prevented by hariri 's assassin , would have indicated to the world at large that there is a popular political and civil majority in lebanon comprising all sects who were demanding , demanding in a very obvious manner the intervention of civil society to support this country in its quest for liberation .
and of course today when the french government , supported by the american government and i think even the security council , look into this matter of there being an international investigation , an international investigation of this crime , and this does not mean only the one who carried out the operation but also the one who issued the political order ; which institution , which state , which regime , which organization was behind this ?
and we will see when this investigation takes place , or even if it 's prevented , we will see exactly who is politically responsible for this operation , the main objective of which is to thwart the lebanese people 's attempts to restore their sovereignty .
ghalib kandel , a preemptive strike against elections
this rhetoric overlooks a collection of solid facts , the first of which is that silvan shalom was the first one to lay the accusation against syria immediately after the crime took place .
and we know how concerned israel is with the stability of lebanon and the interests of lebanon .
israelis put syria and lebanon in the crossfire to serve their schemes in the region .
the other incident is that the last two actions prime minister hariri took according to what the newspapers in beirut have reported today were : first , he called ambassador walid almuallim and asked him to resume his meetings in beirut as soon as possible , requesting a private audience with him within the context of narrowing the gap in viewpoints between the lebanese opposition parties and the syrian leadership .
and secondly , what prime minister hariri did in his last days before the horrific assassination that shook all of lebanon , is he sent a letter to prime minister omar karami , with the two journalists who were expected to meet him yesterday afternoon , the gist of which was asking the government to take the initiative in toning down the extreme internal division within the country .
the other incident was a videotape broadcast by aljazeera regarding who committed the crime , and which contains a claim of responsibility by an extremist organization .
and prime minister hariri is one of the symbols of moderation , not only in lebanon but all over the arab region , in combating the fever of extremism and terrorism the region is experiencing .
moreover , syria is the true front for resisting this terrorism .
i believe laying the accusation on syria in some of the media rhetoric we receive is a continuation of the assassination crime .
mr. walid fares , you 've heard this argument ,
and how would you explain this , you know , ah obvious harmony between your rhetoric and the israeli media rhetoric regarding the assassination , i mean , of rafiq hariri as we heard from mr. kandel ?
this is on one hand ; on the other hand , i mean , i mean who would believe , who would believe that syria which is at the core of the international tempest exemplified in french and american pressures , international resolutions , pressures and sieges , and all these things , could commit such a foolish act ?
i mean shouldn 't we display some insight , some intelligence ? brilliant and we %pw , from from which , i mean , can we lay accusations unjustifiably in this way ?
insight and intelligence , ah my dear , ah are what tell us or we can analyze through them the following points , and i have some answers to some issues .
if we look at all or most assassinations , especially in lebanon , or even in the region but in lebanon in particular we can see that each assassination of this sort targets a political figure or a leading figure in lebanon that was opposed to the syrian presence in lebanon .
we can see that there is an organization ah making an announcement so we do not see this organization before the assassination nor hear about it after the assassination .
so why , for example , if it were actually a jihad organization , was no official statement made by al-qaeda nor did the operations ' division on the internet publish this subject ?
it , it is a vague statement that was ah made so that practically it would not be said that there is a body behind this operation whether directly or indirectly .
there is someone whose home was raided and there is evidence , and there is a dna test being run by the lebanese authorities .
of course .
the issue is not , i mean , the issue is not ah merely a media affair ; these are events that need to be followed up , and there is an investigation being conducted by the lebanese authorities .
terrific and we % pw
okay if you examined this intelligence information , right
okay , great , if you studied the intelligence information then
go ahead .
if you read the intelligence science , you would be able to see that in the history of intelligence , especially baathist intelligence ,
i have no experience in intelligence , i mean , %pw i am specialized in media .
if you read , i am not saying that you have experience , i don 't either ; if you read books on the subject of intelligence since the days of the soviet kjb , it is possible to create organizations that do not practically know they exist thanks to an intelligence service .
that is why the united states and france and a significant sector of civil society in lebanon and even ah the arab states , will demand an international investigation , because the assassination has international dimensions , i mean in all cases , the issue of israel , i mean whenever anything happens in the region , israel is held responsible ,
and the the arab regimes made us accustomed to believe that whatever problems they have among themselves , israel is to blame .
dr. azmi beshara , dr. azmi bshara is not a syrian official , he is a friend of all the opponents in lebanon and he is an expert on israeli affairs .
and they were accused , they %pw the the iraqis were accused %pw the iraqis were accused .
allow me .
okay , go ahead .
%pw azmi beshara supports syria , %pw azmi beshara supports syria ; he is the main lobbyist in israel and the territories .
azmi beshara is a palestinian national figure who is a friend of the senior opposition figures in lebanon .
and azmi bashra is an expert on israeli affairs and when he makes such an assumption he must have his reasons , his facts and his information .
moreover , israel has two vendettas against hariri , the neesan accord vendetta , after he employed all his international connections to reinforce recognizing the legality of lebanese resistance , and another vendetta for his role in reviving lebanon 's economic role which represents a threat to israeli aspirations for the region 's future .
great , great , great , i have a question then ,
and %pw consequently this is just an analysis we do not have any facts .
how can you say , how can you say great ? i i am talking about the analysis , how can you say israel is responsible and a jihad organization is responsible ?
you must choose one of the scenarios .
there are two theories , you analyze , you you judge intentions by accusing syria , you , you accuse , you build your accusations on the basis of intentions , and we deduce via analysis .
it cannot be both israel and the jihadists .
the , the , the main theory nowadays is in the hands of the opposition , who say they received threats , ( come on people ) and janbalat says he has %pw received threats .
yes , go ahead .
as for the international movement , it is clearly an attempt to take advantage of the crime in order to achieve two objectives : fueling internal division in lebanon resulting in more internal instability , and widening the circle of international intervention . and both these issues are not in lebanon 's interests .
lebanon needs national unity more than ever , so it can utilize this unity to discuss all issues in a national dialogue .
okay .
and secondly , lebanon needs to strengthen its immunity in confronting the pressures which have israel 's interest at the core of their conditions .
thank you , thank you very much
we will return , dear viewers , after the news update from the newsroom . until we meet .
we have made it clear from the beginning of my administration that it is incumbent upon syria that its territories not be used to support international terrorist groups .
we expect syria to comply with resolution 1500,950 that demands the withdrawal of its forces from lebanon , and help in organizing free and fair elections in lebanon .
these are very reasonable demands , all of which seek to ensure that the world is more secure .
we are seeking to work with our friends the europeans during my coming trip to seek avenues of joint cooperation between us to urge syria to take more rational decisions .
president bush speaking at his press conference about the american demand uh of uh syria
uh , ambassador walid al-mouallem , syrian deputy foreign minister , ( ( may ) ) we hear your comments about what you heard on this program , and also the set of american demands that are presented now to damascus ?
first , brother hafez , i want to remind you from the standpoint of my experience that there is not one list of american demands .
there is an unlimited list of demands . whenever we are finished with one demand , other demands follow it .
this is the custom with the united states
because basically the defect is not in syrian foreign policy , the defect is in the american foreign policy vis - a - vis the region .
unfortunately , in this region the united states plays a role that serves the interests of israel .
and i want to remind the friend martin indyk when i met him the first time in washington , i asked him how can we improve the american - syrian relations ?
so he laughed and said that , with respect to israel it is a zero sum game and consequently , it is difficult to improve the america - syrian relation unless israel approves .
second , resolution 1559 , we in syria respect it and consider it international law .
but how about resolution 242 , and 338 , and 425 , and others among dozens of resolutions issued by the security council and which israel did not implement , aren 't they international law ?
why this duplicity in position toward security council resolutions ?
even resolution 425 that was issued by the security council in 1978 , who implemented it ? is it the security council or the national resistance in lebanon that implemented it ?
and it implemented it and forced israel to withdraw from most lebanese territories ,
and so in order to be fair this effort should be directed .
all of us together in order to implement security council resolutions and in order to give back to the united nations its credibility on the international scene , not for superpowers to dominate the resolutions of these united nations .
in relation to what my brother mohammad shatah said , i assure brother mohammad shatah , indeed a long and deep lebanese - syrian relation that has flaws ,
and the mission entrusted to me by mr. president is for me to work for the establishment of relations between the institutions of the two countries , relations that the citizens of the two countries can benefit from .
and i , during my last visit to beirut , i met for two hours with the late martyr rafik hariri , and we sat down and discussed my mission and the flaws , and he handed me %pw and he asked me to transmit a message to mr. president bashar al-assad .
i realized that his message was positive , and so i asked him
why don 't you transmit it yourself to damascus ?
he said i am ready , damascus is my second city , but i will work closely with you for two things : first , to make your mission succeed in lebanon because it is a noble mission .
and second to prepare for a meeting with his excellency president bashar al-assad that is fruitful and useful for the two countries .
and we stayed in touch
and you may find it strange that the last call i received from the late martyr rafik hariri was five hours before his death ,
when he drew my attention to what he said to the newspaper as - safir on the 14th , on monday the 14th of february , february ,
he said to me , read , this is my position , i am acting under the umbrella of taef .
if we are loyal to the blood of the martyr , this is what we should work for .
uh , your excellency , ambassador , your excellency , ambassador ,
uh , right , right , your excellency , ambassador , we have a mission , and a mission uh uh , well , that cannot be delayed
uh and we and and syria , i mean our relationship together , is a close relationship and an unusual relationship , and it has been affirmed as an excellent relationship .
but we cannot begin to fix the problem by saying that there is an excellent relationship that has some flaws .
uh , i mean , the the , candor in the , uh , the lebanese - syrian relationship is needed .
there is a relationship %pw , it has continued for years and i disagree uh , with uh , mr. indyk that the operation has been going on for months , it has been an unhealthy relationship for years , uh , obviously during which good things happened , but it now it requires a serious reevaluation .
uh , when the , uh ambassador friend walid al-mouallem came over to uh beirut uh , well , we foresaw a good omen , first because we know uh uh his ability uh to convince and be clear uh in addition to his many friendships ,
but the issue is not about friendships , and so uh he is a charming person , and he comes with good intentions , he had to convince the lebanese that the issue was not , i mean , to chat with this %pw or that - politician or or this %pw or that person ,
of course , uh , his conversation with uh the , the martyr rafik hariri , we are hearing some of its details now , that does not eliminate
the real and very big problem and which the lebanese people expressed in all their communities . the problem says that we are not divided now ,
we are all arab lebanese ,
we are all now on one path at the national level and in helping syria and the , the brothers in palestine to achieve uh their legitimate demands ,
but now we do not need guardianship or tutelage or someone deciding for the lebanese people who will be its president , and who will be its prime minister , and who will be ,
and i won 't , you know , enumerate the many important milestones that were passed , which convinced the lebanese
i mean , you can convince mohammad shatah of it , you know , by discussing it between you and him ,
but it 's important to convince the lebanese that no , this is all wrong , or that it was right uh syria deciding uh to extend for example , and that is not right for the president of the republic , with my strong respect for the post of the president of the republic and the , and to the president of the republic , that this uh , you know , it 's true it happened by a syrian decision , but but that was wrong ,
from now on , we will begin a very different relationship , based on uh uh the independence of lebanese decision - making , in , in , in a real sense and not in a sense that is , you know , legal or contrived or hypothetical .
let me hear also from the , uh , ambassador martin indyk before i return to uh the deputy minister uh al-mouallem .
first , i would like to clarify that ambassador al-mouallem is a %pw close friend of mine , and i have a great deal of %pw respect for him , his person , his dignity and uh his integrity .
and the role he played to achieve peace between syria and israel is a great role and also protecting the interests of syria .
and that %pw and in this context , i would like to plead with him , since he is now in charge of the syrian - lebanese relations , to ensure that , uh that he sees that the situation now requires a redefinition of this relationship between the two countries .
i was recently in lebanon and i did not hear from anybody , and i spoke with many lebanese from , %pw , in the opposition , the so - called opposition , i did not hear anyone not saying that we will always have a special relation with syria .
this is an uh undisputed fact in lebanon , at least for the present time .
but what is unacceptable or what is no longer acceptable now , and uh , and and i think that %pw , and as ambassador shatah said , that the lebanese no longer accept this , and not the international powers , and not the great powers , %pw , uh france and the united states ,
the entire world no longer accepts that lebanon remains in the treatment of the situation in lebanon this way , either through the presence of foreign forces in it , through uh their interference in uh lebanese politics ,
and that syria can protect its interests in lebanon .
and i think in all sincerity that it can protect its interests without interfering in the internal and , the , affairs and of lebanon .
and i hope that ambassador al-mouallem uh with the responsibilities he bears , will lead the way in that direction ,
because this will not be for syria and lebanon only , but so that we can avoid what i fear , what i fear is an escalating position that is not in the interests of any party .
your excellency ambassador al-mouallem , i am listening to uh , to your comment or response .
first , in fact , i did not hear well what martin said , but i would like to add to what my brother said
would you like me to summarize it ?
i would like that
uh , so he said that during his last visit to lebanon , there %pw uh %pw uh was an emphasis on the special relationship with lebanon
but syria must quickly , especially with you having the portfolio now , the portfolio of the relationship with lebanon , that you lead the way and get syria out of this predicament irrespective of any other issues .
brother hafez , first i had the opportunity to visit lebanon only once .
then this tragic horrific event happened that took away the life of prime minister hariri .
prime minister hariri was a partner of mine , a bridge that wants to connect the two sides , a party calling for the taef umbrella and a party calling for resolution 1559 and betting on the outside .
prime minister hariri wanted to make a bridge for dialogue between the two parties , this is first .
second , in my dialogue with the lebanese opposition , it was the first dialogue session ,
and does my brother mohammad shatah think i have a magic wand that turns things upside down immediately and lebanon is on the eve of elections within three months ?
the dialogue with the opposition and the loyalists , as they are called in lebanon , a useful , honest and constructive dialogue ,
and through it , i took away many things , and that dialogue must continue until we reach common points over which we can share together , both sides together , in outlining the future of the syrian - lebanese relations , a future not in slogans , and not to say an excellent relationship .
we wanted to lay the groundwork for this relationship .
unfortunately , this ugly crime in beirut has had a profound impact on my mission because it deprived me of a true partner who called for national unity in lebanon .
that is in fact , it cannot be said that one session or one visit to beirut would have been a magic wand .
we were engaged in a continuous dialogue
ok your excellency , ambassador , if you allow me
yes , please allow me , at least if you were not , i mean your awareness %pw with what goes on in lebanon and now you want to be entrusted with the visit to beirut , this is something new and important , your association with the american relations dossier
and all of us here on this program , we have known you for more than 10 years , you are fully aware of the american relations dossier , with washington ,
don 't you think that irrespective of any other circumstances uh familiar or new , that there is now an event that damascus must take the initiative on and not let the matter uh deteriorate ?
the , the iraq issue can be discussed uh , %pw after other issues , but the lebanese issue , in order not lose the arab support for the syrian position with america
first of all , brother hafez
please go ahead
brother hafez , you know well that the core of what is going on between us and the united states is iraq and not lebanon .
i was told by a senior american official that lebanon is %pw thousands of miles away from the united states , but iraq is in the home of every american , that 's another issue .
i say no one in the whole world cares for lebanon , its security , stability , national unity , and strategic interests as syria does , not in a sentimental way , but because there are common interests in this matter ,
the security and stability of lebanon are part of the security and stability of syria , and vice - versa .
our common interests are clear , we are %pw we stand in one trench , confronting a conflict that has not yet been resolved with israel .
we had hoped that it would be resolved through negotiations that lasted ten years , and the friend martin indyk participated effectively in them and he knows who thwarted the negotiations and who thwarted the failure to reach a peace agreement .
ok , let me turn to martin indyk
and specifically you said that the issue is not lebanon but iraq
uh , martin indyk , in statements uh uh he made today in the washington post , he says the issue is not uh uh lebanon but hezbollah and israel and there is more danger
do you see , mr. indyk that uh what he is saying that maybe the agenda is to isolate hezbollah uh once uh and that the issue is part of the israeli interests uh not from lebanon , not iraq
the president mentioned and talked about iraq
and and he said that %pw syria supports terrorist acts coming uh the in iraq
and he mentioned uh his support to , the support of syria to palestinian activists who carry out acts of violence .
he also talked about lebanon and all these three issues uh are on president bush 's agenda .
i , uh , i saw that the president % pw
and and he had arrived to a strategy for uh handling this situation
and this by
and stopping the support offered to the , uh , to the rebels who , who enter iraq by way of syria and if this is done the matter would be over ,
and and i think that president assad , um , um , um , if he were to extend his hand to israel and say that he is ready to negotiate with it , and also that his discussions with %pw about reducing the support offered to , the the palestinian organizations that %pw resort to violence , if he were to do this , then he would be able to get himself out of that position ,
but now and as a result of the assassination of the - late prime minister - hariri , the three items have become focused and have coalesced together in his agenda ,
and i think that some steps have been taken regarding this matter
and %pw that president bush has recognized that syria has taken some steps to - prevent the - support to the iraqi rebels
but that was not enough , because they have to , it won 't be enough to remove the item from the agenda .
and so we find that the three subjects are now on the agenda and i think that the main problem for syria , and that %pw , that syria has become %pw isolated .
and it is paradoxical that there is no other issue on which %pw uh , %pw france and and the united states agree and cooperate on , and it is the issue of syria and lebanon .
and therefore , instead of %pw the , seeking iran and the - and going to it and obtaining its support , i think it would have been %pw uh more appropriate and more effective , and i say this as a person who cares for syria , i think it would have been ( ( ) ) more appropriate for , for syria to find a way to deal with each of these three positions
especially , and as i said %pw to look into their way of uh redefining its relations with lebanon and %pw in a way , to preserve its basic interests and at the same time that lebanon can become a free country .
the conversation that took place now between uh our friend in the , ambassador al-mouallem and ambassador indyk , really points one more time to the fact that some look at lebanon as if it was a pawn in uh , i mean uh in a big chess game that encompasses iraq , iran and maybe wider uh than that .
well , without , you know , speaking in in a very parochial manner , you know , for the lebanese , lebanon is a country that has seen too many bumps , too many wars , uh over the past 15 years , since about ' 90 , it 's trying to build a country on new foundations with institutions .
the , the syrian brothers helped in the , the beginning and they still help in some , %pw , aspects
but the lebanese have now reached a consensus that uh the assistance that syria provided , has now changed into a strangling cord for , you know , robbing the lebanese of their will , even denying them the exercise of their decisions and their institutions .
the friend uh ambassador al-mouallem spoke about syria caring for the security of lebanon and no one cares for lebanon like syria does ,
there may be one group only that cares %pw at least to the same extent if not more , that is the lebanese people .
syria should not be afraid of the lebanese people .
let the lebanese people be by your side , your friends , and allow them to build their country , they have one country .
and i say that the syrians , the syrian brothers , when they build a relationship that is not theoretical , that is serious , in a way that has full respect for sovereignty and decision - making , syria uh becomes stronger uh against any outside party , be it in the big issues or the , the , the national and the , and the regional issues .
ok
unfortunately the time for the program is almost over and so i have about a minute , i will take the final word from ambassador walid al-mouallem .
i did not hear the question .
brother hafez , i did not hear .
your excellency the ambassador , did you hear ?
you did not hear me , uh uh , i will take a final word from you in %pw , i will take a final word from you ,
now , now i hear you ,
can you hear me ?
yes .
uh one last word from you in the minute we have left on the program ,
and uh perhaps you heard ambassador indyk , and you also heard ambassador shatah say that lebanon should not be uh a pawn uh pawn of chess ,
there is a purely lebanese issue that should be resolved irrespective of iraq , and the , and the , and the strategic issues of syria in the middle east .
brother hafez , i want to assure you , and the brothers watching , and brother mohammad shatah whom i highly esteem , that syria does not deal with lebanon as a chess pawn , but it deals with lebanon as a nation and as a state with all its due respect , sovereignty and independence .
this i assure it to it , and from this comes the importance of building a strategic relationship between syria and lebanon .
we do not compromise with anyone over the vital interests of lebanon , and that is why we are suffering from all the outside pressures , be they american or french .
second ,
your excellency the ambassador , in the half a minute remaining , with washington , how do you see the relationship %pw , if you would summarize it for us at the end of the program , or how %pw do you see %pw want it to be ?
relationship between whom and whom ?
washington and damascus
washington , we want a natural relationship
but can the united states free itself from the israeli influence in order to build that relationship ?
we want a natural relationship , and a constructive dialogue , and a dialogue that benefits the real interests of the united states and syria and the arab world ,
yes
can the united states do that ?
thanks .
thank you uh very much
uh , unfortunately time does not , not allow me to go back to the other guests ,
ambassador martin indyk , uh , with us , participated with us in this program , i thank him ,
ambassador walid al-mouallem , syria deputy foreign minister , and ambassador mohammad shatah , the former lebanese ambassador , i thank them all .
and i thank the program team in doha and our colleagues at the office uh of al-jazeera in damascus and our office in new york and the colleagues there who managed the preparation and presentation of this program with me uh in washington , with their greetings , and my greetings , hafez al-mirazi .
the conditions of democracy and uh human rights in the arab world , we discussed them in the first part of the program from washington on the basis of the 28th annual report of the american state department on human rights in the world .
and we try in the second part of the program to focus on whether washington has succeeded with its pressures in - achieving some reforms in the arab world ?
given what we see of what is now called by american officials as the cedar revolution in lebanon , and uh those popular movements that led to the resignation of the government ?
also , uh , the constitutional reforms that were proposed by egyptian president hosni mubarak and which mean uh uh uh a plurality of parties and a plurality in the candidates , and not only a referendum .
uh , there are also the syrian movements to comply with some of the american demands .
does this mean that uh washington 's language has succeeded ,
that bush was right when he went to iraq uh as some american commentators are saying ?
this is what i will discuss with my guests on the program
dr. amr hamzawy , the expert at the carnegie endowment for international peace here in the american capital washington ,
dr. naguib alghadhban , professor of political science at the university of arkansas and our guest today in the american capital ,
and with us from new york , dr. fawaz girgis , professor of political science at sarah lawrence university .
uh , welcome to you all .
uh , dr. fawaz , uh , the main question that i posed , uh , did washington 's pressures succeed in achieving reform ?
uh , in reality , the administration of , uh , w bush is trying , and the supporters of the administration , uh , to benefit from , uh , you know , %pw the winds which , the winds of reform , are blowing in the region and say that the fact is that the american war on iraq and the liberation of the iraqi people from the grip of the baathist regime , uh , you know , and helping the iraqis to go to %pw the ballot boxes , uh , led , uh , to , uh , led to a kind of , well , influence in on the arab political , uh , arena .
and as you mentioned , hafez , you know , the story that is running around in the influential media circles in the united states is that the american war in iraq and the liberation of the %pw iraqi people are like an active and fast locomotive that cannot be stopped at %pw the iraqi borders .
and thus , the fact ( clears throat ) is that there are , uh , three , main points in this , uh , regard .
the first point , i don 't think one can structurally link what is going on and what happened in iraq with the winds of change blowing on the arab arena .
the second point , uh , on this subject has to do with these american pressures by the greatest , uh , power in the world , the pressures focused by the american administration on the issue of reform and democracy have in fact begun to have an effect on the arab arena .
and that effect is due , as we know , to the weakness and fragility of arab regimes and , uh , there is a huge ( clears throat ) gap between the arab regimes and their peoples , and therefore these monuments , uh , the regimes are fragile and cannot withstand this focused pressure by , uh , the superpower , uh , in the world .
and the last point , in fact , irrespective of how we see the american war in iraq , it seems that the activation of political life in iraq will have an impact on the arab political arena ,
and as the lebanese leader , uh , walid jumblatt , %pw and who was one , uh , of of the strongest opponents of the american war in iraq ,
he said several days ago that , in fact , he was affected to a large degree when he saw the millions of iraqis going to the ballot boxes in spite of the dangers that faced these millions ,
therefore , arab opposition movements are trying to leverage this political climate and , uh , what is going on in iraq in order to , in fact , increase the pressure on , uh , the arab regimes
yes .
and irrespective of our view of the american war , uh , in iraq , it seems that activating %pw the political society in iraq will positively impact the arab political scene in general .
yes .
dr. amr .
well , to begin with , i will differ with dr. fawaz in one of his three assumptions ,
i think that the undemocratic uh uh arab regimes , the authoritarian arab regimes have wide latitude and a great capacity to resist the outside pressures and that is what these regimes have proved during the past two decades .
i think it is difficult to talk about arab regimes that are fragile or that are highly susceptible to the influence of outside pressures because experience , the experience of the arab region during the past two decades has proved otherwise .
the second assumption i have is in fact that these regimes are now responding to internal pressures , and that is the main transformation and the central transformation that is occurring in the arab region .
we have a civil society in lebanon that has discovered a national patriotic identity that transcends ethnic and racial hurdles which , in previous stages , affected the evolution of political events in lebanon ,
we have a civil society in egypt that discovers that it has the ability to pressure and to move in the egyptian street and to cause %pw , %pw , i mean , at least , uh , to force the regime to reconsider a number of principal issues and premises , something the regime had rejected in the past .
we have civil societies in iraq and in saudi arabia and elsewhere that are moving , these then are internal pressures .
the third assumption i have , i want here to rephrase what dr. fawaz said but in a different format ,
of course , there is an international environment , a worldwide environment that does not approve of the existence of undemocratic regimes , it puts pressure in order to cause democratic changes and reforms .
it is an international environment that is present in the united states of america and in the european union and elsewhere , but the effectiveness of this international environment will remain ultimately dependent on the amount of internal pressures ,
when the cost for the authoritative regime changes into a higher cost , the undemocratic ruler reconsiders %pw uh , the main priorities and reevaluates the premises on which he manages the political process .
and %pw the ruler in , the international system , uh , re - reassesses the value of that local ruler to serve it or not , or to achieve stability for it or not , dr , naguib .
yes yes , %pw , yes %pw , absolutely .
well , between the two opinions , i find myself agreeing with some of the points , i agree and , you know , with dr. fawaz and dr. amr on some of them and i focus on whether president bush 's administration has succeeded ?
i think yes by putting forth a democratic agenda ,
dr. amr , it is true that we have a movement of civil society in egypt , we have a protest movement in lebanon , but the repressive apparatuses in these countries were able , over long periods of time , to contain them ,
so putting forward this agenda is important but , uh , the american administration has not succeeded in trying to advance democracy through war .
the question here on the subject of iraq is the cost , the enormous human and material cost ,
the bush administration , uh , so far has spent $ 210 us billion
and it wants to put , uh , you know , a budget of three ( cough ) million dollars on the iraq war to encourage democracy , i think if it were to spend half %pw %pw , you know , of the cost of the war on the democracy project in the arab region , all the arab countries would have become by now prosperous democratic countries .
a point , a point , mr. hafez . . .
but that is not the . .
i will get back to you dr. fawaz , but i also want to add to the dialogue , and maybe it will side with your point of view , uh , fawaz , %pw the american view may be different , and and there is no problem , %pw , the new york times newspaper in , uh , its march 1st issue , uh , march , says in its main editorial that the bush administration has the right to attribute to itself a great deal of merit in a lot of the progress that has been achieved ,
of course ,
it has adopted courageously the cause of democracy in the middle east at a time when few in the west saw any real chance of this happening .
the similar challenge facing washington right now is to find a way to shepherd and encourage these tendencies that remain fragile without destroying them by embracing the , uh , uh , ( clears throat ) zealous winner .
dr. fawaz , ( ( ) ) warning that the bush administration also can harm the reform tendencies when it appears to be implementing an outside agenda .
uh , the fact is , %pw %pw the important theoretical question , i , in %pw in the three points which i , tried , really , to put the points on %pw the table ,
the first theoretical point is that one cannot separate %pw %pw the outside factor from the inside factor ,
in theory , one cannot separate , especially , especially in societies such as ours that are deeply penetrated , deeply penetrated
and then , really , the issue the theoretical question is not , uh , what is the weight of the internal factor in comparison with the external factor , but rather the timing of the internal aspirations , the internal pressure of arab societies , with the focused international pressure , and not only by the american administration , but also by , uh , uh , the european countries and also the arab peoples ,
the fact is that to the extent that the penetrated arab regimes can , and then really here the depth and the fragile and the fragility in depth because the truth , uh , i mean , the steadfastness in front of , uh , its peoples , uh , you know , the societies %pw , can , %pw the arab regimes can , you know what , violate human rights and strike at the aspirations , uh , of their peoples , but they cannot withstand the pressure , the winds of change coming from the outside and the inside ,
yes .
and then , really , the importance of the question lies in the extent to which the arab regimes are able to establish a genuine partnership with their civil societies and , uh , %pw %pw this societal civil partnership can enable the %pw arab regimes and arab societies to withstand , uh , focused foreign pressures , particularly from %pw %pw the american administration
yes .
and also , and also really the question , the single point is that there is not only an internal and an external factor , there is a %pw an organic and a structural link between the outside and the inside in the reform process in the arab region .
yes .
i mean , it , i mean %pw , there is certainly a link between the internal and external factors . certainly also , and i think , you know , at another level , other than the debate , or outside the academic debate that that that that that , uh , you know , %pw , we invest more time in discussing to what extent they are internal factors , what are the external factors , is in the end a waste of time , and we are not cognizant of the importance of the present moment that exists in the arab region ,
true , true .
we have to look in depth to what is happening in in lebanon to , in depth to what is happening in saudi arabia and egypt , and other arab countries to realize the importance of the present moment .
the second point i think , is when , you know , we put a , uh , stamp , uh , of some kind on arab regimes and say that they are fragile and penetrated , we in a scientific and academic manner we are generalizing , uh , i think , uh , %pw , and in the absence of historic precedents ( laugh ) . arab regimes are like any other existing regimes , they are subject to various influences , some internal and some external ,
but to talk in general about a generalization about fragile and penetrated regimes is , i think , inconsistent with a part of the arab fact .
dr. naguib .
they are undoubtedly regimes that are penetrated from the outside and i think that part of this american agenda for encouraging democracy is in refraining from supporting these regimes .
uh , let us bring here what president bush said , that the united states supported these regimes for about 60 years and its concern was the situation then and stability in the region ,
and stability .
so the refraining and converting to set the agenda for democracy , this is a positive development ,
but what i want to say , and i agree with you dr. amr in relation to it , the issue is now not an issue of the inside and the outside , the issue now is that there is a decisive historic moment in the entire region and one must take this step forward .
the administration now really has before it %pw an opportunity to move that process forward ,
i mean , what happened in egypt for example is a symbolic change that needs a push ,
needs to make sure that there is , yes , yes , i mean there is no doubt that there are two kinds of responses to these pressures , a kind of giving in and making concessions , that 's the qadhafi model or the model of inviting sharon to tunis ,
they will really be free elections , and competitively democratic until it reaches its natural outcome .
but but yes
%pw , allow me , but there are those %pw who may see that , uh , merely offering the price that washington is demanding on the %pw term , either by inviting sharon to save yourself or going to sharon at a conference , uh , or anything that has to do with sharon , as if this is the solution or the way out ,
let us listen to another comment by the syrian ambassador to the arab journalists in washington about , " do you want me to get out of the washington problem ? "
that is the solution .
syria immediately issues an invitation to sharon to visit damascus .
it announces that it will concede the golan to israel , meaning that we could for example reach an agreement to raise %pw uh , the syrian flag along with the israeli flag on the golan and , uh , the golan is managed by israel
and uh , uh , , %pw , %pw we help we help , uh , the forces of good against the forces of evil in lebanon , especially hezbollah ,
we do this and the united states will no longer be concerned with any of the issues that it is raising about syria .
dr. naguib alghadhban , you are closely familiar with the syrian situation
or other models , but even in the case of syria , you know , what %pw the ambassador said is really a word of truth that is intended to be trifle ,
in the sense that syria who is using this issue , the issue of steadfastness in the palestinian issue and defiance etc . , in order to %pw %pw to delay the reform process and uh the %pw democracy process ,
it is also making concessions ,
it made concessions in the iraqi issue , it is conceding in the palestinian issue and now ( clears throat ) in the lebanese issue ,
yes ,
and consequently , uh , these regimes have to realize that their principal point of vulnerability is the question of dictatorship and despotism
and that at any moment , the united states will use this point when it agrees with its interests .
%pw , %pw , i disagree on two issues ,
i think the first issue is the terms we use in addressing the present arab situation ,
%pw , the terms of pressure on one hand , and compliance on the other , %pw uh , repression , oppression , despotism and lack of democracy , i think we ought to rethink our terminology .
we have a situation in motion in the arab world ,
forces of civil society contribute to this situation in motion , some elements , uh , inside the arab elites contribute to it , and they are more receptive to reformist ideas .
ultimately we have an international environment ,
we have %pw , a group of three main factors that contribute to the push ,
that may contribute to the push towards democracy ,
we must not , to begin with , dismiss the arab regimes by talking about their fragility and their penetration because ultimately the one who produced the constitutional amendment in egypt is the president of the republic .
no , to the contrary , no , never
dr. fawaz .
the critical question is the following , do we have any tangible evidence in reality in reality , the , and the centrality , that the arab regimes , including the egyptian regime and the syrian regime , are really serious to begin putting in place constitutional modalities to achieve the desired reform ?
this is a very important question .
you tell me , you tell me , mr. professor , that it is the egyptian president who took that important step
several weeks ago , when he was asked about reforms , the %pw egyptian president said
these
this means not serious , these reforms have no meaning at all ,
and therefore i go back to the main point , hafez
the timing , the timing of external pressures that are focused on a fragile regime that depends on huge financial sources from the outside , with with the aspirations of the egyptian people and uh an active domestic movement , made and pushed the egyptian regime , the egyptian president to try , really , ( clears throat ) to absorb absorb this anger and stop this strong tide
and to try , really , you know the question is not , what is the step ?
we have to wait and see if this step constitutes a process , constitutes a major step in a major reform process and not a step to bide time and absorb the popular anger inside egypt .
yes , ok .
and the question here .
ok , let 's see , ok dr. %pw , dr. , please , uh , dr. fawaz , let 's see for example , we return one more time to the american press in order to connect what we say here with what , uh , american commentators say to the american public ,
jackson diehl in the washington post newspaper was one of the more or of the quickest commentaries that were published in the american press about the step taken by president mubarak ,
jackson diehl said in his article in the washington post the following :
except that mubarak took the most courageous step
and one of the reasons for doing that is that his fears of the beirut uprising are almost equivalent to the fears of assad ,
forcing syria to withdraw from lebanon may lead to the toppling of the assad family in damascus .
in any case , in the absence of syrian repression , the lebanese parliamentary elections in may will be the third free and democratic elections in the arab world this year ,
this means that it will be impossible politically ( clears throat ) for mubarak to renew his term through blunt undemocratic means .
let 's go also to the article by david ignatius of wednesday 's washington post
david says we are seeing a series of wonderful falterings in the middle east
the old regime that previously appeared stable has started tearing apart and crumbling
one column toppling another column .
the sudden pressure that led to the series of falterings was the american invasion of iraq two years ago .
but this arab structural system was rotten and eroded at the core for decades ,
but the real power that toppled it is the popular anger ,
dr. amr
yes , well %pw certainly %pw %pw there is an impetus for a , uh , popular movement present in lebanon , in egypt , present in a number of other arab societies to put pressure in the direction of democratic reforms .
i reassert that the outside pressures have been with us for a long time , they have somewhat increased in the past years .
no , not all ,
it is not correct for us to speak one time about outside pressures that were %pw , existed for a long time ,
absolutely not true .
no , no , no , well , i disagree with dr. fawaz , yes ( ( ) ) on the issue .
dr. naguib , ok , listen to dr. naguib .
the fact is %pw , let 's go back to the basic point that it is not important to what extent the pressure is external or internal , ( ( however ) ) there is agreement , there is agreement .
( ( yeah , listen ) ) true , yes
but also , uh , i mean , there comes here a third factor and it is the mistakes of those regimes ,
i mean the degree of political stagnation in some of these countries has gotten to a point where they started making flagrant mistakes ,
let me mention the syrian situation for example , the insistence by the syrian leadership to renew , uh , another term %pw for lahoud at a time when all the lebanese lebanese political forces opposed such a move ,
and at a time when the international orientation is towards increasing transparency , democratic openness , and so forth .
so it is in the nature of these regimes , also by %pw their cumulative mistakes , that they really contribute to driving civil society and outside forces , in that they also assist in
. . ( ( ) ) the process of putting an end to this , the
dr. naguib , but aren 't there major differences in the ability of several arab regimes to read through the local , regional and international environments ,
and the lack of that ability in other cases ? i think that we ought to clarify the major differences .
of course
of course , no doubt .
in the saudi case for example , the transformation , %pw in some way , towards reforms of a discussion about democracy , then a major step in the elections , did this come about only because of the existence of outside pressures ?
or is there an awareness inside certain circles in the saudi elite of the importance of reform ?
what i want to say , and i think here , i mean maybe the principal extent of difference with dr. fawaz is not so much the question of the existence of fragile submissive elites that constantly comply , but part of the missing truth ( ( from it ) ) is that there are circles among the arab elites that have a better ability at reading changes occurring at home and abroad , and that reassess their position vis - a - vis the events , and we ought to give them , as they say , credit .
true , true
true , %pw , true
ok , dr. fawaz
in fact , in fact , the fact is that i would hope , i hope i am wrong , wrong mr. amr , this is not the question , we are trying to read the mood , the mood of the arabs , ( clears throat ) in this historic moment .
uh , in fact we haven 't answered the main question , have we hafez ?
yes
the main question is , are the regimes trying , are the arab regimes trying to . . . or are they or are they or are they trying to be really serious to begin a radical constitutional reform process ( yes ) in order in order to build an effective partnership with their civil societies ?
did they succeed ?
to only bend to the storm ?
um . . yes .
yes .
that is the ( ( question ) ) .
and your answer and your answer to it ?
my answer to it , really , is that we don 't have the tangible and critical facts so far , and i agree with mr. amr that certain elites , certain arab elites , you know , uh , that manage the arab affairs %pw , you know , they read the international mood and the popular mood , i mean the historic moment is important ,
are you telling me that international pressure was there before the bombings , uh , uh , that is , of september 11 september on the arab region ?
the american president said it himself ( clears throat ) that the united states used to %pw support the authoritarian regimes and uh , you know , they were trying in fact to help the authoritarian regimes to verify
dr. fawaz ,
yes .
thank you very much , uh , because time %pw is very limited ,
we are left with this very question that we posed , is the scene simply a bending or a point of no return with respect to the changes and with respect to what the arab audience can accept ?
and i add to it , dr. amr , there is one american researcher with the conservative right wing american enterprise who compared the american invasion of iraq %pw with the french invasion of egypt ,
uh , which means that it is a new beginning for this region and a change and an eye - opener for it to new things ( ( ) ) .
well , well , notwithstanding this this comparison , i think this is outside any scientifically and culturally acceptable context for discussions and historical comparisons , i think in the main question , mr. hafez , uh , is it a bending to the storm ? or is it a genuine desire ?
yes .
yes .
i think the fate of the process of change , the changes %pw that are ongoing now will be settled in the coming period .
it will be settled by a number of main players regardless of the intentions ,
we have civil societies that are putting pressure , elites that may or may not respond , regardless of their intentions ,
and an international environment pushing in the direction of change .
we have to provide more than the dynamic of the process of change itself , and not , be content with posing premature questions ,
is it an internal or external pressure ?
is it a bending to the storm or is it a latent desire ?
uh , there is movement , finally there is movement .
what do we say to washington ? keep the pressure or stop and let it be ?
i 'd say to them if you want to push for democratic changes , then do what you see as , uh , the right thing to do , but with calm and without declared , uh , banners
yes .
true
ok , dr. naguib , one last word from you before the end of the program .
yes , we welcome the american pressures that lead to genuine democracy in the region .
and here , really , i see that the administration has become a prisoner of its own propositions ,
so this is a good direction if it agrees , like dr. amr kindly said , with a domestic movement that has been demanding democratic change and , uh , openness since the eighties
in this regard , yes , this is much better than what took place in the iraqi case .
thank you very much , naguib alghadhban , amr hamzawy , and fawaz girgis from new york .
uh , of course , in the first segment we had with us the american assistant secretary of state discussing the annual report of the state department on human rights ,
i thank my guests in this episode and , uh , greetings from the program team in doha and here in the american capital
i am also asked to remind you at the end of the episode that the opinions appearing on the program from washington do not necessarily express the opinion of al-jazeera channel , uh if they did , %pw , did not express at all ( laughter ) the opinion of al-jazeera channel if i knew it , but they express the opinions of their owners and i am one of them ,
hafez almirazi .
[ ] ( sound of paper ) ( clears throat )
our honored viewers , welcome to today 's episode of the program more than one opinion , coming to you live on the air from london .
tunisia , during the rule of the late president bourguiba , hosted the arab league after the suspension of egypt following its signing of the peace treaty with israel
and it opened its doors to the palestine liberation organization after its eviction from lebanon following sharon 's invasion .
tunisia mixed the blood of its children with the blood of %pw the palestinians after israel 's air raid in 85 .
after the dismissal of bourguiba , israel assassinated on the soil of tunisia abu jihad and abu ayad .
tunisia now prepares itself to welcoming sharon to attend the world summit on the information society this coming november .
after the summit of sharm el - sheikh early last month , the foreign minister of israel declared that 10 arab countries , among them tunisia , were on the verge of establishing diplomatic relations with israel .
so was this declaration an israeli balloon for local consumption inside israel to allow the sharon 's plan for disengagement from gaza to pass ?
or was it raising the fate of relations with the arabs in light of the secret and open contacts and meetings between israeli and arab officials in western capitals and in the hallways of the united nations ?
so is it haphazard therefore to consider the invitation addressed by the tunisian president to sharon to attend the international conference on the information society as part of the preparation to normalize relations with israel through the diplomacy of the internet ?
or is the participation of israel at the conference as the tunisian foreign minister said is done in an international context and ends there with the conclusion of the summit ?
in spite of these clarifications , the debate heated up about the invitation of sharon to this summit .
the tunisian opposition demanded the cancellation of the visit , pledging that sharon will walk over our dead bodies to get to the conference .
criticisms by tunisians do not only include the invitation to sharon with his bloody history , but also the choice of tunisia to host a conference on strengthening the freedom of the media and the exchange of information in light of the restrictions imposed on these rights in tunisia , according to their claims .
after the return of the late arafat to gaza following the oslo agreement , some gulf and north african arab countries took the initiative to open commercial offices and contacts with the hebrew state .
but the al-aqsa intifada and the arab summit in 2000 froze the arab fever towards israel and those offices were closed in protest of the israeli practices against the palestinians .
so what has changed now ?
and will the return of normalization with israel , even through the internet summit or concluding a gulf business deal with sharon to buy the facilities in the settlements in gaza after the promised israeli withdrawal , be consistent with the decisions of the arab summit in cairo and amman to not proceed with any political or economic activity with israel ?
or are the arab summit decisions mere ink on paper , and the algiers summit this month will be the exception ? or a confirmation of normalization with israel under the pretext of surrounding it with peace ?
our honored viewers , with us today in london is mr. abd elbary atwan , editor - in - chief of the newspaper al-quds al-arabi , and the tunisian attorney mr. samir abdallah , a journalist and political commentator who has just arrived from tunisia .
and we welcome by satellite from the al-jazeera office in cairo mr. ali salem , the known egyptian playwright and journalist .
our honored viewers , i hope you will stay with us after this short break .
our honored viewers , welcome again to our program more than one opinion .
mr. samir abdallah , you just arrived from tunisia , praise be to god for your safety .
uh , the timing of the invitation to sharon , uh , the prime minister of israel , to attend the summit , the world summit on the information society weeks after the sharm el - sheikh summit , uh uh , well , it raises legitimate questions , uh , about the significance of this invitation , especially since , you know , the hands of this man are stained with palestinian and arab blood , a war criminal , as the mayor of london today said , ken livingstone , in the british newspaper the guardian
who also said that he should be in prison and not in in in in in the position of the head of government .
mr. sami , the rule , the norm , the , the known newspaper and you are the expert , you say that the news is sacred and the commentary free .
and i would like here , and i %pw just arrived from the capital tunis , that we put the viewers in tunisia and in the arab nation and in the world into the real context of the facts of what is going on now in tunisia .
the summit on the information society was held in response to a tunisian initiative that was proposed in %pw , 1998 , which is , mr. sami , 7 years before the events of september 11 that turned the world upside down before the greater middle east project , before bush , before all these events .
98
uh ok , ok , ok , ok .
therefore i say that this this this event , this event has nothing to do whatsoever with the current political conditions that are linked to the palestinian cause and to arab conditions .
then , then , you really want to say that this symposium is an international symposium .
in 2001 the united nations approved , the general assembly of the united nations %pw convened in 2001 and approved the tunisian proposal and suggested organizing a summit in a first phase , it met in geneva in 2003 and its second phase will meet in tunisia this coming november .
in tunisia , %pw , that is , you want it to be an international conference
ok .
therefore , this summit has no connection with the present political events that the arab nation is experiencing . i end with this one bit of information .
ok , ok , possible , for the first , for the first time ( ( i go into ) ) .
uh uh , the information was understood by the viewers , but , uh uh in order to put you in the picture , this program is not a shouting program . for the first time i participate in a program of intellectual conversation .
no , no ( ( this is not ) ) shouting , this is a matter of facts .
ok , my question , therefore therefore do i understand from this , do i understand from this , uh uh that , well , tunis , uh uh uh , i mean , has become new york the headquarters of the united nations ?
well , clearing itself of of of of of of its responsibility of its responsibility as a sovereign country , then then if it was a hosting country of this conference , then the country has become akin to a mailman delivering uh invitations , ( ( ) ) and overseeing the protocols , and offering security to sharon and and and his guests ?
no no no , %pw , my dear sir , tunisia has hosted arab summits . it hosted the 5 plus 5 summit that gathered the leaders of the mediterranean from both its northern and southern shores .
this is a summit that is convened under the sponsorship of the united nations . and tunisia %pw is an active member inside the united nations , and one of the founders of this organization .
uh , therefore i said , and since this meeting is organized by the united nations and under the direct sponsorship of the united nations , it is subject to a known international agreement , which is the vienna agreement .
some opposition members %pw , are deliberately , and they are jurists , are deliberately ignoring this legal fact .
the vienna agreement of 1976 , article 82 , regulates relationships between international conferences that are convened under the auspices of the united nations and the hosting countries .
% pw
% pw
the attendance by israel , the attendance by egypt , the attendance by president bush at this summit , the attendance by president jacques chirac for example , from france does not mean an approval by tunisia or a recognition by tunisia of that country to attend the conference .
ok , ok , a second question , a second question , ok , alright , ok , question .
therefore . . .
well , well it is superfluous to say and remind the viewers that tunisia hosted , uh , uh , the arab league after the conclusion uh of the camp david accord , peace between egypt and israel .
uh , tunisia hosted the palestine liberation organization headed by the late yasser arafat in 82 when he departed from from from from from , or was evicted from from from tripoli in lebanon . and sharon at that time had invaded invaded invaded lebanon .
so tunisia experienced the mixing of the blood of its people throught the israeli raids , 85 , the headquarters of the plo , the assassination of the late abu jihad who was in charge of the first intifada in 88 , also the assassination , uh , uh , of the second ranking man in fatah , abu , uh , abu abu uh salah khalaf , abu ayad .
yes .
i mean , ok , tunisia , when it accepted this invitation , didn 't it take %pw these things , these historical facts , into consideration and know that he will invite tunis to it ?
didn 't it take this into consideration ?
% pw , the issue has no connection with the person , uh , of the current israeli prime minister , whether he is sharon , or netanyahu , or even shimon peres .
international relations are governed by relations between countries where , regardless of %pw the governments that rule these countries .
tunisia has not announce normalization with israel .
tunisia did not announce the establishment of diplomatic relations with israel .
tunisia did not announce did not announce did not announce .
% pw , sorry ( ( ) ) 66 ( ( ) )
there are some who admitted . there are some who admitted . there are some opposition members who turned into fortune - tellers who can divine the secret intentions behind political decisions .
i am here not a political fortune - teller ,
ok .
ok , ok , uh , mr. samir , mr. samir , i
i want , i want to complete this thought .
uh , the subject subject of normalization , do not , normalization , this will come in the second part of the program
i have two guests before the news summary .
abd elbary atwan , what do you think of this invitation ?
well , first of all , mr. samir says that , uh , tunisia , uh , presented a long time ago ( ( ) )
since 98 .
98 .
you know , this , you know , that tunisia has intentions for hosting the israeli prime minister , regardless of who that prime minister is , you know , the intentions are concealed .
why didn 't tunisia host conferences such as this conference in which israelis participate for example during the eighties or the seventies or the sixties , if this is an international conference ?
so there are intentions by the tunisian government to host israeli officials under the umbrella of the united nations .
i want to ask a question . you know , if the united nations tomorrow requests the organization of a conference in tunisia about the dialogue between religions or %pw , about the dialogue between cultures , and it suggests the name of sheikh rashed al-ghannouchi to be a participant at that conference , will tunisia accept to host sheikh rashed al-ghannouchi ?
by god , it would have blasted the united nations , by god , and it would have canceled the conference , and said that this is an organization that does not represent
in fact , this , ( ( ) ) this , this uh , if you allow me , i mean this this point is very , uh , you know , important ,
% pw , uh , for example , a fact
if there were a conference on religions organized by the united nations , the united nations . we don 't want to %pw say about the arab summit that was postponed in tunisia . and and hamas and islamic jihad did not attend , as a reminder that hamas and islamic jihad in their capacity as %pw , but as palestinian members , so if if mr. al-ghannouchi , mr. rashed al-ghannouchi , leader of the an - nahda party , who uh , was arrested in tunisia , to an international conference , will tunisia allow the convening of such a conference ?
first , mr. sami , i am not an official spokesman to express the positions of the authorities in tunisia .
the authorities in tunisia have their representatives , have their positions , have their choices that they defend .
i am an attorney who has come from tunisia , %pw , i have my national convictions . i agree with national trends as presently established by the tunisian leadership .
i think that these examples will keep us off the substance of the issue .
there are parties who want to exploit the palestine question .
and if there is one arab country whose patriotic positions are beyond reproach , and this is what , and this is what was presented in the introduction which was kindly , a very good introduction , %pw , kindly presented by %pw mr. sami .
mr. samir , this is a procedural question , this is a procedural question , no , no , this is a procedural question .
no , no , we are not judging , god .
tunisia 's positions are constant with respect to the palestinian cause .
tunis , till today , hosts institutions affiliated %pw with the plo .
and i have abu lutuf , uh , faruq al-kaddoumi , currently fatah president , ok ,
uh uh uh , these are constant positions .
but let me continue , but let me continue , but %pw , i mean let me . . .
sorry , sorry , %pw so we do not leave the subject , either , but i mean tunisia has positions and other than its positions .
abd elbary atwan , allow me , i mean how , %pw , i mean do you want the , you know , the tunisians to be more palestinian than the palestinians ?
well , uh , the meeting of abu , uh , mazen , the current president of the authority , the second now , at , uh , the summit of aqabah and now the sharm el - sheikh summit , there always are palestinian - israeli contacts in secret and in public ,
in other words , what is forbidden , uh , allowed to you , is forbidden to others ?
no , well , uh , it is not an issue of allowed and forbidden . this issue , i mean , tunisia is a far away country . tunisia is not , you know , a front line country .
uh ,
uh
that is , we are now
are there still front line countries remaining ?
one moment please , one moment , one moment please , one moment please .
the past is past , may god have mercy on it , uh
well , we now want to pressure israel to the greatest extent possible , and mobilize %pw our arab brothers so they are of assistance to us .
i mean , i personally , and you know , i do not agree with abu mazen and i do not agree with his premises , and against the oslo agreements , and against all this trickery of peace .
but we expect our arab brothers , especially in the outlying areas that is , to say , " no , sharon , " and by god you %pw , as he said , as you kindly said , ken livingstone who is british is saying that this man practiced ethnic cleansing and his hands his hands are stained with blood and must be behind bars and not at the helm , uh , uh , that is , of a summit , at the helm of a country .
so we expect from the arab brothers to tell %pw the israelis , by god we will not normalize with you , we are free
and to tell the americans who are pressuring for normalization , by god we will wait , if there is progress and there is an implementation of the resolutions of international legitimacy
we . .
i mean , in this case , we will study the question , % pw
abd , abd elbary , we have moved to the topic of normalization which we will address in the second part of the program .
uh , ok .
but as the foreign minister of tunisia , mr. al-hermassi said that this is an international conference attended by israel , the summit is over , the information summit , the information society , and he goes home and it 's the end of the story , period .
the end of the story .
my brother , does the story not end ?
why should we exaggerate ?
i mean , isn 't it , well , well , isn 't it something honorable ? or isn 't it something honorable to convene , convene a summit ?
the story does not end , my brother , my brother , my brother , my brother , the story does not end , mister , listen to me , my brother , listen to me .
please allow me , isn 't it something honorable to convene an international summit , 190 countries in one arab country , over information ?
and , and ( ( ) )
what information my brother ? what information my brother , what information my brother ?
( ( ) ) my question , mister
look , we , we 're the ones who under the pretext of information , in normalization we want to do it .
and then , my god ! , i mean tunisia is the summit of the freedom of information in the arab world , for example , or in the world at large .
we all know our situation . all the arab countries are against information , against the freedom of information , against the computer , against the internet , %pw , %pw , %pw , %pw , confiscated sites .
there are people who were sentenced to 26 years in prison because %pw , %pw they used materials on the internet in tunisia itself . .
we , we %pw , aren 't amnesty international organization to investigate cases ,
but one moment , one moment .
but allow me to continue , allow me to continue , please .
% pw , perhaps perhaps we will talk about this in , uh , when we discuss the issue of the conference , its implications and its significance , and why . .
but sir , i have one word , one word , one word
i have a news summary .
three words , not more .
% pw , before the break
one word .
what , what ?
let everyone know , and the %pw , and the tunisian people knows it , and for president ben ali 's information , and they have complete confidence in president ben ali who is entrusted with the justice of the palestinian cause , and his positions on iraq and on the thirty - some aggression against iraq are known , %pw uh , tunisia is one of few arab countries
my brother , no one doubts
and president ben ali is one of the few arab presidents who did not send a single tunisian soldier to fight the iraqi people during the second gulf war in spite of the pressures that the united states exerted on all the arab regimes .
mister , mister , mister samir , mister samir , we
therefore , i think that tunisia has no need , has no need for a certificate of good behavior when it comes to its support of the palestinian cause .
neither ben ali , neither president ben ali , nor tunisia are in a position ( ( ) ) , allow me
ok , %pw , uh , listen to me . ok , no no , you said one word , you gave me a lecture
i want to continue , continue , relations are broken . . .
mr. ali salem , mr. ali salem , we have a news summary , i am sorry . i have , i told you that your answers should be short in the beginning of %pw uh , the first 20 minutes .
mr. ali salem in cairo , well , the uproar about the invitation to sharon to tunisia to attend an international conference under the auspices uh of the united nations , well , do you think that it is a contrived uproar , i mean in sharm el - sheikh , in tunisia , what difference is there really ?
no , this is an uproar that remains stored from , uh uh , %pw the old arab - israeli conflict .
uh , there is not one arab country at present that is in a state of war with israel .
and a country , either it is in a state of war with another country , or it is at peace .
tunisia is not at present in a state of war with israel .
and the so - called normalization , this , this is an invention . we are the ones who invented it in egypt , you know . the story of preventing normalization , confronting normalization , resisting normalization
peace means normal relations . nobody sits down with somebody else , agrees on peace and and and one of the provisions is that its relations with them is not normal .
so , we 've forgotten this issue .
and even %pw the tunisian opposition , what i understood from your words , mr. sami , they say the , the , the essence of the , uh , of the matter is not a story of bush , the essence is that , uh , uh , uh , do you argue with freedom ?
sharon , you mean sharon
uh , uh , uh , sharon .
do you argue with freedom and we do not have it ?
this is a totally different issue .
and the story about preventing him with our bodies , this too is from the residues of the old slogans .
the region is going through a completely new phase .
and and and tunisia
even though , mr. ali , mr. ali , mr. ali salem , even though , %pw , %pw , do not forget that the tunisians , you know , are against %pw the invitation to sharon
and and those who criticized this invitation and were put in jail , among them is attorney mohammad abuah , and two days earlier
but then , uh , in addition to the issue of , uh , uh , why that that that that the conference is held in a country where , those people claim , you know , that we find freedoms in it .
but the question , then , is the prevailing climate now after the sharm el - sheikh summit , uh , in which president mubarak met with sharon , and the return of the two ambassadors , the egyptian , the jordanian , to israel , well , these things encourage the other countries now to re - normalize with israel , those countries that , you know , had frozen their relations after the al-aqsa intifada and the cairo summit of 2000 .
by god , %pw , we should not fool ourselves , nobody 's has , %pw , frozen anything . and everyone has their relations with israel their own way .
um
that is , each one has its concealed relations with israel ,
do you have proof ? do you have proof ?
but it is clear that president
no , you have them on the television screens and in the news agencies .
yes
aren 't they proof ?
well , does this need proof , mr. sami ?
um , um .
uh , uh , %pw , %pw the tunisian %pw leadership has the right , all the right as a statesman to make decisions according to calculations that benefit his regime and his people . this is the story .
um .
um ,
% pw
people , no one is in a state of war with israel .
we should pay attention to that .
uh , ok .
as a result , everyone is expecting that there ought to be % pw
mr. ali , the fact is , fact is , fact is , whether these countries are in a state of war with israel or are not in a state of war ( cough ) , they signed peace agreements like egypt , and jordan , and mauritania in 99 .
but we will address in the second part to , of this program after the news summary , about whether we are on the way to normalizing relations with israel through this conference or through secret contacts that are ongoing since the intifada until now .
our honored viewers , i hope you will stay with us .
our honored viewers , peace be with you .
from mexico in ' 75 to copenhagen in ' 80 , to nairobi in ' 85 , to peking in ' 95 , to peking plus five in ' 2000 , the caravan of the united nations women 's conferences has stopped this time in new york under the title of peking plus ten .
so , i wonder , what happened between peking and peking plus ten ?
have the arab and islamic countries persisted in maintaining their reservations about the peking document that raised much controversy when it was published in ' 95 ?
or have they been influenced by international circumstances and pressures from outside forces about women 's rights ?
and what is behind the accusations leveled against the recommendations currently being drafted in new york that they do not take into consideration the cultural disparity and differences in civilizations , and that they are trying to propose a single cultural pattern for rights ?
and what are the positions of the arab delegations and family advocates on the attempts at enshrining concepts such as marriages of perverts , the right to safe abortion for adolescent girls , sexual freedom for women outside the context of marriage , and safe sex for young women and young men ?
and on the opposite side , is this document and similar documents about women totally without any positives ?
didn 't they seek to put forth rights for fighting illiteracy and poverty , and for guaranteeing a role for women in the process of development ?
and is there a coordination between arab countries , the vatican and the united states in their positions rejecting the concept of safe abortion for adolescent girls ?
to talk about the activities of the peking plus ten conference , whose proceedings are currently going on in new york , we welcome in our studios in doha from iraq dr. alia alkurdi , and from lebanon mrs. azza alhurr mroueh , general coordinator of the national gathering for the elimination of discrimination against women .
and we also welcome in our studios in new york mrs. maha abu - dayyeh shammas , director of the women 's center for counseling , as she is participating in the proceedings of the conference there .
welcome to all of you guests on this episode of for women only .
our honored viewers , you too can participate in this dialogue in all its aspects and dimensions by contacting us either by telephone at the number 974 , which is the code for qatar , 4888873 , and by fax at the number 9744890865 .
we also await your participation on the internet at the following address , at our site on the home page , www . aljazeera . net .
we welcome the opinions and comments of everyone and as usual from both genders .
and to begin with , and to take the viewer to the atmosphere of the new york conference and the debates underway there about the issues of disagreement , our colleague abd alrahim fuqara has prepared the following report from there .
to begin with , we continue together .
the meetings of the tenth anniversary of the beijing declaration hosted by the united nations headquarters in new york was not free of controversy , and even paradoxes .
the most flagrant manifestations of that controversy was represented in an american proposal to prevent considering abortion as a human right .
washington was forced to withdraw its proposal in the end after it collided with a large scale wall of rejection .
which did not prevent washington from asserting that it has accomplished its objectives .
we did not obstruct in any way the progress of these sessions .
and we succeeded in achieving our objectives that we consider to be very important for us .
and we clarified that these meetings did not create new human rights such as abortion .
many official and non - official parties , including islamic organizations , declared their support for the american position rejecting abortion .
abortion , first is %pw %pw , uh , instead of going and aborting the girl , we go to find fundamental solutions that prevent %pw uh , to begin with , the girl or the woman from getting pregnant by illegitimate means .
so we stop wars , and %pw , %pw we treat the issues with education about abstinence and we treat , uh , the issues %pw , uh , social solutions that prevent rape etc .
some of these organizations also demand an explanation of the notion of equality between man and woman as stipulated by the beijing declaration in a manner that respects the specificities of each culture .
and while these organizations argue that assigning the task of spending on the family to the man is compassionate to the woman and not discriminatory against her , other parties see that the division of labor in this fashion is not only degrading of the woman 's standing but is also harmful to the well - being of society at large .
all indicators published by the international bank and academic institutions confirm that when the woman is educated and has an income , this has benefits not just for the woman but for the family and its environment .
and regardless of the disagreements that are raised in these meetings , there is consensus among all the women participants that there is still a long way to go for the woman , even though the number of women ministers , judges , and others has increased around the world since the adoption of the beijing declaration ten years ago .
some non - governmental organizations accuse the governments of negligence in implementing the beijing declaration .
yet , several governments , led by the american government argue that they have not spared an effort to improve the conditions of women , not only on its own soil but also in other regions of the world .
and the american government is currently seeking to convince the rest of the countries to ban the sex trade , which raises fears that this trade might be pushed underground and exacerbate aids , the disease of loss of immunity , around the world .

al-jazeera , at the united nations .
so , uh , peking plus ten and the activities of the conference in new york , we will find out what is going on there , and some points of disagreement and agreement in this episode , but after the break .
welcome again , uh .
professor azza , i start this episode with you .
mexico ' 75 , copenhagen ' 80 , nairobi ' 85 , peking ' 95 , peking plus five , all these conferences , to begin with just to inform the viewer , what are these names and dates ? and how did these conferences start ?
extremely briefly .
uh , first , uh , i want to tell you that tonight is the night , uh , the eve of international woman 's day .
correct .
and on this occasion , yes , i would like to congratulate you . we say , " may each year find you well , a thousand greetings to y ' all . "
welcome .
because , i want , i 'm correcting , a salute because international woman 's day is not a feast , rather it is a station of struggle that was consecrated by the sweat and blood of women workers , uh , who undertook a movement demanding the rights of humanity , for the rights of humanity , and this movement was repressed and martyrs fell among them %pw , workers in new york , 1,057 ,
correct .
and it was established at a world conference in 1910 until the world democratic women 's union was founded in ' 45
and , uh , they adopted an international woman 's day and it is a milestone of struggle . this is a salute , uh , to y ' all , to dr. alia
and we in turn salute you on this day , thank you .
for the qatari woman , for %pw the iraqi woman , uh , for the palestinian woman , i 'm sayin ' the iraqi woman struggling for her country , and the palestinian woman , and the arab woman in general , and for the women , to the women all over the world , and uh , uh , uh , uh a salute as well to the lebanese woman . precisely
very nice , what are these names ? yes , what are the names and dates that we mentioned at the beginning of this episode ? how did these conferences start ?
uh , i started here to say that %pw , this day wasn 't decided by the united nations .
uh , in ' 67 the international declaration was issued , uh , uh , %pw a declaration to eradicate discrimination against women , a declaration but not an agreement
and in ' 75 , uh , it was decided , uh , the year , uh , the year , the year 1975 , international woman 's year .
and the woman 's decade from ' 75 to ' 85 , it was called the woman 's decade throughout ten years .
ten years .
and march 8 was decided as international woman 's day and it became international woman 's day since then .
nice , correct .
uh , %pw , the mexico , uh , conference , in fact the first conference in mexico , uh , was the first international woman 's conference in ' 75 under the slogan , " equality , development , peace . "
yeah .
uh , really the world gathered from various , in both its official and civil sectors , and there were many democratic organizations in it from %pw , various parts of the world ,
yeah .
and it issued recommendations we worked on , and we armed ourselves with them and worked on them until ' 80
in ' 80 , there was no conference . ' 80 was half the woman 's decade .
yeah .
i mean , yes , it it it was set in place from mexico
it was held every ten years , and at every middle of the period there was a small conference
recommendations were issued , weren 't they ? resolutions were issued .
um , yes .
an evaluation milestone was put in place to know where we got to ? what have we done ?
yeah , it may , uh ? what did we accomplish ? what were the factors %pw , uh and the obstacles , uh , that stood in our way ? and how can we go on ?
uh , the third conference in nairobi in 85 was truly very important because it adopted the forward - looking strategies to lift women through the year 2000 .
i mean , it set . yes , it set these strategies until the year 2000 .
15 years .
and i , it is my opinion that if , now there 's no time , you know , because we need to speak fast ,
but when these aspirations are examined , we see that they are very important and remain %pw , effective and constitute a foundation .
of course , taking into consideration advances and new developments .
it was based on them .
yeah , until the fourth , uh , international woman 's conference in peking came in ' 95 .
peking ' 95 .
or beijing as they call it , uh .
in fact , beijing is how it is said in the language of %pw . .
we say it peking .
this point , uh , may , uh , if this constitutes a turning point and a fundamental turning point .
first , uh , it was formed , i mean , the united nations proceeded on the eve of the fourth international conference to request that all %pw , uh , the countries form national women 's committees , for women 's affairs .
and these national committees included the official and the civil sectors .
so this is the first point .
the second point , uh , it proposed central issues , very important issues , issues we used to propose previously , but also issues that were proposed anew .
i mean it was , uh , of the new ones for example
well , do you want me to enumerate them ?
issues , quickly , quickly , it laid out women and poverty , education and instruction ,
%pw , uh , %pw , briefly , please two or three points only .
health , women and conflicts ( ( ) ) no , those wereproposed , but they were not proposed before .
these points were not proposed previously ?
which ones are they ?
and they are very important , the quota ,
the right to a share , the quota , violence against women .
30 % .
i , in my opinion , it had , uh , fundamental stuff .
and women in decision - making positions and her rights , i mean , this story . .
um .
this was what was newly proposed in peking ' 95 , um .
and uh , uh , yes , a new and a new proposal that we armed ourselves with .
we , in our work , through our struggle , we armed ourselves with it , of course on the sidelines ,
nice , ok , so from ' 95 . .
on the sidelines of the conference , some issues were proposed that were controversial , such as the right to abortion for example .
controversial , very nice . from peking ' 95 , to peking plus five in 2000 , now peking plus ten in new york , these conferences over the years always included sharp disagreements and it is known , uh uh uh as part of these conferences and these disagreements interacted in all directions .
maybe these disagreements were prevalent between the participating delegations , whether , you know , official or those representing organizations and institutions of civil society on one side , and uh , uh , the representatives of governments and countries on the other side .
so , also to begin with , why ? what are the reasons for these differences ? in points , in brief , because we will go into , uh , their details in the course of this episode .
what are the points of disagreement ?
uh , in the name of god most gracious and merciful , to begin with i thank you for being a ( ( good ) ) hostess .
before you answer me , i , uh , want to apologize to you . you are a researcher in the field of gender and women , and your advanced studies for the masters and the doctorate degrees were in this field , and our apologies for not mentioning this in the introduction . please go ahead , dr .
uh , so the most important main issues for which there was disagreement over with in the peking document , the first was sexual relations and all that is associated with it , either within the context of marriage , or outside the context of marriage , and all that is associated with those relations : abortion , reproductive health as a concept and as awareness at the level of awareness and at the level of services .
uh .
second of all , %pw , %pw , the second issue over which there is disagreement , the family , the family as a concept , the family as patterns , the family as roles and functions .
uh .
third issue , the empowerment of women and women 's inheritance , and considering women 's inheritance as a point of entry to the empowerment of women .
uh .
uh .
and uh , addressing the empowerment of women as one of the gateways , a gateway to eradicating poverty in human societies .
so these three issues were the subject of disagreements because , as a result of the bias of the document to one specific socio - cultural pattern at the expense of other social and cultural patterns that exist inside human societies .
meaning
meaning ? briefly
meaning its bias towards the western socio - cultural pattern ,
uh , um .
at the expense of socio - cultural diversity inside non - western societies .
yes .
arab and islamic .
arab and islamic , yes .
first thing .
second thing , it adopted western logic , %pw , as a way of thinking and a philosophy in addressing issues , without taking into consideration the logic of islamic and arab societies in addressing the same issues , and the reality of these societies and how to deal with these societies if the goal is to improve the status of women , and change her conditions for the better .
and the third important issue is the issue of addressing the woman herself , reducing the woman to the context of the individual human being , whereas the woman for us is in the context of the family , in the context of the individual human being plus the context of the family plus the context of society .
to deal with the woman as an individual , that is to emphasize individualism with respect to the woman or the man .
as an individual , as a human being , yes .
and these are the most important foundations , of uh , the - foundations of western thought and philosophy .
uh .
and this contradicts the reality of our societies , as a reality .
we will discuss these points , uh , in detail during this episode .
i go to you , mrs. maha , in new york , in our studios in new york .
you are now a participant in the proceedings of this conference and through you we will try to take a look at what is going on .
we learned at the beginning that there was a coalition of islamic organizations among the group of delegations and institutions participating in this peking plus ten conference .
what are the most important points that were debated at this conference ?
%pw , uh , right , before i get into that subject , i 'd like to suggest the idea that we shouldn 't always focus on the issues of disagreement .
the question posed : why %pw the united states still refuses to %pw sign on the sidaw convention ?
yeah .
the fundamental issues on which the united states , on which it doesn 't %pw , doesn 't want to commit itself to , they have to do with economic rights , which have to do with %pw , with the issues of poverty , which have to do with uh the issues %pw , uh , %pw the centers of power , the representation of women in %pw in %pw uh the decision - making centers .
yes .
the issues that are %pw , that %pw , that are always raised really exist on the american arena but which provoke %pw %pw the societies , of course , like our societies in the arab world .
and these put us in a position that . .
ok , what are these issues mrs. maha ?
we , the positive issues in this document , as we began in this episode , we will dwell on them so that % pw
yeah , i . .
we always stay in the context %pw , uh , uh , of the debate and the context %pw of criticism .
but now , you are in new york and and a participant at this conference , what are the points of disagreement that , you know , about which there is , %pw , %pw disagreement and debate this year ?
but that is it %pw , this is why i said , because the united states tried to steal the attention and focus it on the issues that are not the fundamental ones for women in the world %pw , throughout the world .
and these are the issues of poverty , resolving the issues of armed conflict , uh the issues %pw uh , of political representation . and they tried to focus and put the spotlights on the issues of abortion .
and for women , the issue of abortion is settled %pw , yeah , almost across the world .
abortion is only %pw for the protection of women if there is a specific health situation .
and not %pw , uh , and there is no demand for open abortion .
and here , the united states tried to focus on this issue and bring in issues instead , uh , new issues into the international agreements instead of focusing on how can we uh , %pw , implement what has been agreed upon .
and here this began %pw uh the conflict between the united states %pw uh and the countries of the world and which took one week of wasted time .
yeah .
uh , %pw , of precious time , uh , for the , uh , people who all came to new york .
yes .
uh , and also of course , %pw the civil society institutions , they all had , uh , demands that were very clear ,
such that instead of sitting and finding uh , new agreements , let us consolidate what was not agreed , what was agreed on in beijing , and beijing plus five , and now beijing plus ten .
and in it there was a clear demand from uh , %pw , the societies %pw , %pw uh the society %pw the representatives of civil societies , that finding mechanisms %pw , uh , %pw to implement the united nations resolutions
perhaps this point specifically , mrs. maha , is
new things should not have been raised .
this conference should be blamed for it and also we will discuss in it %pw , that there is a sidelining of the disagreements points and always pressure in the direction of , uh , uh , implementation and the procedures and how %pw %pw countries should be pressured . anyway , we will open this file .
i go to you , mrs. azza .
points raised now by dr. alia . the first was not deferring to the cultural difference between societies ,
what this document and what followed it should be criticized for was its complete neglect , as you kindly said , of cultural differences , and imposing one cultural pattern to rights without consideration for the particularity , the particularity of societies , especially the islamic ones among them .
the fact is , i in my opinion , uh , what %pw dr. alia proposed and what professor maha proposed
mrs. maha .
i mean , uh , two of them , one of them should speak .
because i , before we went on the air , uh , professor , i told you that we do not consider only , uh , %pw the disagreements , or differences of opinion .
let us see what the other stuff is , what are the second fundamental and %pw positive issues in order to
we will pass over them , but don 't we stop and look at the disagreements ? i mean the disagreements that are underway now
i , yes , yes , this
at the conference . we always say let us not stop and look at the disagreements .
we will look at the points of convergence , uh , i promise you this .
this is what i proposed , what was proposed by %pw , uh , by the two sisters ,
what was proposed by the two sisters , this is something we have gotten used to and have become used to .
uh , there is a saying , " divide and conquer . "
so let us , as much as we can , %pw discard issues that may cause disagreements %pw in order to move away from fundamental issues . i have fundamental issues ,
you are discarding issues that may cause %pw disagreements , and are moving away from the fundamental issues .
not them . no , no , %pw , no , who is saying they ? i 'm saying somethin ' else .
in general , the other , the other always , the other .
i am saying when %pw , like maha is saying , sister maha .
when i want to put forward the issue , uh , of abortion , where is %pw this women 's movement , or the associations that are making the demand ?
this is not a demand . i want human rights for women .
i want , uh , uh , uh to eliminate discrimination against women .
i want to eliminate injustice , practices , i want to amend laws . i don 't want , i don 't want , uh uh
well , let us make an exception of abortion , and we will also talk about abortion , but it is , if it is turned into a binding provision
we can address other issues .
if it is turned into a binding provision , countries will be bound by it %pw and it becomes a problem for the arab world .
it will not be turned into a binding provision . shall i tell you why ? because it is not , there is no consensus on it , there is no agreement on it .
how ?
because , as alia said , there are differences in %pw cultures .
i . .
all the disagreement until there is a consensus on it .
no , %pw , no , there won 't be a consensus on it . and i am sure of this story . there won 't be a consensus on it .
% pw , i mean , let us not hold on to this story because i ,
there may be a consensus on this in societies that have specific customs , traditions and culture that follow that approach .
we do not %pw , we keep , you know , matters , uh , uh , in their essence , uh , i mean not , the situation is different , but i
good , if they were not looking for a consensus then , why , why were they looking to merge sidaw into the document ? why were they looking to merge , uh , sidaw , which most countries signed , into the document ? %pw , and removing reservations off sidaw ?
sidaw , by the way , by the way
for your information , uh , is an agreement , how many agreements and resolutions have come out of the united nations ?
i personally , i see that the sidaw agreement is a superior agreement that preserves the human rights of women .
in spite of all the reservations and in spite of all the serious criticisms against sidaw ?
and we must we must work to implement what the countries did not have reservations against , and to remove the reservations on this agreement .
over fundamental provisions , such as article 9 - paragraph 2
very nice , we must work to remove those reservations
uh , and the sidaw agreement , and it is not our subject really , but its merger into the peking document
and implementation
is what dumbfounded it on this issue .
it is the best document in the world .
it is rather an issue of role distribution .
meaning ?
conferences do focus on what was accomplished
and on the necessary measures to follow in implementing what was not implemented .
and the institutions of civil society put pressure to remove the reservations so that we import what we did not import from the western cultural pattern .
and until , and uh , and until and until it is established with us that there is a socio - cultural pattern that is dominant .
until it is forced , is that what you are trying to say ?
good , yes .
and all that is related to our culture and to our social systems go on the witness stand of the accused .
um .
on the witness stand of the accused , keep that thought and i will be back with you , our honored viewers , after a short break that includes a summary of the major and latest %pw news .
greetings honored viewers
has the alleged lebanese independence uprising gone with the wind after the million - man uprising that went out today in support of syria and the recusant national forces of foreign interference ?
has the alleged cedar revolution evaporated ?
one wonders .
whoever calls it the cedar or the independence uprising suffers either from a mental defect or is naive !
a lebanese writer states .
where have the uprisers of former days disappeared to ?
have the drummers for the lebanese youth demonstrations thought of the forces that stood behind the alleged georgian , ukrainian , and serb revolutions ?
have the uprisers been more than chessmen in the hands of dominant international forces ?
hasn 't the western press confirmed that the alleged popular uprisings are nothing more than prefabricated revolutions , paid for and arranged in the lobbies of the american intelligence or embassies ?
when has america patronized other nations ' issues ?
one wonders
if americans respected people 's inclinations , they would have responded to the demonstrations of millions of people in the heart of western capitals , who condemned its invasion of iraq .
what is this hypocrisy ?
someone else may wonders .
how then can we believe in the american support of the georgian , ukranian and lebanese demonstrations ?
does america want to spread freedom in the world and encourage uprisers ?
or does it use the hopes of those who dream of freedom to achieve its own goals in parts of world ?
why do those who applaud the alleged cedar uprising try to forget the exposed american conspiracy to overthrow venezuelian president chavez , despite the fact that millions of his people cheer his name ?
shouldn 't the arab population question a thousand times over any popular movement that america and france bless - - just as the lebanese people did today ?
one wonders . . .
especially , when we learn that some of the american and french officials were in lebanon when the previous demonstrations occurred .
isn 't it appropriate to question how , for instance , walid jumblatt , who is known for being adept in moving and influencing nations to serve the interest of the ascendant forces , how he was greeted in france and the vatican a few weeks ago ?
one wonders .
but , on the other hand , why don 't we say that the arab people have entered the " live nations ' club " after the beirut spring ?
shouldn 't everyone follow the lebanese example and take advantage of this historical opportunity to attain freedom and democracy ?
doesn 't the example of lebanon and egypt these days serve as a model for the possibilities for the future , that tonight won 't be just the same as last night ?
isn 't the ukraine to be thanked for the spreading of the colored revolutions ?
don 't the winds of change in the middle east , from the purple finger revolution in iraq to the cedar revolution in lebanon , carry the 1989 eastern european aura which dislodged the berlin wall and broke the peoples ' shackles ?
" when the arab spring blooms in beirut , it announces the time of roses in the rest of the arab capitals " , another says .
what is wrong about the intersection of the arab peoples ' blasts and the american calls for democracy in the region and and for freeing it of its dictatorial heritage ?
do we reject freedom solely because america is calling for it ?
these are questions i ask on the air to the baath leader ahmad al najdawi and to the iraqi politician and writer , mohammed al mousawy .
we 'll start the discussion after the break .
welcome once again honored viewers . we are with you live on our program the opposite direction . you can vote on the topic of today 's program .
will the lebanese uprising be the start of an age of public uprisings in the arab world ?
uh , the results as of now are 44.9 don 't think that it will be uh an age uh the start of an age of uprisings .
or , excuse me , the ones that think it will are 44 - - 55.1 don 't think it will .
you can vote uh from inside the country of qatar at phone number 9001000 , and from all parts of the world at 009749001900 .
the results are diverse - - .
64 yes , 36 no .
mr. mousawy , in the beginning , i mean a few weeks ago or i mean , a few days ago , the fact of the matter , the student uprising uh in uh lebanon provoked a lot of curiosity in the arab world . they believed that it was , i mean , it was a symbol of liberation , a symbol of freedom , and a symbol of democracy , beirit 's spring , the cedar revolution , independence , and all these descriptions we 've heard from the press .
today a totally adverse uprising of millions has emerged .
in this situation , i mean some have begun to wonder . . .
does this revolution today negate what has preceded it , especially that it was i mean truly and deservedly an uprising of millions , as the lebanese say .
uh in the name of god , the compassionate , the merciful .
" as for the scum , it vanishes as jetsam , and what profits men abides in the earth . "
true are the words of god , the great and exalted .
uh i don 't . . . don 't find that there is any contradiction between the two uprisings , if the saying is true .
i think what we saw today is uh the first drop of rain uh and it is the completion of the uprising , the the the the cedar uprising , the outstanding student uprising , that uh truly made us regain hope that the arab peoples are alive , even after attempts to put these people to sleep were made by the dictatorial regimes and the traditional classical parties .
the arab people proved in iraq and in lebanon and will prove , if god is willing , after a few days in syria and eygpt , that they are alive , people that have started to take initiative .
right here , i would like to say that the uprising , what you called the - the - uprising of today which happened today is that the lebanese street , the arab street in lebanon uh is back again , and has also taken hold of uh uh the reins of important matters , meaning they have taken the initiative .
days of initiatives , the days of uh the past were in the hands of the dictatorial regimes , in the hands of parties uh - reserved for the dictatorial regimes , in the hands of the nationalists , the baathists and the others , those who allowed themselves to be tools of oppression in the hand of the the regimes . even more , they became wipers " %pw " - shoe wipers for the dictatorial regimes , shoe wipers for despots , these who filled the " %pw " arab streets for the past 50 years with slogans , ravings , resounding speeches and words uh - a multitude of words , which weren 't successful in finding solutions .
what happened today in this uprising , is an extension of the uh cedar revolution , an extension of the lebanese people 's uprising , which uh proved , through it that they are a living nation just like the rest of the arab nation .
just a minute .
how is it an extension ? i mean .
i mean , talk rationally , i mean " %pw " , you know the saying , i don 't need to finish .
i mean , how is this an extension ?
doctor faysal , allow me ,
this uprising , just a minute , a minute , this uprising came as a counteraction to the alleged cedar revolution , the independence revolution . there are some who say it totally negated it , abolished it completely . the previous demonstrators disappeared in shame . some fled to europe , to what is there . if you take into consideration the statements of those whose voices used to be very loud in the past weeks , they all disappeared and started i mean fearing for their lives .
this is the real demonstration , the demonstration to hold on to national rights and not scream from from for . . . i mean . . . granting wishes to those coming across the border .
" %pw " " %pw " " %pw " irrespective of , irrespective of the favor they did , irrespective of the political alignments and the political agenda that stands behind this demonstration today , the demonstration of millions , is not uh uh the uh uh cedar demonstration because the demonstration was of millions in the whole sense of the word . irrespective of the political motives that stand behind this " %pw " demonstration , the lebanese people proved , once again , that they are people who take initiative .
when i said it is an extension %pw of the cedar uprising , i mean that the people in lebanon are the ones who have taken the initiative .
all that there is here is differences of opinion .
they are a group who are in favor of the international resolution , in favor of the international factor represented by resolution 1559 . there are other groups who are against this resolution .
this is a political movement . what this means is that the lebanese people , the arab people , have started to act .
again " %pw " emerge .
of course , by the way , these masses of people that we saw today , are the same masses who paid their last respects to the martyr , al hariri . they are the same masses who stood in martyrs ' square and demonstrated . they are the same martyrs , the masses who continue uh uh their political movement .
what is important is that the arab street , just as it moved in iraq through the purple finger revolution , challenged terrorism , challenged the baathists , the nationalists , the islamists , the tyrants , and the reactionaries , they all challenged the terrorist regimes . i would say that the arab street in lebanon has started to take the initiative , whether the initiative was with resolution 1559 , or the initiative was against resolution 1559 .
the initiative is the basis .
the arab peoples were put to sleep by the intelligence apparatuses that we saw in lebanon .
uh and the baath party organization , the nationalist organizations , and other organizations which uh allowed themselves to lose their noble party mission to lead the masses to " %pw " - to to to establish a liberal democratic system ,
allowed themselves to become a tool in the hands of who ?
in the hands of the dictatorial regimes , until the party leadership of these parties became , as i 've said previously , wipers of the dictatorial shoes .
uh very good . did you hear this talk mr. najdawy ?
i mean , there are some who say , i mean , we have heard the writings which say that the iraqi sun shines over lebanon , and as we have heard our brother say the alleged %pw %pw beirut or lebanese uprising will extend to many arab capitals ,
god willing , very soon .
first of all , truly , i thank al jazeera for this pulpit that always presents the intellectuals in our arab world , that leads the masses %pw with purposeful debates and not the way the brother is talking about it .
our brother , his talk , it 's all attack , it is all degeneration .
i mean , we are people whose thoughts are simply degenerated .
i think that this degeneration in the level of this debate and conversation deserves to be condemned by any citizen , whether from iraq , jordan , lebanon , or from anywhere .
ok , uh
beautiful .
the other matter that i would like to talk about in the beginning is that " %pw " today is march eighth .
and this day is historical in the history of the arab nation , not only because it is the remembrance of the great arab revolution , and also not uh because it is merely a day of the year or a day of a month , but because it is also a dear remembrance in all arab hearts , the remembrance of the march eighth revolution .
on this occasion , i give my congratulations and greetings to our arab people in syria who are now bearing up under all this , this american arrogance .
and uh i also congratulate the young syrian leadership represented by president bashar al assad , who was able , in the midst of these mines , minefields , to take a balanced position that undercuts a lot of conspiracies and conspirators against lebanon and syria .
the reaction in lebanon today and uh and using shaikh hassan nasrullah 's words , was a response that was sufficient to silence , silence all the slanderers of the revolutionary movement , the arab movement , despite all the difficulties , despite all the conspiracies , despite . . . despite the incitement and provocation against our people in syria , and our people in lebanon .
the saying that this sun shines now from iraq on " %pw " on uh uh " %pw " the iraqi sun is barely shining over iraq ; and it is not shining over iraq because of the american invasion and occupation and the american boots that the brother is talking about , the boots and shoes , the american shoes that are stepping on the necks of our people in iraq .
if the brother is talking about the people 's initiative , let him " %pw " let him address his group without mentioning " %pw " the parties . let him address his group so as to give freedom to the iraqi people , freedom to the people of falluja , freedom to the people of al-rumadi , to the people of mosul , give freedom to these people so they can express themselves .
this talk and " %pw " the talk about initiatives , the lebanese people . . . the lebanese people have been initiators all their lives . they do not need anyone to incite them as the brother was saying .
the lebanese people have been initiators all their lives . they are the cradle of civilization , the phoenician civilization , the arab civilization in lebanon gave the first writing in the history of the " %pw " " %pw " " %pw " " %pw " uh region , in the history of " %pw " " %pw " the arab nation .
beautiful , beautiful
this , sir , is in regards to the principle . we are with the uprisings .
in principle , i , at least , would say , using my own words , that i am in sympathy with the uprisings of the people , the students , and the general public . i am with these uprisings if they are in harmony and in accordance with the aspirations of the masses of the arab people , and not like the ukrainian way , or the georgian way . or say something else , because they are planning , in south . . . in . . . in south america they are planning . . .
or the serbian ?
in chile , they had done ( ( the before ) ) also something .
these " %pw " these . . . what they call uprisings . . .
they are really buying these people off . some are driven by good intentions , i am not accusing anybody , some are driven by good intentions ;
others are also deceived , led astray , or are given the run around .
and . . . and some , and then came " %pw " , uh the case of the killing of " %pw " the martyr , hariri , to polarize many people from the point of . . . no " %pw " i mean empathizing with this man 's case , the lebanese case , represented in " %pw " " %pw " " %pw " some others , no .
some lebanese leaders , i accuse some lebanese leaders , who go for , and participate in , make common cause with , and agree with the plans uh " %pw " " %pw " of the american administration .
because of that , we see that they sent them uh the field commander , as hassan nasrullah called him satterfield , satterfield .
" %pw "
pertaining to the field , as hassan nasrullah called him , satterfield . do you mean the american deputy secretary of state ?
disappointingly , president jacques chirac has fallen into the trap because of his love for lebanon , as sheikh hassan nasrullah , said .
but in reality it remains the imperialist dreams .
with a lot of sorrow , we still remember up till now uh the french practices , whether in algeria , or in any other arab country , and even in the suez war ; " %pw " the war of ' 56 was not . . . " %pw " we still have not forgotten but we ignored a lot and we said that . . . uh %pw these french practices were from other parties . " %pw " we were silent . . . and we were silent about all that happened in - from from france in " %pw " in the past two years .
ok , what
but that president chirac would bullheadedly visit lebanon behind the backs of the lebanon 's official leaders , and would not meet with any of them , i think this is nothing more than a colonial mentality , and a resurrection of imperialist dreams .
uh i have too high an opinion of president chirac to suspect him of of of falling into this dilemma . . .
ok .
very beautiful . did you hear this talk sir , uh , did you hear this talk ? there is , i mean , the heart of the matter is , i have concluded more than once , i mean , we shouldn 't drift after these " %pw " " %pw " claims . i mean " %pw " the professor is speaking about more than than than a demonstration . it seems like all of these demonstrations , were not driven by good intentions . there was , i mean , foreign greed , foreign hands directing them for their own interest , and they had nothing to do with the people .
i mean , if you take france , and this was published on on on a lot of of of sites . . . the french . . . the whole matter is related to syrian oil contracts .
there were some contract proposals for syrian oil and france did not get its share of these proposals , so they started to talk about freedom and democracy in the middle east .
french . . . business . . . but at the end of the day it is all a commercial matter and . . .
how would you respond ?
uh doctor , first allow me to thank you personally , doctor faysal alqassem , for bringing the professor and me together .
the gentleman is , i mean , my father 's age and i respect him and admire him . but he is from a political generation that got addicted to slogans .
%pw and what he has allowed , with all due respect " %pw "
no no no brother , no slogans . . .
do not interrupt me . i did not interrupt you . do not interrupt me . conversations are not carried on this way , i . . . ( ( ) ) this is my time .
( ( ) ) this is not true , no , no you are the one who started the attacking .
just a minute , please sir , just a minute , please , please , please .
doctor faysal , he took my time from me . i do not want him to interrupt me . anyway . . .
first of all , what he is offering is empty slogans , i mean , we . . . i was put off by it . . .
i mean , we heard this talk 50 years ago , mere slogans , empty , without any content , mere deception , and uh uh " %pw " um anesthesia for the arab people .
so he is talking about the memory of an arab revolution , the revolution of the march uprising .
the man is still a captive of the past . %pw the man still does not have , does not have the courage to say that he has become - - %pw , not him personally , but the ideas he holds - - have become crippled . they are ideas whose time has passed , whose time is up . why is it over ? i mean expire " %pw "
you mean the sell by the date %pw .
the man %pw exactly , the man is still holding on to the slogan of the great arab revolution , uh the eighth of february , the ninth of september . then %pw his talk is completely untruthful talk .
brother , without the great arab revolution , iraq would not be a state . sykes - picot made it a state .
just a minute , just a minute , just a minute , go ahead , sir , please , just a minute , just a minute , just a minute . . .
and i will say it to his face .
please , i 'm asking him to take back his words , or i , i will respond with what is uh uh even more debased than what he has said .
just a minute , just a minute , just a minute folks . cease these words . in the name of god ( ( ) ) let us abide , let us abid by the rules of the debate .
to respect , to respect this program , no , liar , i will not allow you to talk
i , %pw sir . . . i mean your ideas ( ( ) ) ideas . . .
you lie and slander your nation , you !
don 't . don 't interrupt me , ( ( ) ) sir !
allow me .
just a minute .
he talked , the gentleman talked %pw he said something . i 'll prove to you that what what uh what you said to him , the gentleman said something , that he supported the arab uprisings if those uprisings what , guarantee the interests of the arab peoples ?
the gentleman sitting in front of you stood against the uprising of the iraqi people in 1991 .
i will give you a chance , as much as you want , but , but , folks , but time is running out on us , after the news briefing from the news room . goodbye .
no , it is impossible , not on this basis .
but it is also because of uh , i mean , an underlying internal weakness in the arab system , that %pw uh is not limited to women and their abuse . but %pw uh uh it extends to the social system and internal social justice .
when we say that there is abuse against society , this includes everybody .
and when abuse is compounded - - invasion , for instance - - a system uh whether controlling , dominant , inclusive , exclusive , or one that depends on %pw %pw uh the notion uh uh i mean , %pw of possession %pw uh the notion of public service . this means that the whole nation suffers a loss of justice , freedom , and rights .
and when there is this loss , as uh zaynab has mentioned , women suffer directly . they suffer from violence , from %pw absence of social justice , from negative discrimination , etc . it all affects women . consequently , %pw %pw the arab countries and their regimes have not perceived the importance of the role of women as an indicator , as the standard of uh the advancement of society or as the standard of the success of a system in handling social issues .
the first to suffer are women , considering they are weaker , yes ,
but , but , uh %pw zaynab %pw you say uh uh - - i hope that i am not being unfair to you - - you are the only one i am calling by your name %pw by your first name , zaynab , without using family names , uh uh .
no , not at all . it 's okay . everything without family names .
%pw uh it is uh it is %pw %pw the opposition and the religious groups attract women %pw foreign powers attract women , the government does nothing .
some fear quite the opposite - - that the government also covets the large existing governmental women 's organizations .
and uh and that there is always a first lady connected to being the wife uh uh of the country 's leader .
uh .
uh , no . this is the official dimension .
this , this is the official dimension . yes .
meaning , there is this this official dimension . no .
meaning , as you %pw during the time of saddam , there uh was a women 's governmental committee .
yes .
it does not mean much that the iraqi government requested %pw women to %pw or that it went to women %pw peasants , and it went to different municipalities and cities and said let us make your rights our business .
no . it did not leave uh .
uh , i think that governments know where talk and follow - through stand . we are excellent in word because we say we established a governmental committee for women ,
but where are the deeds ?
ok . this is . yes .
i mean , where are the constitutional rights ? this is , for example , the most important thing that is happening to iraq - - constitutional rights and their implementation .
talk and follow - through on the subject uh of washington 's call this week for reform , especially with regard to women , uh will be the core of our talk in the second part of our show with our guests on this program after this break .
welcome back to our show from washington .
washington is inviting a group of women leaders in uh or from 15 arab and muslim countries on international women 's day .
again the talk is about the need for reform in the arab world
and that reform can not overlook women , as american president bush said in his speech last week .
it has to be clear that a society can not advance with just half of its capacity and talent .
this requires the full participation of women .
first of all , is there full participation of women in the american congress ?
first of all , if we want to to to discuss actions and to compare words and deeds uh with my uh three guests on our show , hanan ashrawi , uh lula zaqlama , and zaynab salbi .
maybe before i uh uh listen to uh their views uh i ought to start first with some statistics uh that were taken from uh uh an institution uh or organization of uh parliamentary parliamentary uh relations uh and it is or a federation %pw interparliamentary federation .
first of all , american women 's parliamentary participation in comparison to uh uh there is , first of all , uh uh participation by american women in the american congress .
we are talking about the american congress , the american house of representives : 65 female members or 14.9 percent .
in the american senate there are 14 members out of 100 - - in other words , 14 percent .
the total number of women in the american congress is nine uh 79 women out of 535 - - in other words , 14.8 percent .
first of all , if we compare that to other western societies in europe , we find , as we 've mentioned , that the american congress is 14.8 percent .
the parliament of the european union 31 percent .
the swedish parliament is the highest in europe with 45.3 percent women members .
the italian parliament is the lowest in europe with 11.5 percent .
let us compare parliamentary participation by women in the united states with women 's participation in arab parliaments .
the american congress is 14.8 percent .
the new iraqi parliament , which has not convened yet , has 31 percent - - 85 women .
that is , uh , double %pw the american congress .
the palestinian parliament : seven uh percent and maybe
unfortunately .
just seven percent , unfortunately , as dr. hanan said .
( laughter )
if we take a look at the rest of the %pw arab parliaments ,
uh as we 've mentioned , iraq now takes the lead with %pw uh 31 percent .
tunisia used to be in the lead , uh before the last iraqi elections : 43 women were in the tunisian parliament , or 22.8 percent .
in syria 30 women , or 12 percent .
morocco : 35 , or 10.8 percent .
sudan : 35 , or 9.7 percent .
algeria : 24 women in the parliament , or 6.2 percent .
jordan : six , or 5.5 percent .
palestine , as we have mentioned : five women , or seven percent .
uh , i mean , solely for the sake of comparison , in a state with an islamic regime , there is just iran : 12 women , or 4.1 percent ,
a small number , but it is higher than egypt , for example , with 13 women in the people 's assembly , and we haven 't counted the advisory council , with 2.9 percent
in oman : two women in the parliament , or 2.4 percent .
it has a higher percentage than lebanon %pw uh . lebanon has three women in parliament , or 2.3 percent .
yemen has just one woman in parliament , or 0.3 percent .
just as a reminder , the nation with the highest female parliamentary representation in the world is rwanda %pw uh with 39 women , or 48.8 percent ( that is , 49 percent ) , in the rwandan parliament .
zaynab salbi , you work with women in rwanda through your organization .
so why do women in rwanda suffer from all these problems and violence ? how can i reconcile 49 percent participation in the parliament and the terrible problems of women in rwanda ? you work with them .
there are three reasons %pw uh %pw %pw %pw that got rwandan women in this situation .
after %pw the genocide war , primarily after %pw the rwanda war , the society needed rwandan women .
there were half a million uh %pw orphans .
and , of course , half a million women were raped during the rwandan war and %pw and more than a million people were killed .
the government needed women , that is , to solve %pw this problem of the orphans .
there were no uh orphanages or uh shelters uh
yes .
enough to handle these things .
polygyny , of course , is not an acceptable way to solve this problem .
polygyny is not accepted by them and there were uh societies
yes .
dr. hanan looks at it with contempt .
in municipalities and villages .
( laughter )
there just , there were , just , women . all the men had been killed .
therefore , society , in general , needed women to solve the social problem ,
and this was uh smart thinking on the part of the society in general .
this is the first reason . the second reason , women were active . they were , and they arranged , uh and organized themselves in this situation .
but i think that women always join uh different organizations , and are active uh %pw in solutions .
but the third reason , and the most important to me , is that %pw the rwandan president is particularly interested in %pw women 's rights . he transformed %pw words into actions .
for instance , the rwandan constitution guarantees the right of women to 30 percent of elected positions .
but they encouraged and went to all the villages and municipalities , encouraging women to , uh %pw %pw informing them of their constitutional rights .
yes .
and encouraging them to vote in elections and seek representation .
so where did the 49 percent come from ? this came from the women 's movement and the social movement that declared that we can not solve the economic and social problems of society if women are not a big part uh of it .
but , just 2.5 percent of women in egypt . how , how do you explain this ?
all %pw %pw these women - - %pw businesswomen , activists and others - - we can not claim that the government has a problem with women , because as long as you are in the ruling party you are welcome if you are capable of succeeding .
uh .
then why ? what is the problem ?
uh it is %pw , in reality it is - - there is no problem .
in fact , %pw egyptian women %pw , i mean , have turned their attention to serving %pw the country in many other fields .
first of all , uh , i would also like to say that in the opposition parties , you %pw brought up %pw the parliament .
worse , yes .
worse , uh yes .
%pw tells me %pw and also in the %pw opposition parties in %pw
right .
the problem is also that egyptian women are not too involved in %pw the opposition parties .
uh , i see that %pw egyptian women enter fields to serve their country , to serve society through %pw ngos .
non - governmental organizations . yes .
if you look at the number %pw the non - governmental organizations in all fields , and and and many of them are in the political and social fields that serve society ,
they have turned %pw %pw their attention to these organizations which serve the country and serve women 's rights ,
and serve things %pw uh %pw women in all fields .
but i also say that in egypt , in a country like egypt , which has all these competent women - - you know egypt and the qualified women %pw it has - - there should be more women in all parties .
does a quota , and the enforcement of a quota , as in the iraqi experiment , is no %pw for every three men on the list there must be %pw the fourth , for every two %pw men there must be a woman .
a woman for every two men .
is that the solution ?
i think uh uh voting in the last municipal %pw elections presented a model that has greatly exceeded the quota . the mayor from hamas , i think .
i wish .
the municipality , yes , yes .
no . it is really independent , but hamas always adopts no , no .
independent uh , the american press encouraged it to
we , i mean , we know this woman and other women . . .
does this enhance her relationship with you ? or is there no difference ? ( laughing ) right .
no , this is not ( ( ) ) no no i , i , as far i am concerned , i have a very special relationship with activist women .
indeed , and we support everyone . we have a network of women whom we work with during the elections , and whom we empower , give opportunities to , and train , and uh public appearances .
% pw uh , uh i would say no .
look , quite frankly , we are %pw in a situation in the arab and islamic world , there is obvious discrimination against women .
there is an accumulation of injustice against women throughout history .
decision making and positions of power have been monopolized by men .
therefore , there has to be positive intervention to at least set the scales straight .
there is a battle happening now on the legislative level for that positive intervention , for the removal of %pw some of this injustice uh against women .
% pw in the battle in , in the local government election law in palestine , for instance , we settled it on the principle that there be at least two women in every uh polling center , in every municipality , and in every village council , etc . , at a minimum .
uh but when %pw uh and we know that in small societies , the more uh uh the circle narrows , the harder the competition , tribal and family issues start to rise , and the affiliations uh uh get smaller .
but we were surprised when we saw in the elections that the majority of women succeeded , based on their abilities and not %pw %pw the minimum , for example , within the whole uh uh electoral sphere .
there are some women who got the votes to the point
and not just this woman . they have taken , i mean , uh leading positions . we have a big battle .
yes . ok . there is a point i would like to . go ahead .
that is , no . but i would also like to clarify that the unites states , for example , this government , is against positive intervention and against uh against discrimination that favors women and does not have internal programs for reaching out to women and strengthening them ( ( ) ) .
and maybe also from %pw from %pw from the wrong impressions in the world about the american position with regard to women , uh there is a belief that america wants to use pressure to make abortion a universal right for women . it is quite the opposite . this is a conservative administration that has fought and failed to prohibit and criminalize abortion internationally uh in accordance with its conservative religious positions .
uh zaynab
not only abortion , even against uh contraception or
means %pw %pw that are now having an impact on , on united nations family planning programs .
definitely %pw uh . . .
from its position on contraception .
yeah , and %pw and , of course , it will have an effect on this %pw this policy regardless of abortion - - let 's put abortion aside - - but all means of contraception and the things that will have an impact on
yes .
many countries have the problem of numerous children , up to eight .
family planning
family planning to eight children , to ten children . . .
um , um
this means uh uh economic pressure , health services pressure , social pressure .
but what i want %pw no
yes .
the american policy at this stage they never , indeed , %pw uh harms women especially in african countries more than it benefits them .
but the important thing is that i would like to go back to %pw the point that women are active in national organizations and these kinds of things , but there isn 't enough representation of women uh in parliament .
in parliament .
when women are not present in the circle of negotiations , at the negotiating table , they are being negotiated . the first thing that is being negotiated , regardless of whether the government is religious or secular , regardless , the first thing that is negotiated is the issue of women .
so we have to , and in the interest of the nation and society , we have to allow women and guarantee that women are at %pw the negotiating table . this , this thing i go back to regardless of the ratio .
women %pw arab and non - arab governments must look at the rwandan government , that uh the presence of women is to its benefit , to the benefit of the government , and to the benefit of society .
ok uh one of the things that americans are also trying to present . there is uh a disgraceful record . for instance , the american department of state in its declaration %pw prides itself in sharing with the middle east uh " maybe " uh uh uh $ 129 million , of which $ 9 million is designated for women - - as if that is something to be happy about .
it is uh talk , all this talk about women being half of society , and then $ 9 million out of $ 129 million .
uh amnesty international 's report about iraq indicates that one of their problems in iraq is that we do not want american support or closeness because it harms us and exposes us to violence ,
meaning and uh at least in iraq , violence means killing , it means that we are spies .
but i would also like to ask you %pw uh all of you and dr. hanan , is there a problem ? now the american congress wants to spend $ 300 million %pw uh to support %pw societies %pw and organizations uh in the arab world .
doesn 't this tarnish it in the eye of public opinion , and isn 't some other solution necessary instead ? what would the other solution be ?
yes , there is uh , uh indeed an attempt to %pw westernize personal and domestic issues including women 's issues , reform , democracy , etc .
uh %pw in the arab world . many uh uh societies , societies , uh , institutions of civil society refuse to deal with the concepts and principles %pw that it presented , for instance , %pw
aid .
uh because there is basically
uh we made a decision in the coordinating committee uh the institution of the civil society , to have nothing to do with %pw the document that requires us to sign on the principle that we will not deal with terrorism or terrorists or anything of that sort . it was rejected .
there are , of course , a number of institutions .
uh %pw we have historically , uh , not uh uh received any american support and we have refused because the issue of trust is fundamental .
did you ask them in %pw the beginning to define terrorism ?
before
% pw no , and there was , we , i mean negotiated on behalf of the institutions of civil society and we changed the document a number of times . but there was a decision that we did not want to be , i mean , part of these american and western concepts regarding the palestinian struggle . this is one aspect .
yes .
from another aspect , the united states , for example , in , in an act of congress uh , uh america now does not want to support , for example , national ngos uh of the authority , the palestinian official political title . so it tries to divert the support to american institutions that work uh in palestine or with palestinian institutions uh that it is acceptable %pw uh to do business with from this point of view .
in the %pw civil society and in ngos . the third aspect , returning to %pw the issue of women in %pw national organizations , we view this as desertion , really , on the part of women from the positions of decision making .
women have to intervene boldly - - in a comprehensive feminine way - - to challenge the negative formality and to enter the spheres of authority and decision making . otherwise they will become marginalized , and they will be given secondary positions , and they will be told " limit your work either to the ministry of women 's affairs or to uh nominal ministries such as the ministry of social affairs , or remain within the civil societies because you volunteer service to society in these fields . "
yes . %pw ms . lula , i would like to hear your opinion .
uh and i also have something that , maybe , correct my information ,
a while back uh oum kalsoum was the first lady of egypt ( laughter ) . that changed during the time of president sadat .
mrs. jehan sadat became the first lady of egypt following the american tradition because in the american and western tradition the first lady is uh the wife of the leader .
isn 't this a deterioration that instead of society choosing the first lady , whether it is a singer or a creative person , the title of first lady has become a cultural matter ? does she have to be the leader 's wife ?
everything in the world changes .
yes .
we can 't remain the same forever , remain as we are , and uh oum kalsoum was the star of the east .
yes .
i mean %pw she was also called the star of the east .
but was the egyptian first lady , indeed , considered one of the people ? or was there grumbling among egyptians regarding the use of the expression " first lady ? "
there was not , yes .
no , i don 't , don 't think there was %pw i mean no one used to think of it from this point of view . i mean %pw uh this point of departure was not , it did not cross our minds that uh , is this an appropriate title ? ( ( ) ) but it is not being used ? yes , uh .
but it was only used in the era of mrs. jehan sadat and president sadat in egypt .
safiya zaghloul was the mother of the egyptians and not the first lady .
it started uh %pw like this . but %pw safiya zaghloul , mother of %pw , exactly .
but , i also agree also %pw to some extent with dr. hanan , in that we also , that we in egypt must %pw put ourselves , women must put themselves in leadership positions uh more than they are in %pw in %pw positions of political leadership .
you 'll find egyptian women in leadership positions in %pw in the world of %pw %pw business , uh excellent %pw bank presidents , %pw the private sector , bank presidents , chairmen of the board , and , and etc .
but in the political arena
politics
she should , she should fight . there is nothing preventing her .
not even tradition ?
not and not %pw . there are no obstacles .
no , not even tradition . there are some . not even tradition .
that 's all .
not even masculine thinking ?
i mean , ( laughter ) ( ( ) )
go ahead , i mean .
i think we are ( laughter )

this deployment comes in the wake of the indefinite postponement of the conference of donor states dedicated to the rebuilding of liberated areas in the south .
it has taken one year and four months since the liberation of the jezzine tribes in southeast lebanon from israeli occupation , from israeli occupation , and their return to their own country
for the lebanese army to take over security matters there .
the deployment operation is needed in an area which had not been covered by the deployment of the joint security forces which were commissioned by the lebanese parliament to maintain internal security in areas in southern lebanon which had previously been occupied by israel .
at least 300 soldiers from the lebanese army were deployed in the villages and hamlets of the jezzine tribes , carrying out patrols and setting up checkpoints in the first widespread military maneuver in the region extending deep into the southern region which was liberated last may .
firstly , this is to reassure .
it is to reassure everyone .
he left , there is a feeble army there . i mean , there are people who look after them .
for their part , jezzine notables , including the former minister edmond rizq , welcomed this step , but criticized the delay , given that the liberation began with the withdrawal from jezzine on june 1 1999 .
we waited for the army to be deployed which was delayed for reasons which were allegedly technical and possibly connected to the general situation in the region .
then , following the liberation of the whole south thanks to the resistance and perseverance of the martyrs who have been blessed by our nation , we also waited for the state to send the army .
but this was delayed and there were obstructions until the decision was taken to start in the jezzine area .
this is something we welcome .
echoes of the delight felt by the deployment of the lebanese army in the area reached washington , with the american administration welcoming this step . however , its position highlighted questions concerning the timing of this step and the degree to which it might be linked to placating the countries that have made the deployment of the lebanese army in the south a condition for holding a conference of the countries sponsoring aid to lebanon .
lebanese officials rejected any such link and said that the issue of deploying the army in jezzine was raised when the decision was taken to send joint security forces to the liberated areas .
however , the decision and implementation were delayed until arrangements were completed . whether or not the deployment of the lebanese army in the jezzine area is linked to providing donor countries with guarantees , this step has met with general approval , particularly as aid from donor countries is as much an issue that affects jezzine as it does the south of the country and lebanon .

bill richardson , the american energy secretary , stated that clinton has decided to release 30 million barrels of the reserve in several stages .

the end of the hostage crisis in the russian town of sochi has been announced . hostages were being held by an armed group in a hotel close to the town . all the kidnappers gave themselves up .

in other news , the yugoslav prime minister momir bulatovic has announced that the yugoslav constitution allows milosevic to remain in power until the middle of next year , regardless of the results of the presidential elections that are to be held next sunday .
with two days to go until the yugoslav elections , the prevailing atmosphere is one of anxiety , with fears about what may happen in yugoslavia after the results are announced in an election whose impartiality is questioned as belgrade refuses to allow european union monitors to supervise the election process .
however , it has allowed 52 observers from 12 countries that are not members of the european union or the organization for security and cooperation in europe to monitor the elections .
european union countries had previously issued a statement warning washington of their intention to immediately lift economic sanctions against yugoslavia if the opposition candidate vojislav kostunica wins .
with the end of an election campaign marred by tension , kostunica accused milosevic of being the reason behind the blockade imposed on serbia as a result of his holding onto power .
during the election campaign , nikhayo wortic , the third candidate for serbian power , called for past glories to be reclaimed and said : " we must think about the future and uphold the honor of our ancestors , however strong the opposition is in these elections . "
however , it looks as if the yugoslav president is determined to retain his presidential seat at any cost and will not refrain from rigging the election results , which the opposition has warned is a possibility .
the yugoslav prime minister said milosevic has reached the end of his term , whatever the results of the election .
he is holding onto the presidential seat to ensure his safety and to avoid being tried as a war criminal at the war crimes tribunal in the hague , even though the opposition candidate has stated that he would not cooperate with the court and hand over suspects because he regards it as a political court .
in view of the facts , fear and tension are prevalent in serbia itself concerning what the forthcoming elections might bring and which many local people say milosevic may win illegally .

this was during a press conference held by cohen in the japanese capital , tokyo , the last stop on cohen 's tour of asia which took in six countries in the region .
japan was the last stop on american defense secretary william cohen 's asia tour which included , in addition to japan , the philippines , singapore , indonesia , thailand and south korea .
during his visit , cohen met the japanese prime minister yoshiro mori to discuss developments in the korean peninsula and the issue of the american military presence in south korea , in addition to bilateral relations between the two countries .
during the meeting , the american defense secretary confirmed that the american administration would keep its forces in south korea , estimated to be over 37 000 soldiers , mentioning that north korea had reinforced its military capabilities over the last year which , according to him , requires the preventive military measures to continue .
cohen added , in a press conference held in tokyo , that pyongyang 's move to reduce tension in the korean peninsula is the sole reason for north korea receiving more economic support from japan , south korea and the united states .
cohen stated that among the steps needed are a reduction in the size of its advanced forces near the arms - free zone and an end to its long - range missile program , as well as getting rid of its chemical and biological weapons .
japan and the united states ' agreement to link economic aid to north korea to a reduction in its military capability has , in cohen 's view , contributed to north korea opening up to the outside world and calls for continued efforts to calm tensions in the korean peninsula .
but will this be achieved ?
opposition leader alejandro toledo and many opposition leaders and members of parliament have called for president fujimori 's immediate resignation and for the promised early elections to be held immediately .

president hosni mubarak once again stressed the arab identity of jerusalem and said that the holy city was occupied by israel in 1967 . it is not land belonging to israel and no arab citizen , muslim or coptic , could ever accept israel having sovereignty over jerusalem .
this was during a joint press conference held by president mubarak and the syrian president bashar al-assad calling for an urgent arab summit to discuss the bloody events that have taken place in the palestinian territories .
syrian president bashar al-assad left cairo to return to his country after a two - day visit , the first since he became the president of syria .
egypt and syria have called for an urgent arab summit to be held to discuss the recent israeli attacks on the palestinian people and islamic holy sites which have resulted in dozens of palestinians being killed and hundreds being wounded by the israeli occupation forces .
from this platform , i call for an arab summit to be held as quickly as possible so that arab countries can examine the issues concerning them because unless we are in agreement , we will never reach a solution or have solidarity and support for any arab issue .
this call came in the course of a joint press conference held by president hosni mubarak and the syrian president bashar al-assad at the end of their talks in cairo .
for his part , the syrian president bashar al-assad mentioned that he agreed with president mubarak with regard to holding a summit which he said had become necessary .
the call to hold a summit coincides with the dangerous events that flared up in jerusalem following a provocative visit by ariel sharon , leader of the extremist likud party .
the recent events happened , i don 't know if they were still preparing for negotiations but sharon went surrounded by forces .
sharon only has troops and he went into the holy shrine .
why is he doing it now ?
have the arabs violated the peace process ?
is it to say that jerusalem is not arab ?
it 's well known that jerusalem has been occupied in 1967 .
president mubarak warned that such developments would further stall the peace process if no just and permanent solution to the jerusalem issue is reached .
i have warned that jerusalem and the holy shrine are the most serious and sensitive issues and could lead to a situation that nobody wants .
president mubarak expressed his deep regret that israeli forces had attacked palestinians while they were praying and said that this was wholly unacceptable .
president mubarak called for the withdrawal from east jerusalem to achieve stability and stressed that east jerusalem and the holy shrine have been occupied land since 1967 .
with regard to efforts to push forward syrian - israeli negotiations , president bashar al-assad mentioned damascus ' desire to achieve a permanent , just and comprehensive peace .
the syrian president held israel responsible for the current stalemate in syria 's progress and said that it was impossible to detach the resumption of negotiations from the inflamed situation in the occupied palestinian territories .
the facts point to the israelis not wanting a just and comprehensive peace .
negotiations can be resumed .
as far as we are concerned , regarding the resumption of syrian - israeli negotiations , president mubarak has said that developments in the current situation between the palestinians and israelis posed a big problem to the peace process .
on the subject of the situation in iraq , president bashar said that ending the suffering of the iraqi people is now a duty .
in reply to a question concerning the possibility of egypt and syria sending flights to baghdad , president mubarak said he was not against special flights being made in the same way as other countries have done .
presidents mubarak and bashar emphasized the strength of syrian - egyptian relations as a basis for joint arab work at a time when the arab nation and the peace process are facing dangerous challenges .
students organized a one - hour peaceful sit - in at the american university which over 1500 male and female students took part in .
the clips we received from the university 's media center show that the demonstration began with a speech by some palestinian students studying at the university explaining the dimensions of the situation in the palestinian territories .
we are moved by the issue of the ban on friday prayers and the things that have happened and the israeli president 's visit .
we were affected by the matter and decided we had to do something .
we started thinking about doing something yesterday and at four o ' clock yesterday , we decided we would demonstrate , especially when we heard more news about people being besieged and the savage things the israelis are doing .
we decided to demonstrate to express our views , i mean .
the truth is that even if we keep quiet , our voice is not going to go away .
the second thing is that we want to raise people 's awareness .
a lot of people are not aware of what 's going on and we 're trying to tell people what they don 't know .
on this point , we wanted them to think just for the sake of thinking .
students also burned the israeli flag and pictures of some israeli leaders during the demonstration .
the main thing we were focusing on in the sit - in today was to make people more aware because there is something called the jerusalem problem .
and jerusalem must remain arab , we can 't lose it .
at the end of the sit - in , students prayed for the souls of palestinian martyrs and issued a statement which the president of the student 's union said would be sent to the american embassy in cairo and the arab league to call for a definitive solution to israeli practices .
the students ' position on these events can be interpreted as solidarity with the palestinian people .
this peaceful demonstration organized by students at the american university in cairo came as a condemnation of all israeli massacres against the people of this nation and at the same time calls on the international community , and the arab community in particular , to adopt a decisive position on these practices .
from cairo , mohamed hamdi , nile news channel .
in response to the brutal raids by israel on the towns of ramallah and gaza , various reactions to the events came one after another .
in the town of sharm el - sheikh , which hosted a summit between president hosni mubarak and the jordanian monarch king abdullah ii , president hosni mubarak and the jordanian monarch called on israel to stop all acts of violence against their palestinian brothers .
in muscat , the sultanate of oman decided to cut trade relations with israel in solidarity with the palestinians .
in washington , the white house asked palestinian and israeli leaders to do all that they can to contain the violence .
president bill clinton expressed his deep concern with regard to the escalation in the middle east .
clinton said the alternative to the peace process was becoming apparent before our eyes now and requires steps to be taken to remedy this problem .
madeleine albright , the american secretary of state , called for self - control .
kuwait also condemned the brutal israeli attack on the palestinian nation and called on all arab and muslim countries and the international community to stand up against these attacks .
turkey called on israel to immediately stop the bombing of the palestinian towns of ramallah and gaza .
france expressed regret over all the violent incidents in gaza and ramallah and encouraged both sides to refrain from any acts that would irreparably harm the peace process .
in britain , the british prime minister called on barak and arafat to restore calm .
as part of its solidarity with the palestinian people and its opposition to the israeli aggression they are facing , the pharmacists ' union organized a public conference in support of jerusalem .
as for christian participation in the conference , abba bassani , the bishop of helwan said : " a united stance is required from all the arab leaders because the attack on palestine and on any arab country is an attack on us all ,
especially as palestine has christian and muslim holy sites and we will not stand by and watch and believe their lies which have become blatant and apparent and clear to all . "
as for the reasons for holding the conference , the president of the pharmacists ' union said : " we represent the vanguard of this educated nation ,
the forefront of this nation . the professional unions represent this nation 's elite .
because this is how it interacts with what is happening and it is our duty to inform the egyptian and arab people of what is really going on and our role is to support and assist the palestinian people whom international zionism , led by barak , has decided to exterminate .
we urge the egyptian people in particular and the arab nations to take note and rise up and leap to the defense of this nation .
they are bombing with their planes .
they are bombing not only muslims but also christians .
the european world must be made aware that its weapons are killing christians , religious christians , who are possibly more religious than them and are closer to the christian religion and closer to god almighty .
the third point that i would like to make is that we must be aware that america is an israeli colony and not the other way round .
if only america could see that it is a game in the hands of israel and not the other way round .
this is what i wanted to say today and i would like to thank the egyptians and his excellency president hosni mubarak , the first to know of the situation .
the medicine went the same night . they didn 't wait for the pharmacists ' union or for anyone else but we would also like to thank the pharmacists ' union for their efforts .
however , the egyptian government reacted quickly and sent doctors and medicine and brought the injured from palestine .
conferences and angry popular demonstrations will not stop while the israeli attack on occupied palestinian territory continues .

the court rejected the government 's claim that the libyan president gaddafi enjoys immunity as a head of state .
for its part , the french foreign ministry stated that france hopes to continue normalizing its relationship with libya in spite of legal proceedings against the libyan leader .
in this precedent , the first in the history of french law , the indictment chamber of the paris court of appeal decided to allow the investigating judge fougere to look into a suit brought by the association of terrorist attack victims against the libyan leader colonel muammar gaddafi , as part of the case into the attack on a plane which led to the plane exploding in ' 89 over the niger desert and the deaths of all 170 passengers .
the case was filed last july and the investigating judge decided last october that the matter should be looked into officially .
however , the prosecution appealed against the decision because french legislation protects heads of states from being brought before the french courts .
the indictment chamber of the court of appeal decided in a closed session that this specificity does not apply to terrorist attacks . ramses cezny , the lawyer for victims ' association , announced the decision upon leaving the session .
the court acknowledged that , while legally valid , immunity from public prosecution does not apply to acts such as terrorism , which is a highly satisfactory decision for us .
the president of the attack victims ' association , francoise rudetzki , expressed her satisfaction and announced the association 's next move .
we will provide additional statements and evidence for the investigation file which proves that he gave orders and that he played a role in this bombing . we will also be seeking an arrest warrant .
if he comes to marseille , there will be pressure to arrest him .

for its part , the right - wing national radical party , led by vojislav , has decided not to participate in the government and abstained from voting , criticizing the national uprising which took place on october 5th , considering it a revolution .
with regard to the parliamentary elections , the cabinet stressed that the elections had been free and fair and that president hosni mubarak had offered the egyptian people a democratic plan and political reform . it is a national project that will lead the country into the next century .
dr. yusuf wali , the nationalist party 's secretary - general , said the party had not agreed to reinstate some candidates who had previously been expelled from the party and had achieved success as independent candidates .
mr. kamal shazil , the nationalist party 's deputy secretary - general and the organization 's secretary , said the party had apologized to a number of independent candidates for refusing to allow them to join the party .
mr. safwat sharif , the information minister , said that egypt 's image in the foreign media reflected the country 's democratic progress and that the disappearance of some party symbols confirms the electorate 's complete freedom in choosing their candidates .
the cabinet also reviewed a report presented by the foreign minister mr. amr musa on the results of the extraordinary arab summit hosted by egypt .
the report stated that the summit had succeeded in achieving a number of results , the most important of which was the arab nation 's responsibility with regard to the palestinian issue and the palestinians ' right to fully reclaim their lands and their right to create an independent state with jerusalem as its capital . it also called on the international community to shoulder its responsibility with regard to prosecuting any persons who commit crimes against the palestinian people . finally , it called for the provision of material support to the palestinian people through the creation of two funds , one to preserve the identity of jerusalem and the second to support the families of the martyrs of the al-aqsa intifada .
mr. safwat sharif , the information minister , said that the cabinet had invited civil servants and the public and private sectors to contribute one day 's wages this month as part of egypt 's support for the palestinian people in applying the arab summit decision concerning material support for the palestinian intifada .
the cabinet called for the means to be set up to accept donations from organizations , companies and individuals wishing to donate . this will be made possible through the setting up of accounts , to be announced soon , to receive donations at all branches of the following banks : bank of egypt , al-ahli bank , cairo bank and alexandria bank .
in its session chaired by dr. atif abid , the cabinet reiterated egypt 's position as a supporter of the rights of the palestinian nation to its land and asked the foreign ministry to coordinate with sisterly arab states to set in motion the decisions made at the recent arab summit .
at the same time , it rejected attempts to go further than this summit which constitutes a fifth column aimed at thwarting joint arab action .

arafat sent an urgent letter to putin via the russian envoy to the palestinian territories , asking him to hold this meeting .
recent developments in the palestinian territories , which have seen an escalation in violence , are causing the kremlin great concern .
a statement by president putin 's official spokesman said that the russian leadership is pursuing its intensive efforts to resolve the middle east crisis through continuous contact with the two sides in the dispute , as well as a series of telephone conversations the foreign minister igor ivanov has held with the secretary - general of the united nations and the foreign ministers of the united states , britain and france in the last few hours . it also stressed the importance of initiating international efforts to settle the dispute .
news of yasser arafat 's arrival in the russian capital moscow to hold talks with president putin met with a positive reaction in political circles in moscow .
commenting on what the talks might deal with , the leader of the liberal democrat party vladimir zhirinovsky said : " i am certain that president putin will propose a new initiative during his meeting with arafat and , in my view , russia must stand by the arabs . "
this is in keeping with the official position on the crisis in much of the russian media , a matter pointed out by dr. andrei istivano , a political affairs expert .
there is no doubt that most of the media is sympathetic to the palestinian nation 's just struggle for its rights and sovereignty over its land .
dr. andrei istivano referred to tangible steps taken to normalize the situation in the palestinian territories .
one of the most important points in the discussions is finding the mechanism needed to stop violence in the region , possibly even sending a group of monitors in some form or the other .
as for the russian people , there are clear divisions between palestinian supporters and those sympathetic to israel .
but the general opinion among the public tends towards backing a peaceful solution .
it is necessary to sit at the negotiating table with all three sides , and especially russia .
there is no alternative other than resolving this crisis peacefully .
it is worth mentioning that analysts believe that russia 's position will be characterized by balance and moderation during discussions on the crisis at the security council 's emergency session .
most people think russia will focus on inviting both sides in the dispute to avoid taking steps that will lead to a subsequent escalation in the violence .
yasser arafat 's forthcoming discussions with russian officials will reveal the extent of russia 's role as a custodian of the peace process through initiatives that will put a stop to the current escalating tensions in the middle east .

the committee chairman , former american senator george mitchell , said in a press conference held in new york that the committee has not yet set a date to visit the occupied territories but will finish preparing its report by next march at the latest .
mitchell said after his meeting with kofi anan , the secretary - general of the united nations , that he had not yet formed a technical committee .
he said the team would probably include military affairs specialists to investigate the acts of violence in the region over the past two months that have so far led to the deaths of nearly 180 people .
however , he avoided answering questions related to whether the team would include a large number of military and police monitors
annan suggested this as an alternative to the palestinian proposal for a 1000 - strong military monitoring force to be sent to the region .
mitchell stressed the need for the committee to act independently . it consists of five prominent personalities on the international scene who are calling for an end to the continued violence in the occupied territories .
president hosni mubarak had a telephone conversation with the yemeni president ali abdullah salih on tuesday , in which they discussed the current arab situation , particularly the developments in palestine in the light of the recent al-aqsa intifada and following up the implementation of the decisions made at the extraordinary arab summit .
president mubarak also offered his best wishes to the yemeni president on the occasion of the holy month of ramadan .
president mubarak gave an interview on radio egypt 's general network in which he stated that peace is an objective that we are all working towards .
he said that everything that has happened in the region since the october war and up to the current intifada has been to bring peace to the region .
president mubarak added that those who talk about war are not aware of the tragedy left behind by wars and said that egypt had lost around 200 000 dead and injured in wars .
thousands of demonstrators gathered outside the presidential palace where protests to the sound of music , in an atmosphere akin to a carnival , continued until the early hours of the morning .
meanwhile , estrada 's supporters gathered in large numbers in another part of the capital at a time when the philippine president joseph estrada faces a severe political crisis that could topple him .
the philippine capital manila saw opposing demonstrations on the controversial issue of estrada 's trial .
thousands of estrada supporters gathered to voice their support for the philippine president with the approach of his trial on charges of receiving bribes from gambling gangs .
estrada told his supporters that he is ready to face trial by the senate and that he is certain that he will be cleared of all charges against him .
on the other side , thousands of demonstrators gathered to demand the resignation of the philippine president .
the protest against estrada had the feel of a carnival as bands followed one another onto a moving stage to sing songs ridiculing estrada .
demonstrators also used two trucks attached to each other as a platform and carried a big picture of estrada with the word " guilty " written on it .
they burned an effigy showing estrada as a godzilla - like dinosaur that appeared in a series of movies , knocking down buildings and destroying entire towns .
these contradictory tendencies come as estrada prepares to stand on trial before the philippine senate on december 7th .
at least two - thirds of the senate , or 15 of its 22 members , are needed to convict estrada or to remove him from his position .
this came in a speech by amr musa at celebrations held by the united nations ' egypt association as part of the international day of solidarity with palestine .
it called on the international community to shoulder its responsibilities in stopping these attacks .
a number of public personalities , journalists and media figures , alongside a number of palestinians living in cairo , took part in the celebrations .
in his speech to the audience , dr. abdul ahad jamaluddin , president of the united nations ' egypt association , emphasized the egyptian people 's solidarity with the palestinian people in their legitimate struggle to gain their full and extensive rights and said that the celebrations sent a message to the international community 's conscience .
all the representatives of the united nations are sending a message .
the egyptian people are standing firmly alongside the brave palestinian people and the palestinian martyrs that the palestinian nation gives daily in order to realize the legitimate rights of the palestinian people .
the egyptian people will always be , as they have always been , with the palestinian people .
in this way it is also expressing the will of the arab nation , from the atlantic ocean to the gulf , which has risen up against the brutal israeli attacks which israel carries out on a daily basis .
in spite of that , we hear them boasting and saying they want peace .
ambassador zahdi al-qadra , palestine 's ambassador to cairo , prepared a speech which was read on his behalf by ambassador haroun hashim rasheed in which he affirmed the palestinian people 's commitment to its struggle and its determination whatever the difficulties and however great the challenges .
on this day of solidarity with the palestinian people , our nation looks to the united nations which has had a role in the subjugation and expulsion the palestinian people are suffering .
for it created israel which lives corruptly , defying the world , the whole world , and especially the united nations .
mr. amr musa , the foreign minister , said in a speech , read on his behalf by ambassador ramzi ezzedin , that solidarity with the palestinian people must be translated into a tangible reality and practical measures on the part of the international community .
the world 's solidarity with the palestinian nation at this precise moment in its history and in the history of its struggle must be translated into practical steps aimed at protecting it and enabling it to attain its rights .
the arab family leads the way in this direction .
this year 's celebration of the international day of solidarity with the palestinian nation clearly reveals the international community 's inability to provide adequate protection for the palestinian people who are being subjected to a war of extermination and to barbaric israeli attacks .
many people are raising question marks around the role of the united nations and other international and regional organizations concerning what is happening in the palestinian territories .

four weeks after the american presidential elections , the legal campaign fought by the democratic candidate al gore to wrest the state of florida from his republican rival bush junior returns to the state 's supreme court and could put an end to the race to the white house .
american vice - president al gore suffered a painful setback when the lyon county court judge , sanders solz , rejected his demand for a manual recount of 14 000 votes in two of florida 's counties where the democrats hold a majority .
al gore 's legal team maintains that these votes include enough votes to change the result in favor of gore but solz disagreed with them .
it seems that the republicans have gotten used to the idea that bush junior is going to be the 43rd president of the united states of america .
bush appears to be ready to receive his first report from the american central intelligence agency , the c . i . a . , and intends to meet with advisors who are likely to become part of his administration .
al gore 's lawyers have indicated that they hope to appeal to the florida supreme court in the next few days .

eyewitnesses confirmed that the police had fired on demonstrators in aboub and ouahi , ouattara 's strongholds on the outskirts of abidjan . the city was paralyzed when ouattara 's supporters asked that he be allowed to put himself forward as a candidate in the parliamentary elections which are to be held next sunday but the supreme court rejected this for reasons related to his nationality .
following these protests , the cote d ' ivoire 's president laurent gbagbo announced a state of emergency in the country and a week - long night curfew .
gbagbo said he did not intend to submit either to internal or external pressure on the legal process to annul the supreme court 's decision not to allow ouattara 's nomination to the elections which he insisted would take place on the set date to return civilian rule to the country after the first military coup d ' etat in december 1999 .

an advance force comprised of 150 soldiers arrived by air on wednesday .
the border dispute between asmara and addis ababa began two years ago and has cost both sides tens of thousands of lives .

the cabinet and the ruling ethiopian peoples revolutionary democratic front in addis ababa ratified the comprehensive peace agreement formally with eritrea .
during his meeting with the irish prime minister bertie aherne , the american president called for all sides in northern ireland , whether or not they have signed the peace treaty , to stay calm and not to allow the peace process to collapse , seeing this as a necessity rather than an option .

ladies and gentlemen , the voice of america presents you with views on a range of various issues .
the following is a comment on the us government 's policies .
in the last century , ukrainians suffered huge problems .
millions of them perished during the soviet famine of the thirties , their land was divided , books were banned , writers isolated , workers detained and artwork plundered . the despots have gone now and ukraine is striving for reform .
in his latest visit to ukraine , president clinton urged ukrainians to continue their efforts . he said that communism has been defeated in ukraine , however the victory of committing fully to establishing a democracy based on the free market hasn 't been realized yet .
it is clear that countries that enjoy high living standards and low poverty rates are democracies based on the free market , but moving towards this type of democracy can be difficult .
from lithuania to poland and the czech republic , the radical reform programs resulted in difficulties before they brought about prosperity .
ukraine realizes that in order to share in the economic success of other ex - communist states , it is very important that it promotes the rule of law and builds a civilized society .
it is also important to protect the freedom of the press and to eliminate corruption .
ukraine has adopted some measures to trim down the bureaucratic government system , allow private ownership of land and encourage interest in enterprise .
all this will help attract the foreign investment that the country needs .
some of the leftovers of communism which ukraine ought to get rid of are the destruction of the environment resulting from the accident at the chernobyl nuclear power plant in 1986 .
the ukrainian president leonid kuchma announced that the plant will close permanently on december 15 .
the united states will offer funds to help construct a building to contain the radiation from the damaged plant .
american funds will also be spent on improving the safety procedures at other nuclear power plants in ukraine .
it is clear that the plunder ukraine was subjected to in the past is considered a large obstacle that must be overcome .
the government has taken important steps towards building a democratic society based on the free market but a lot of efforts are still required and this is the most appropriate time for ukraine to move ahead .
that was the comment stating the policies of the american government .

ladies and gentlemen , we brought you this morning 's detailed news bulletin .
here are the main headlines now .
the united states said that it expects the middle east talks will take place on the appoined date , despite the problems in the israeli prime minister ehud barak 's government .
syria denied that its foreign minster said that the withdrawal of the syrian army from lebanon will lead to civil war .
the sudanese foreign minister mustafa osman ismail said that a positive dialogue is taking place between his country and the united states .
the international red cross announced that 150 people were killed and 700 others were injured as a result of fighting between ugandan and rwandan forces in kisangani in congo - kinshasa .
eritrea said that it has accepted a ceasefire proposal put forward by the organization of african unity to end its war with ethiopia .
our morning news roundup continues with our listeners in north africa .
sudan is intensifying diplomatic efforts to end the international sanctions imposed on it since ' 96 .
on this issue , we held this telephone interview with the sudanese foreign minister dr. mustafa osman ismail . we started by asking him about the nature of sudan 's efforts . he said
% eh firstly there are efforts on several fronts .
the first front is that since the sanctions were imposed on sudan , sudan has had to respond to the demands of these sanctions .
this is what we started to do more than a year ago .
the sanctions were originally imposed after a failed attempt to assassinate president mubarak in addis .
the sanctions were imposed on sudan for three reasons .
the first reason is cooperating to arrest the suspects .
the second reason is that sudan re - establishes normal relations with neighbouring countries .
the third reason is that sudan cooperates with other countries in combating terrorism .
in this respect , we concentrated on these areas until we came to a point where ethiopia and egypt agreed with us that sudan had cooperated enough .
and they delivered a letter to this effect to the security council .
then with regard to our relations with neighbouring countries
during this year which start ends in this % eh june , we restored relations with almost all neighbouring countries : with the emirates , algeria , tunisia , egypt , kuwait and with saudi arabia and - % eh also with neighbouring countries with % eh % eh ethiopia , with eritrea .
relations as well as dialogue has started with uganda .
% eh there is ongoing dialogue with the european union .
relations are starting to move forward .
thus , our efforts were not limited - - - not limited only to restoring relations with neighbouring countries , they extended to countries even further off .
as concerns combating terrorism % eh we have signed all the international treaties which we weren 't signatories to before .
a few weeks ago we sent the united nations a list of six treaties sudan has signed .
we also took the initiative and ratified the arab agreement for combating terrorism , and the african agreement for combating terrorism .
we met delegations from a number of states to discuss their security concerns with sudan .
i can say that we are in a position where we can say that sudan is secure and there are no indications as to the presence of terrorists in the country , or support or shelter for them . nor is there anything to link it to - terrorism . on the contrary , we now believe that terrorism is an international problem which everyone ought to cooperate to combat .
dr. mustafa osman ismail , which authorities is sudan curently in contact with to get support for its efforts aimed at lifting the sanctions imposed on it ?
after we dealt with - foundations , the foundations on which the sanctions were based , we said , which authorities % eh is it essential to talk to , to lift the sanctions .
i mentioned egypt and ethiopia who supported the lifting the sanctions .
also it was essential to talk to the non - aligned , the group which adopted these resolutions when they were imposed .
it 's true that they made some amendments to them , but in the end , they adopted these resolutions and voted for them .
therefore the non - aligned movement , which is made up of the - - %pw the african group , the arab group , the % eh latin american group and a number of eastern european countries , at its meetings , this group decided to submit a request to the security council to have the sanctions lifted . the arab and the african groups also did that .
then the - the - the third pivot focuses on un security council members .
the whole group of non - aligned countries stand behind sudan to have the sanctions lifted .
the majority of un security council member states now support sudan to have the sanctions lifted .
it remains that we realize that we must talk to the american administration because as you know , relations between sudan and the united states remain strained .
one of the reasons as you mentioned % eh combating terrorism and other things .
recently , these relations % eh have started to develop somewhat .
therefore , we are even with the % eh evidence from the united nations that these sanctions have a negative effect on humanitarian aid and the role of the united nations for peace in sudan .
i remember when the africans held %pw the african foreign ministers held the first ministerial conference on % eh % eh refugees in december ' 98 . the united nations considered this conference to be in breach of the sanctions .
leading personalities were not able to participate in this conference .
a few weeks ago , % eh % eh the participating partners decided to hold a conference in sudan to % eh discuss the issue % eh of developing the south after the war .
after all the delegates arrived , headed by an american , the united nations sent a letter saying that this meeting contravened the sanctions imposed on sudan .
therefore , the sanctions themselves have also started % eh % eh to directly affect the role of the united nations , both on peace and humanitarian issues , which necessitates these sanctions being lifted .
at the moment % eh all our efforts are focused on dialogue with % eh the united states of america , talking to members of the security council , talking to the non - aligned , talking to ethiopia and egypt so that we can lift these sanctions and to enable sudan to fulfill its required role in the regional and international milieus . lifting the sanctions will also enable the united nations , the security council and other organizations to perform the roles entrusted to them in helping sudan to achieve peace and join the international community .
% eh speaking of the united states , % eh your excellency , how do you rate the relationship between washington and khartoum at this time ?
of course there is an ongoing dialogue .
this dialogue % eh % eh started a while ago .
% eh it was given , i can say , a positive eh % boost by harry johnston 's visit to sudan in - - two months ago .
next week we will also receive harry johnston in a follow up to his first visit .
we believe that his coming visit next week % eh is % eh confirmation % eh at least that his previous visit registered some kind of progress in relations between the two countries .
% eh the dialogue is not limited only to harry johnston % eh although we believe that the dialogue with him is important because firstly he is % eh a presidential envoy , and because he % eh % eh % eh specializes in one of the most important areas which is peace and humanitarian issues .
but certainly this is so that the united states can perform the role required of it , which we know is important . we must strive to normalize bilateral relations between us and the united states and this - this - this - and the dialogue on this side as well is advan - advancing steadily .
i can 't say that it is , i mean , % eh it has reached the required level , but it is certainly continuing . it is % eh and seeing progress , although slowly .
your excellency , is there a move by the us administration towards restoring diplomatic relations between the united states and sudan to normalcy and to lift what some consider to be a diplomatic sanction ?
by god , we hope so now .
there is no diplomatic sanction on sudan by the united states .
i mean , there is nothing preventing us now from reopening the sudanese embassy with full diplomatic staff in washington .
but as you know we recalled our diplomatic mission after the hostility between us and the united states reached a level where the united states bombed a plant with missiles .
for - for pharmaceuticals , which is the eh shifa pharmaceutical plant , considering that it was a factory for chemical weapons .
and despite our insistence on giving an investigative committee the chance , whether american or international , to come and investigate this plant and find out whether it is a factory producing medicine , chemicals or chemical weapon , ; this hasn 't happened as the united states believes that this issue should be resolved bilaterally .
we are not objecting to a bilateral resolution and we hope to arrive at a bilateral resolution .
when we reach it , we will surely restore the sudanese diplomatic mission with its full staff , in % eh washington .

our correspondent in congress , david swan , says that the senate is starting its special investigations by holding a hearing session today .

ladies and gentlemen , in about 5 minutes we will present you with the news headlines at the start of the second half of this period which comes to you at precisely 4 am washington time .
voice of america in washington .
ladies and gentlemen , voice of america radio presents various opinions on a variety of issues .
the following is a comment on the policy of the american administration .
the united states and russia don 't always agree but at this time they are worried by the terrorist threat rising in areas occupied by the taliban in afghanistan .
recently , karl inderfurth , assistant secretary of state and the russian deputy foreign minister a . b . losyukov met to discuss this threat and the continuing crisis in afghanistan .
in a joint statement the united states and russia stressed that the taliban movement must implement the united nations security council 's resolutions which aim to find a political settlement to the afghan crisis .
the statement also called on the taliban to comply with security council resolution no . 1267 to hand over osama bin laden , head of the terrorist al qaeda group .
the taliban have to take real steps without delay to dismantle the terrorist structures in afghanistan which constitute a threat to the stability and security of the region and other regions in the world .
afghanistan has been submerged in civil war and political disturbances for 22 years .
since 1978 , one million afghans died and several million have been injured or displaced and most of the country 's infrastructure has been destroyed .
90 % of the country , including the capital kabul , is under the control of the taliban , dominated by pashtos , while the afghanistan united front controls most of the north east of the country .
both the taliban and the afghanistan united front have committed grave human rights abuses .
while the taliban practices repressive policies as concerns human rights , especially with women and girls , it also provides a safe refuge to osama bin laden and al qaeda .
this terrorist group is responsible for the bombing of the american embassies in kenya and tanzania in 1998 .
300 men , women and children were killed , most of them africans . many others were injured in these two horrid attacks .
last october the united nations imposed sanctions on the taliban .
the taliban can end these sanctions by doing what it should have done a long time ago , that is complying with the international demands and bringing bin laden to justice .
few nations in the world have suffered as much violence recently as the afghan people .
it is time for the taliban to stop their repressive practices against human rights and end the violence , expel international terrorists and strive to find a peaceful solution to the serious economic , social and political problems the country suffers from .
this comment expressed the policy of the american administration .

the morning world from voice of america in washington .
ladies and gentlemen , in about 23 minutes from now we will present you with a summary of the most important news .
it is planned that dr. bashar hafez al-assad 's nomination by the ruling baath party in syria to take over the presidency of the republic will pass
through the constitutional channels this month and then be put to a popular referendum .
more details from jumana al tamimi currently in damascus .
seven years ago there was nothing in the life of dr. bashar hafez al-assad to indicate the likelihood of him holding any official positions .
during the early 90s he chose to go to britain and specialize in ophthalmology after studying medicine in damascus .
but the death of his eldest brother basil in a car accident on the 21st of january 1994 - n changed the course of dr. bashar 's life when he was forced to return to damascus .
and thus began his participation in many syrian affairs , including political ones .
over the past years he has headed the syrian scientific society for informatics .
press reports said that his humility and personal integrity made him more trustworthy when he recently led the anti - corruption campaign in syria .
dr. bashar al-assad , who is currently 34 , joined the military academy in the city of homs , north of damascus .
and started to climb through the military ranks , being promoted from head of a tank battalion in 94 to a staff major in 97 and a colonel at the beginning of 99 .
after the death of his father , syrian president hafez al-assad , dr. al-assad was promoted to the position of lieutenant general and also appointed general commander of the army and syrian defense forces .
the decision was made one day after the syrian national assembly passed a bill to lower the minimum age of a president of the republic from 40 to 34 years , an act that paves the way to dr. bashar 's presidency of syria .
hours after the parliamentary step , the national leadership of the ruling baath party in syria held a meeting at which it decided unanimously to nominate dr. bashar al-assad for the presidency of the republic .
it is expected that the national assembly , where the baath party constitutes the majority of members , will hold a session on the 25th of this month to discuss the decision of the baath party and put it to a national referendum .
mr. abdel kader kaddoura , the speaker of the syrian national assembly and member of the national leadership of the baath party , said that young people give the movement a new momentum .
at a press conference convened in damascus last monday he added that serving the country is not tied to a person 's age .
- that dr. bashar al-assad is young
% yes , those who know the history of syria know that the great late president hafez al-assad worked in politics at an age younger that that of dr. bashar al-assad .
he was the maker of march when he was 33 years old .
and therefore these young people give the movement a new momentum .
you 've heard more than once while under president hafez al-assad what was known to some of the media as change for continuity .
we don 't believe in this slogan .
we believe that every citizen in syria who is able to give must give and must assume his position regardless to his age . if he is able to give , and is with the masses of this nation , he is welcome whether he is from the party or a member of one of the front parties or is independent .
duty , love for your country and serving and defending the country are not tied to any age of a man 's life .
it should be mentioned that in the past few months dr. al-assad has visited a number of arab states besides france and discussed a number of issues with officials including bilateral relations and the middle east peace process , including syrian - israeli peace negotiations .
political analysts see these stumbling negotiations as one of the challenges that dr. bashar hafez al-assad will face in the future .

we begin with what the american washington times newspaper published regarding the progress of the democratic process in tunisia .
the newspaper said that tunisia , in its 45th year of independence , faces a major obstacle which is the amount of information the government can tell the people about the problems faced by the country , without making them worse .
the newspaper added that discussions about the freedom of information started as an initiative by the tunisian president zine el abidine ben ali , who expressed his desire for the press to end years of servility and start talking openly . however , the paper said that tunisian newspapers have so far preferred to take the safe path in politics by praising president ben ali and his performance and publishing his photos on the front pages almost daily .
the paper went on to say that the achievements made by the government are a reality which cannot be debated but it added its immunity to criticism was a source of mistrust and accusations , especially among liberal newspapers in france .
it said that those papers accuse mr. ben ali of having absolute rule , transforming the country into a society subjected to severe restrictions , whereas a number of arab governments feel that the reforms in tunisia are dangerously progressive , especially those related to women .
the paper said , however , that tunisia , which is located in what a top official called a " large residential area that is hard to live in " , has succeeded in overcoming many difficulties and breaking traditional taboos , giving examples such as the banning of political islam , a measure aimed at maintaining the progressive reforms and the commitment of the government to secularism and western principles .
the paper also pointed to women 's participation in development and political processes and said that among tunisian women there are pilots , two ministers in the cabinet and members of parliament who won 20 percent of the seats in municipal councils .
the paper went on to say in its discussion of tunisia 's economic achievements that tunisia was able to keep the inflation rate at 2.71 % .
also , four out five homes have electricity and drinking water , while birth rates which were previously high have been kept under control to remain at the level of most european countries .
this is in addition to the rising level of individual income from 30 us dollars per annum on the eve of independence to 2100 us dollars last year .
we continue with what the washington times paper published about the progress of the democratic process in tunisia .
the paper quoted the tunisian minister for culture abdel baki al-harmasi as saying in this regard that tunisia has almost fulfilled all the necessary prerequisites of a modern state .
it added , quoting him , that the choices defined by the state are right and that the country is busy working . the government is trying to increase political pluralism and encourage the press to speak openly . however , the paper said that tunisian newspapers are losing readers because of their silence even on secondary political issues and the circulation of the four arabic and three french dailies has plummeted considerably .
it pointed out that around 40 % of tunisians own satellite dishes to watch television channels from france and the arab world .
the american washington times said that when it became apparent to president ben ali that a restricted press bears adverse results , he made a decision to reform it .
it quoted him as saying in a conversation with a group of tunisian newpaper editors that recently they have been publishing the same reports and photos and that he doesn 't need to read more than one paper a day .
it added , still quoting him , that tunisia needs a higher level of media and warned at the same time about what he called terrorist propaganda , by which the paper said he meant the call in the tunisian press for the establishment of an islamic state .
the american % foreign magazine allotted space to dealing with the problem of some north african citizens immigrating illegally to europe .
this matter , it said , was recently making a strong appearance again in the news .
at the beginning , the magazine mentioned the arrest of 170 moroccans by the spanish police in the past few days as they were trying to enter spain on a fishing boat .
it quoted official sources as saying in this matter that the spanish authorities have arrested over three thousand people since last january .
five hundred and sixty six moroccans and others from south saharan states who were trying to enter spanish territories illegally from morocco .
the magazine continued , saying that a human rights organization in spain announced that at least 200 persons drowned in an attempt to reach the spanish shores .
it added that the spanish government is preparing a draft bill to strengthen procedures against illegal immigration on the one hand and to reduce the restrictions in immigration legislation to change the status of illegal migrants in spanish territories on the other hand .
the american magazine % foreign said that in addition to spain , scottish police in turn arrested two algerian boys , one 14 and the other 15 , after they entered scotland illegally .
the magazine said that the incident attracted much attention from the scottish media because those arrested were children , siblings and orphans .
the magazine quoted the scottish % foreign paper as saying about this matter , describing the incident , that the scottish authorities placed the two children behind bars in a prison along with murderers and rapists and that they were being treated like criminals .
it added , quoting the scottish paper , that organizations active in child protection see the jailing of the two algerian children , hicham and mohamed , as a breach of the united nations convention on human rights .
the magazine pointed out that this international law stipulates that children under eighteen should not be jailed with adults .
the american % foreign magazine said that it was not yet known what steps the scottish authorities will take in regard to the two detained algerian children .
but it pointed out that there is increasing pressure on the scottish government by a number of organizations to grant them asylum and provide them with protection .
with this , ladies and gentlemen , we reach the close of this episode of north africa in the international press , directed by sound engineer dick french and prepared and presented by rachid ja
in today 's episode of arabs in america , dr. nour sneige , professor of pathology at the university of texas ' md anderson cancer center in houston .
the program is prepared and presented by maha al-halabi rabie .
dr. nour sneige graduated from the faculty of medicine , university of damascus in 1972 and moved to the united states to specialize in breast cancers in women , and stayed to practice medicine at one of the most sophisticated research centers and hospitals in america .
she currently works as the head of the pathology department at the md anderson center in houston in the state of texas , which we visited .
what , then , is the definition of pathology ?
pathology generally c - - - is constituted of a number of fields , one of them anato - - - % eh the study of samples that are related or unrelated to cancers .
but also hematology , germs .
there is a number of fields in pathology .
and the study c - - - covers all these fields
then one p - - - practices all the areas or tries , if one has an interest , that is , in a specific field to concentrate on that specific area .
dr. nour sneige says that women have started to enter the medical field in large numbers , but they are not represented sufficiently in the field of oncology , especially in the arab world .
the percentage of women in the faculty of medicine at the university of damascus in the 70s was between 10 to 20 % , but now it has increased largely .
studying medicine and specialization require a long time , especially in the fields of research and pathology in which dr. nour sneige specializes .
so how does she balance her professional life and family duties ?
of course we work almost twice as much as men , but % eh % eh i have lots of help , especially from my husband and family % eh
they help me a lot at those times when i % eh % hm need more hours for work
support is very important % eh very important %
and where does dr. nour find the time to follow the latest research and read the medical periodicals % eh to keep her knowledge up to date in various medical fields ?
especially medicine % eh has no end of academic publications .
% eh one always needs to read and have information , the most up to date information .
and this is what keeps me always motivated t - - - to work , because there is always something new and there is no routine . % eh
there is always something new to read .
houston city and especially the md anderson center attracts lots of patients from around the world and from arab countries .
dr. nour says about this -
% yes , we have lots of patients from arab countries .
even here at - - - because there is a good number , there are special people who interpret for the patients in a number of languages ; i don 't know how many but arabic is one of them , they have a special interpreter for them .
they even have a mosque here at t - - - hospital for prayer % eh . most of the patients that come to us are from saudi arabia , lebanon , syria , egypt , almost all arab countries .
a cause for pride is that the huge building in which the hospital and the md anderson research center are located is named after albert alkek , a wealthy american of lebanese origin who was a great philanthropist who donated money to american hospitals , this center among them .
this of course is a source of pride for the community in general and the staff , patients , researchers and doctors especially .
dr. nour sneige again -
at the md anderson here where i work there are many doctors of arab origin .
and - - - their reputation is very good and they r - - - i mean , represent many arab countries .
% eh , and it is a very good thing , makes us always feel proud that his name stayed on the building .
- and they always get , i mean
donations % eh from the family , from his daughter , from his wife , continuously .
is there anything , would you say , that links these arab doctors together so that they are more active in areas other than their medical field ?
there is the - - - % eh society - the arab medical society , % eh and it eh % has a branch here in houston .
- - and a number of its branches
the main branch is in los angeles .
and it has lots of activities . % eh % eh
- the latest activity
almost every year they do activities in an arab country
% eh they give research they gi - - - visit hospitals .
the latest activity was in lebanon .
about 1600 of them came to - % eh - came to lebanon .
all the time % eh b - % eh there are invitations and they come and there is an exchange % eh of doctors and research between arab countries and here .
dr. nour took me on a tour around her ward at the md anderson cancer center .
and through the microscope i saw cells that looked to me like a surrealistic painting of beautiful purples and pinks of all shades .
dr. nour explained to me that this was a sample of cells collected through a very modern method known as - % foreign for testing and diagnosing cancers .
it is used instead of biopsy , which is considered a surgical operation during which the patient is anesthetized and which takes a long time to produce results .
i will let dr. nour sneige talk about this innovative method in her own words .
there is another way % ah here in pathology that we do , and it is % foreign we learned it from - - - from sweden and it is very widespread now in america , it is testing with a needle called an aspirator .
it has a thin needle such as for extracting blood but % eh we extract % eh cells from the - % eh tumor and study them under the - % eh - microscope at the same time .
and we can decide within five minutes whether they are tumor cells or healthy cells .
and this has % eh replaced biopsy in - - - 90 % of the cases .
of course it is more comfortable for the patient and gives faster results .
the patient is very happy , especially when the cells are healthy , and we tell him right away that what - - what the situation is , because and even in the malignant cases - because the patient is often scared - % eh doesn 't know what the problem is and - - - and i mean wants to know instead of having to worry .
and be put under % eh full % eh anesthetic and when they take the needle and the -
no , no . right , as if one was taking % eh bio - - - % eh blood , like drawing blood .
the patient stays conscious and does not need any - anything and does not even feel pain
often no , there is no need to give him local % eh anesthetic because it is just like the prick of a needle . % mhm
this means it , this kind , can 't be done in all hospitals .
% eh , this kind of test is only in large hospitals and needs specialist training .
at this time we have a special year , people come and train % eh
i mean , after they finish their medical degree , if they want to train in this field % eh , there is a year of training .
it is very , very % eh very % eh widespread and desirable because doctors like very much to know what the result is , the - % eh - what the diagnosis is and on this basis treat the case .
with this , dear listeners , we have come to the end of today 's episode of the arabs in america program .
until we meet again at the same time next week , farewell from me , maha al-halabi rabie . until next time .

king abdullah , the jordanian monarch , and yasser arafat have called for an israeli - palestinian - american committee to be set up to investigate the clashes .
after a closed session in amman , the two leaders expressed their support for an urgent arab summit to be held to discuss the middle eastern issues .
however , they did not mention when the summit would be held .
mr. arafat thanked king abdullah for opening up jordanian hospitals to victims of the israeli - palestinian clashes .
on the other hand , the french news agency said that jordanian opposition groups had called on the government to cut relations with israel .
it reported a statement made by opposition leaders and muslim - led professional unions saying that the israeli embassy in amman should be closed .
the statement also called on the government to issue a condemnation of what it describes as the massacre of palestinian civilians by israel .
it published an article by its jerusalem correspondent , tracy wilkinson , about the horrifying incident which millions of viewers in the arab world and abroad witnessed in which israeli soldiers fired at palestinian father jamal durra and his 12 - year - old son rami .
the correspondent said that this image , captured on camera by a television cameraman working for a foreign news agency , had caused disgust and shock in palestinian and israeli circles equally .
meanwhile , fighting in the west bank and gaza continued on sunday for the fourth day running and resulted in more palestinians being wounded .
the correspondent quoted major - general yamtaz simia , commander of the israeli forces in the southern region including gaza , as saying that the two victims were among a group throwing stones and firebombs and that israeli forces were being shot at by palestinians just a few meters away from where the father and son were .
however , the correspondent reported jamal durra , the father of the dead boy , as saying that they had been on their way back from a car store and that he was watching the israeli soldier who then took aim and fired at them directly .
the los angeles times correspondent ended by saying that the palestinians are accusing the israelis of committing war crimes
and using palestinian radio to broadcast messages in hebrew targeting palestinian soldiers and telling them to " stop and think for a moment : what you are going to tell your children when you kill children of their age . "
tens of thousands of iranians demonstrated in tehran in protest against israeli - palestinian acts of violence .
a state - supported demonstration was organized today .
the chairman of iran 's consultative assembly , mehdi karoubi , held israel responsible for the breakout of violence .
he condemned the killing of about 70 people , most of whom were palestinians .
khaled mashaal , the leader of the political wing of the palestinian islamic resistance movement hamas , made a speech to the public in which he said that palestine could only be liberated through jihad .
he praised the iranian supreme leader , ayatollah ali khamenei , who called on the islamic world to start a jihad against israel .
demonstrators burned the israeli and american flags and chanted slogans against the palestinian leader yasser arafat , chanting repeatedly that palestine can not be liberated by compromise .
in syria , the ruling baath party newspaper likened the acts of the israeli security forces to acts committed by the nazis .
today , as an increasing number of arab countries express their solidarity with iraq , in spite of the severe sanctions imposed by the united nations , a plane arrived in baghdad from the united arab emirates carrying medical supplies and a delegation of doctors , nurses , journalists and government officials .
the delegation was headed by the health minister , mohamed al-madfa .
algeria intends to send a plane to iraq later today .
earlier this week , planes arrived from morocco and before that from yemen and jordan after they obtained the approval of the international sanctions committee .
he said that what sharon did in jerusalem had complicated matters for the peace process .
this was said in a joint press conference held with the american secretary of state madeleine albright .
our cairo correspondent , nermeen mahmoud , followed the conference and brings us the details .
at the start of the press conference held on thursday afternoon in sharm el - sheikh , the american secretary of state madeleine albright expressed her regret over the bloodshed in recent days in the palestinian territories .
she went on to say , " i would like to offer my condolences to the families of all those who have lost loved ones .
this cannot be the future of the region for the israelis and palestinians . "
she added that talks were held the night before aimed at reconciling the events of recent days in order to allow there to be other interim phases to deal with the psychological aspects for those who are working towards peace .
mrs. albright added this was not an easy matter .
that barak and president arafat made it clear that they were committed to making progress towards ending this tragedy .
she said that president arafat and ehud barak had agreed to end the violence and maintain a peaceful course and would issue orders to put an end to this .
the issues have to be clear and firm on the ground .
madeleine albright replied to a question concerning what had been done in terms of the united states ' main objective of mediating between the two sides in order to protect children .
so has this objective been achieved ?
mrs. albright said , " i think america is making every effort it can to ensure calm returns to the region .
yesterday , i held in - depth talks and the main element in these talks was to invite the two sides to reduce violence in the region .
i believe that today 's events demonstrate that there has been a move in this direction . "
mrs. albright went on to say that she hopes this continues and that she would like to see less violence in the region .
but america is a reliable negotiator and a trusted mediator and will continue to play this role .
albright believes there is a unique opportunity that must be pursued .
this is according to what she said .
in reply to a question about what egypt is actually doing to push the peace process forward , egyptian foreign minister amr musa said , " we should be angry about what we have seen on our television screens .
children are being killed and civilians are being shot in their own homes .
this is something we cannot accept and peace must be just .
amr musa went on to say that the peace process is in need of a suitable environment because the situation is contaminated and that is why we have worked towards creating the air of an investigative committee so that the world can rest assured that such measures have greatly disappointed us .
in her reply to the question of whether any ideas had been put forward to the american side , especially in the aftermath of the recent tensions following sharon 's visit to the al-aqsa mosque , mrs. albright said , " we have been given some ideas from the egyptian side and we will discuss these ideas , along with the other ideas put forward .
we will all work over the coming days to reach a way to put a stop to this matter .
i think the important point here is that we need to focus on what is actually happening on the ground and to make sure that the commitments undertaken by both sides yesterday are abided . "
in reply to a question about why the israeli prime minister barak had not attended the sharm el - sheikh meetings , the egyptian foreign minister amr musa said , " when president mubarak invited israeli prime minister barak to take part in the sharm el - sheikh meetings , he was aiming to help the peace process and bring all the sides together and be the main sponsor in an effort to advance the peace process , especially in the aftermath of the tensions the region has witnessed . "
mr. musa said that communication will continue .
he added that barak might not have come to egypt because he knows there is a position that must be acted on and that real steps have to be taken towards achieving it .
perhaps this is what prevented him from attending .

more than 140 american indian activists were arrested as they protested against a parade held yesterday in denver city in the state of colorado on columbus day .
police said most of them were arrested for assault and loitering .
on monday , the united states celebrates columbus day to honor the italian christopher columbus who is considered the discoverer of america .
however , american indians consider him a slave trader who committed genocide against their ancestors .
the clashes between american indians and italian americans during the parade in denver city on columbus day in 1991 led to the commemoration being canceled for the rest of the nineties .
we first asked her what is new in the situation , particularly after israel threatened to intensify its military position .
she said , " today , things looked like they were heading towards a promise to negotiate the release of prisoners from israeli prisons , lebanese to be precise of whom there are 16 , in return for three israeli soldiers who were captured after they carried out an operation on saturday in the shabaa farms region .
israeli warnings which began on a very stern note on saturday afternoon created a curfew - like atmosphere and fear in lebanon amongst the people especially as sunday is a holiday .
there is a state of fear and people stayed at home . many projects have been postponed , especially as this was accompanied by israeli fighter planes breaching lebanese airspace
and breaking the sound barrier over the capital , beirut .
they flew over baalbek and up to the northern region of tripoli , as well as over southern and mountainous areas .
in response , israel reinforced its military positions on the border with lebanon and sent large reinforcements after three of its soldiers were captured .
the israeli army sealed off the shabaa farms area where the israeli soldiers were captured and a commando unit
took up position in the northern area where a state of alert was announced after the kidnapping of israeli soldiers .
at the same time , clashes continued as palestinian refugees demonstrated along the border area .
they threw stones at israeli soldiers and the israelis retaliated by firing rounds of ammunition and smoke bombs .
this resulted in palestinians being wounded . they received first aid on the ground .
concerning the return of the three israeli prisoners , have negotiations started yet ?
negotiations are taking place between the lebanese government and hezbollah , on the one hand , and israel , on the other hand , mediated by the head of the international red cross committee 's delegation to lebanon , harry varney , who held talks with prime minister salim al-hasr and hezbollah 's representative .
mr. varney said after his meeting with hezbollah 's representative , wafeeq safwat , that he was positive about meeting hezbollah .
he was given a letter from the israeli authorities about the three israeli soldiers captured yesterday .
he said it asked hezbollah to let the red cross see the three prisoners .
however , he declined to answer or to clarify hezbollah 's reply , especially as hezbollah 's secretary - general , hassan nasrullah , had said in a live television interview that hezbollah would not give any information about the three prisoners without something in return .
he said the israeli prisoners were in a place beyond israel 's reach .
he talked about a diplomatic channel to mediate the issue of the captured soldiers and said that this channel " has been opened with hezbollah and that these soldiers were not captured for fun but because there are lebanese prisoners in israeli prisons .
we want to work towards their release . "
at the same time , there was maneuvering in the united nations . the leadership of the international emergency forces in the south held an emergency meeting attended by the united nations special envoy ral snowton , the commander - in - chief of the international emergency forces , general owen , and the international forces ' policy advisor miguel where recent developments were discussed .
the united nations special envoy is scheduled to hold meetings with lebanese officials .
have lebanese officials issued a formal reaction with regard to the threats made yesterday by the israeli prime minister ehud barak which he reiterated today in northern israel ?
the clearest reaction came today from president emile lahoud who said that israel was responsible for the recent escalation on the lebanese border
and that it must take sole responsibility for any reaction it may take against lebanon .
president lahoud said that lebanon rejects threats motivated by less - than - serious methods of dealing with the problem that has arisen .
he stated that this state of affairs would not have happened had israel cooperated with united nations efforts and the calls made last may and had it released kidnapped lebanese citizens from israeli jails .
he said lebanon sees israel 's latest threats as a transparent attempt to evade the issue both politically and militarily .
he said that lebanon refuses to constantly be an outlet for israel 's internal crises or a piece of paper used by israeli officials to improve their situation when faced with difficulties .
nabih beri , the parliamentary leader , held israel solely responsible for the safety of its soldiers , rather than lebanon or syria .
otherwise , how come there were soldiers on land not belonging to them and among a people that israel has subjugated , killed , made homeless and threatened .
najia al-hosari , voice of america correspondent in beirut , thank you for this telephone conversation .
israeli prime minister ehud barak said after extending the deadline he set by 48 hours that he was giving the palestinian leader yasser arafat a few more days to get the violence under control .
however , president arafat referred to the israeli decision with derision .
he said the israelis were issuing warning after warning .
he said the appeals made to israel by world leaders is what made them make this decision .
more than 90 people , the majority of them palestinians , were killed in the fighting which lasted 12 days between israeli soldiers and palestinian protestors .
clashes are still continuing in some places .
a palestinian boy was seriously injured by israeli fire today in the gaza strip .
palestinian stone throwers clashed with israeli soldiers in ramallah in the west bank .
however , it looks like the clashes are less widespread than yesterday when fighting between jews and arabs in israel broke out in a number of israeli towns .
the united nations secretary - general kofi annan said he believes there is an opportunity to stop the bloodshed .
he made this statement after his meeting with arafat in gaza and prime minister barak in jerusalem .
president clinton is contributing to the current diplomatic efforts to end the violence .
he intends to contact barak and arafat again by telephone .
a white house spokesman said holding a israeli - palestinian summit is one of the options being looked into at present .
however , there are other options too and american officials will also be in contact with the united nations secretary - general in order to obtain a report of his efforts for peace .
this request came during a joint press conference with the united nations secretary - general kofi annan .
mr. barak said israel holds lebanon and syria responsible for finding a quick solution to this situation .
he added that the kidnapping of the three soldiers is a violation of international law following israel 's withdrawal from lebanon .
israel threatened reprisals against lebanon and syria unless the state makes efforts to end hezbollah 's activities .
the capture of the three israeli soldiers is the most serious confrontation to date between israel and hezbollah
since the withdrawal of israeli forces from southern lebanon last may after two decades of occupation .
our second news hour will begin shortly .
this is washington and the time is now 2pm , 9pm eastern mediterranean time .
ladies and gentlemen , may god 's peace and blessings be upon you .
now for your weekly date with the america program which today discusses the bloody confrontation between palestinians and israeli forces .
will this confrontation lead to the collapse of the peace process or a return to support for the negotiations ?
we bring you this session after a quick review of the main headlines in this news summary .
israel has postponed the deadline it set to retaliate forcefully to the palestinian demonstrations .
israeli prime minister ehud barak said after the 48 hour deadline has passed
the american secretary of state talks about the situation reaching crisis point today in the middle east and gulf region .
in this section as well , arab , european and russian reactions to the situation which is deteriorating again between the palestinian authority and the israeli government .
we move on now to a review of today 's most important news .
israeli helicopters fire missiles at targets in ramallah .
there has been a fall in share prices and an increase in petrol prices on the world markets because of developments in the middle east situation .
an explosion on an american navy ship in aden harbor results in the deaths of at least four sailors and the wounding of several others .
president clinton orders the majority of the economic sanctions on yugoslavia to be lifted .
the united states says president clinton is to visit north korea before he leaves power .
the russian news agency says a car bomb in the chechen capital grozny has killed 15 people .
we go now to moscow to our correspondent evgeny sivradod to talk about what the moscow government has decided to do concerning the current developments .
after a heated debate , the international affairs committee at the duma in the russian parliament issued a statement concerning developments in the situation in the palestinian territories . it holds israeli right - wing forces responsible for the current confrontation in the middle east .
the draft statement , to be discussed at friday 's parliamentary session , also includes a call to the two sides in the dispute to avoid taking any steps that could lead to an escalation of tensions later on .
the senators also praised the mediation work foreign minister igor ivanov is carrying out in order to convince the palestinian and israeli leadership to start a dialogue and to revive the faltering peace process .
commenting on the agreements that have been reached concerning the tripartite summit , minister vladimir rutin , the duma deputy chairman , said that russia had made every effort it could to resume the middle east settlement negotiations .
lutin , who previously held the post of russia 's ambassador to washington , expressed his regret that the tripartite summit is to be held without russia 's participation and at the same time stated that the peace talks might have been successful had they been held along the lines of the madrid meeting , given that russia and the united states are sponsors of the peace process .
some observers believe that russia 's position would have been more effective were it not for the forthcoming american elections which makes the kremlin wary of any movement on the middle east crisis front that might anger washington as this would have a negative impact on future relations between russia and the united states .
in the latest statement about the israeli bombing of ramallah and the gaza strip , duma chairman gilbadi vlosnov , said yasser arafat and israeli prime minister ehud barak must take urgent measures , including inviting their people to abandon the use of violence and find a political solution .

to aids , with herbs and deep fountains of hope

to aids , with herbs and deep fountains of hope
serious experiments continue to be carried out by devoted people to confront the malicious fiend , aids which indiscriminately attacks both rich and poor . these experiments are deemed to stay in the shadow for many reasons , such as the lack of media support , but mainly because of the lack of work privileges under genuine sponsorship . at the same time , the word on the street is about the case of one man who has overcome his illness with the help of his sheer will and his constant research for new and unconventional methods to strengthen his immune system against the disease .
this happened to many therapists in africa , one of whom went to the extent of declaring that he was ready to inject himself with infected blood to prove that he could treat himself .
what is happening in africa is just the same as what is happening in our countries , except with more difficulties , as we only have doctors who practice conventional methods to fight this disease . on the other hand , they will suffer criticism from the media and various governments or let 's say the arab world . the latter is compelled by medical and vocational unions to fight against these unconventional medical practice trends , or the so - called " alternative medicine " that mostly relies on herbs .
negative public opinion towards herbal medicine is fuelled by both official and unofficial media channels . other than that , it is supported by those who falsely claim to be professional therapists , who back up their argument using bad cases ; these therapists are widely dispersed due to the mixture of those who are capable and those who aren 't in light of the absence of a real desire to embrace those who are truly serious herbal therapists .
apart from that , a bigger obstacle faces aids patients in all societies , even more so in arab society , which is that those patients cannot declare their illness in public .
not only that , but they are also not willing to support therapists trying to prove how efficient the medications are . if you succeed , you won 't find them supporting you , so all of those patients stipulate that their cases should stay confidential , even after the therapy is over .
all these issues are related to honor and dignity . although people are aware of various ways in which they can be affected with the virus , such as blood transfers and so on , people still believe what the hadith says : " at times of misfortune , cover up is the best solution . " what follows below is based on 5 true cases i witnessed over a two year period .
i realize i am obliged to go on with my experiment despite obstacles that have been mentioned previously . it 's unfair to know all these dreadful details about the disease , and not be able to do anything about it even though you know of the potential benefits of herbal medicine .
the aids virus was transferred from monkeys just like its succedent , bird flu , which was transferred from pigs .
the real impediment in treating aids comes from its ability to disguise itself , especially in later stages . one of its creative methods of deceitfulness is to hide itself within human tissue . it is also known to everyone how the virus chooses the immune system to launch its attack on .
based on those facts , i developed my strategy to attack the virus based on two different approaches . firstly , the constant change of my weapons , herbs , which i used to alter every now and then .
since i was acquainted with the nominated herbs for these kind of experiments , i had enough substitutes that enabled me to maintain this approach .
the second approach was to help develop the immune system , along with studying its roles and behaviors . i used the same types of herbs to put this approach into practice .
the patients ' desire to be healed was another factor that helped me with my work for all 5 cases , and most importantly , the trust those patients put in me in accordance with confidentiality was the biggest cause for success .
to summarize all , i am not claiming to be the only therapist with a magic wand that could win us couple of rounds in our fight . yet the success i 've achieved should not be overlooked . of the 5 cases i treated three were cured . as for the two others , one stopped contacting me after one month of treatment for no known reason . and the final case showed no progress for reasons i cannot comprehend .

the war is over in iraq , and rumsfeld concedes defeat .
in a unique press conference , broadcast moments ago on cnn television , rumsfeld admitted that the american forces had lost the war in iraq . rumsfeld stated : " the only hope for america is if the arab league succeeds in its initiative in convincing the iraqi people to abandon the resistance , and to get involved in the political process established by the occupier . "
rumsfeld went on , in answer to a journalist 's question about when he would know whether his plan to close in on the insurgents had succeeded :
" we will not know the success of the plan until the december 15 elections and the formation of the next iraqi government . if the iraqi people agree to take part in the elections and accept the legitimacy of the government to come , only then will we have succeeded . "
this admission comes after zelmay khalil zadeh , the american ambassador in iraq , stated that his country was seeking contact with a number of insurgents ( see details on the aljazeera website ) . this american ambassador , from afghani background , made an unconcealed attempt to crack the resistance line - up and participated in rumsfeld 's plan while informing the iraqi people that the insurgency had joined the political game and hence admitted the legitimacy of the occupation .
the defeatist declarations come amid the increasing anger of the american public towards bush and his criminal strategy in iraq . in denver , colorado , furious demonstrators surrounded the president 's media bus containing the team commissioned to cover his movements , preventing it from going on its way . the crowd swore at and cursed those inside the bus , demanding that they publish the truth , and tell the rest of the world that the american people reject the occupation policy , and request the return of their men from iraq .

which resulted from discussions and reviews of the information and analysis of situations of the iraqi political arena , in association with the tragic events , in cities and towns , which cannot be separated from the whole political process in the country , denying and rejecting terrorist actions against our people , carried out by the occupation forces and the departments ' forces of both defense and the interior and religious groups , who label others as infidels .
the vast majority of participants in the symposium tended to believe that a boycott , coinciding with popular and mass activities enacted by the national forces against the occupation ,
best represents the rejection of the draft of the constitution , which aims to legalize the partition of iraq ,
the effacement of its arab identity , and a waste of its natural resources , creating discord .
in the meantime , a minority of the participants decided to reject the poll by saying ' no ' to the draft .
the majority has endorsed a boycott , after taking into consideration :
first : the insistence of the occupation to have its aims passed .
first : the insistence of the occupation to have its aims passed , for the sake of which iraq was occupied , which is a breach of all international laws and regulations .
second : the draft of the constitution is subject to the poll and the pressure is on the american administration to legitimize it within a specific time to fulfill the aim of that administration and to reject the aim of the iraqi people .
third : the results of the committee 's work on the draft of the constitution included the committee of ( 15 ) , confirming racial and sectarian bases .
fourth : the draft of the constitution was written directly by american and british interference , and it didn 't respect the adjustment base , which requires the agreement of all representative parties in the committee of the constitution enactment , which revealed a clear legal violation ,
and ensured a drift towards the aim behind the american occupation of iraq , which is declared by recognition for the draft of the constitution printed inside the american embassy , relating to the policy of awakening interest and terrorism , denying the adjustment base , which they established and then rejected .
fifth : the national assembly didn 't vote on the final date , due to a shortage in its legal staff which leads to breaching the administration state 's law ,
and this requires a declaration of disengaging the national assembly because of its failure to confirm the draft and to call the poll under article 61 of the state administration law , which stipulates the necessity of disengaging the national committee , in case of an incomplete writing of the constitution on 8 / 15 / 2005 or failure to request an extension till 8 / 1 / 2005 .
what happened came as a contrast to all prospects , the national assembly resorted to an amendment to the state law an hour before the time it was due , which is another big breach to the article text ( 3 / a ) , which confirms the legislation over two stages , a primary reading and a secondary reading in a regular meeting , and at least two days will separate them and it 's impossible to ensure that voting only comes after at least 4 days and is listed in the agenda according to article ( 32 / c ) .
the participants took into account some facts , such as :
1 . the impossibility of international observers attending during the poll .
2 . the occupying authority and the ruling parties won 't accept a national legal inspection which is represented by iraqi law .
3 . in spite of pointing to two or more breaches and contraventions by the united nations to the last elections ,
these remarks weren 't taken into consideration nor did they invalidate the results of some ruling parties .
this is except for military operations performed by the occupation forces and the interior and defense department forces in different iraqi areas and their effects which prevent people from taking part in the poll .
thus , the participants in this symposium don 't feel any hope in achieving a fair and honest poll , in spite of media calls for which are allocated tens of millions of dollars .
they deployed a high level of technology and technical experience for it , from specialized international companies .
so the participants in the symposium will go to the forces , commissions , political and religious parties , national figures , the educated , artists and writers , journalists , vocational organizations to organize a poll and to stand together against dividing iraq , the effacement of its arab identity and the waste of its natural resources , and to prevent establishing a legal and constitutional climate for civil war .

festivities in saudi arabia .
festivities in saudi arabia .
more than twenty local chocolate manufacturers and fifty foreign exporters are looking to polarize the 1.5 billion riyals that saudis spend on 600 tons of chocolate to celebrate bairam . the festival starts on the last day of the holy month of ramadan and runs until the third day of bairam , when the demand for chocolate increases by more than 40 % .
specialists who work in the sector expect an average annual increase of 15 % , while estimations indicate that the size of the chocolate market in saudi arabia is estimated at about 400 million riyals when compared to annual imports . the local production share is about 20 - 30 % , a production capacity of about 250 tons , while the annual demand exceeds 40,000 tons . the increments of return on investment , which hit 20 % , is enhancing the attraction for investment in the chocolate industry .
the individual consumption of chocolate increases whenever the standard of living rises in society ; the average consumption of chocolate for each person in saudi arabia is about 2.7 kg of chocolate per annum .
market observers believe that the market is ready to receive more investors , following an increase in both demand and the average saudi income . the average reception of new investors in the saudi market is increasing successfully in comparison to other markets ' size and population .
the price of a kilogram of chocolate varies according to the quality of the chocolate and its contents ; the price of one kilogram of first - rate , or what is called prestigious chocolate , hits 350 riyals . other grades of chocolate range from 150 riyals per kilogram to a minimum of 60 riyals , again dependng on the quality .
some market workers say that they are noticing an increased rush on such days as this , especially among women , who are usually the decision makers when it comes to the purchase of food to celebrate bairam . men too , considering their wives , children and guests , usually want to choose the best , as offering chocolate has become a tradition which cannot be ignored during the bairam celebrations . the minimum amount that one family buys during bairam is estimated to be no less than three kilograms of chocolate .
on a related topic , a practical scientific study done on 300 women has indicated that women who ate chocolate daily during pregnancy had more active and joyful children with more confidence than those of mothers who did not eat chocolate during pregnacy . this could indicate that the ingredients of chocolate have a direct influence on the formulation of a child 's general mood .
in many nations , chocolate is considered one of the most important gifts on festive occasions , due to its widespread association with love and such delicate sentiments .
a scientific study has shown that chocolate contains more than 300 natural stimulants , including caffeine and theoromine , which increase nerve - transmitter activities , in addition to some chemicals related to improving moods and increasing feelings of relaxation .
researchers have found a strong connection between eating chocolate and emotional force . it has been shown that women who eat more chocolate enjoy a romantic and emotional life full of love and passion as opposed to others . in addition , it 's good for the heart , improving its ability to pump blood .
the swiss are world leaders in chocolate consumption , consuming an average of 27.7 pounds per person , and annual sales are worth more than 90 billion dollars , they are closely followed by the germans , with 22.3 pounds , and the americans with 10 pounds .
the swiss ' proficiency in the chocolate industry dates back to the year 1819 , when francois - louis cailler inaugurated his chocolate factory near geneva lake . at that time , chocolate was fragile , harsh and bitter .
in 1867 , the first piece of milk chocolate was produced .
the real breakthrough came in 1897 when the idea of adding cocoa butter came to rudolf lindt . this softened the consistency of the chocolate , and caused it to melt in the mouth .
some people who work in the chocolate industry recommend keeping the chocolate in the mouth until it melts , and spreading it slowly on the tongue , in order to get complete enjoyment .
and they also say that good chocolate melts like butter ; it should not stick to the palate .

" fleeing days " is what i last wrote .
this story is very long , but i have summarized it as best i could .
the original is composed of three long chapters , and i hope that my summary includes all of its meanings .
the story talks about a girl from al-mansoura whose name is noora , the only daughter to her separated parents .
she is a secretary in a private company . she is active and loves life .
she enjoyed the best situation a person ever could ever wish for when home was normal ; a working father , a tender mother , and peaceful surroundings . it lasted until the mysterious circumstances of her parents ' separation , after which she moved to another valley .
the poor 18 year - old girl 's story begins with her search for another homeland . she starts a journey of suffering , in search of a living at a time when values , principles and morals are lost . she finds the true image of life . what keeps her mind busy and eases her suffering is ahmed abdel rahman , one who migrated to canada three years ago . he loves her immensely , and she too loves him .
in the course of events , she is confronted with a terrible surprise . ahmed abdel rahman , the handsome young man , died , and consequently all lovely things ended .
the father marries a girl ten years younger than he , while the mother marries a married man .
the girl lives alone , looking for a homeland .
she quits her job and starts thinking about running away from her wrecked home , yearning to see another world and start her journey alone .
on a sunny spring day , she heads towards the train station in al-mansoura , that beautiful city , carrying in her suitcase the sorrows of a terrible past .
as the train departs the station , she sheds gentle tears and heaves sighs . she continues the tears until the beginning of the end .
the train arrives in cairo where life is chaotic , the streets are cramped , and everyone walks alone . no face , among the many there , is familiar .
she books in at the station hotel for two days , and starts a trip to the suburbs of cairo .
she thinks about working , for her money is about to run out .
she works as a sales agent in a big company . she receives commissions . she rents a room in a popular suburb .
she works hard during the days and sleeps nights as a type of escape .
she is honestly enthusiastic and ambitious . she saves some money in a short while out of her commission . she is true , loyal , and very active in her work . eventually she rents a shop and starts getting clients to sell computers .
she grows famous among students and computer engineers .
she is only reminded of her past life by the occasional call to her mother and father .
it has been two years since she left home . she has all but forgotten her past life , but there is a profound sadness inside her which she jealously keeps to herself .
she becomes heartless and swears she will love nothing but her work .
days pass quickly , and she remembers that she needs a partner in life to compensate for the bitter days , to provide her with lost tenderness .
she gets to know a young engineer , one of the clients who admires her greatly .
dear reader , i will stop here , but will continue the story later . now i am very tired , i am dying to sleep , and my eyes are very red .

american researchers achieve record internet speed .
researchers from a center affiliated with stanford university have affirmed that they have discovered a method to send data via the internet 3500 times faster than current communication systems allow .
according to the scientists , this technological breakthrough has registered a record figure in internet speed difficult for current computers to match , and may open the road for scholars to exchange and store huge amounts of data around the globe .
a group of the center 's scholars , in cooperation with scientists from the institute of technology in california , holland 's nekhis institute and amsterdam university , managed to send the equivalent of four hours of dvd movies over a distance of seven thousand miles in less than a minute . the data was sent via light conducting material from sunnyfield in california to amsterdam via chicago , at a rate of 923 megabytes a second for 58 seconds .
leis kotriel , assistant manager of computer srevices in the research center affiliated with stanford university , said that the methods used in the experiment could be applied to the internet within the next year or two for the use of those scientists involved in microphysics . he added that , as he has said on a previous occasion , the way we handle the study of sciences these days and the methods we use to execute tasks will probably change in a radical way , especially in the ability of scientists to co - perate without needing to leave their homes .
scientists are still conducting experiments in an attempt to achieve even higher speeds of data transfer . the cost of the experiments has reached 2.2 million dollars , which might indicate that firms would support the expenditure required to use the internet at its full capacity , even though its ability might well exceed their needs .

hacking of microsoft software codes .
microsoft , the largest computer software producer , says that some hackers have infiltrated its network . "
it is believed that these hackers have infiltrated the original windows operating system designs produced by the company , the operating systems used by around 90 % of personal computers around the world . "
the organization 's abuse of its market position , and monopoly of the market , and its continuous refusal to share its computer coded software with others , resulted in an immense controversy with bitter legal battles with the american authorities . "
after the last attack , it turned out that the original codes were stolen which is a dangerous situation for microsoft . "
serious consequences .
what 's more , the hackers might have had the opportunity to tamper with original codes , which may cause difficulties for users who buy these software codes , which were tampered with . "
up until now , microsoft hasn 't said much about this attack , but it declared that lately they have discovered that one of the hackers managed to penetrate their network . "
microsoft is now trying to confront the problem , and to make sure that its network is highly secured , "
and assures that all its software codes are still secure .
that doesn 't mean it ’ s impossible for hackers to access these codes , but according to investigations conducted so far , they believe that the hackers couldn 't tamper with the software codes . "
network penetration .
while microsoft 's silence is understandable , some details were leaked to the wall street journal in new york . "
according to the journal , some employees discovered the network hacking last wednesday . this happened when they identified some authentic passwords were being sent via emails to some shared email account in st . petersburg , russia . "
further investigations showed that these passwords were used to copy some software codes .
microsoft says " " we have transferred the case to the fbi " " . "

patrol officers of the holy mecca area have arrested an ethiopian woman practising quackery in the mashrafa suburb in jeddah during their sudden attack on the suburb .
the lady amna %pw or as her people would call her ( the empress ) was of ethiopian nationality , aged thirty - five , and she spent most of her life practising magic and jugglery .
she was arrested last friday at her apartment , number 6 on the ground floor , in the mashrafa suburb in jeddah in one of the residential complexes . she was weeping profusely as she was surprised seeing the investigators from the local passport adminstration during the attack at the apartment , which resulted in her arrest . even her people preparing magic and talismans couldn 't save her nor help her to realize that the investigators were coming to arrest her .
" alriyadh " met the " empress " who stated that she 's lived in the area for two years , has moved from one area to another and settled in the current area in jeddah city , saying she has practised magic and jugglery on her people and on those who came for a minor hajj pilgrimage . she would meet people in her house only after identifying them or meet with whoever set an appointment through her secretary or her business director %pw who arranges her appointments . every customer has no more than fifteen minutes and the cost of every session is five hundred riyals per person .
she added that she performed lots of magic and talismans for grooms and brides amongst her people by a special incense , which she called alkawa ; a substance whose source and shape are unknown but which resolves every bride 's problem .
she pointed out that she didn 't expect to be arrested at this point in time , since she considered that the best day of the week and the summer season was approaching ; many of her people asked her and she admitted that she carried out twelve operations to wed some of her people in an illegal manner .
she was finally arrested and handed over to the migrant administration in jeddah for deportation to her country .

( the education department ) pays ramadan salaries without increases .
abdallah obeid allah al-ghamedy - awad al-shatila ( riyadh )
the department of education issued an instruction to all divisions of the department , which rules that work will cease during proceedings of the holy month of ramadan but employees ' salaries will rise for the month of ramadan . the salary will increase in relation to previous salaries but without increasing upon the generous royal decree , which accounts for ( 15 % ) .
it seems that the department 's continuing payment of salaries to its employees according to the old system comes as a result of the details and mechanisms for applying the raise , decreed in the royal decree , not arriving , and it is expected that the ramadan salary increase will be back paid in the months following ramadan .
it 's worth mentioning that the employees of the department of education exceed ( 450,000 ) male and female employees .

a saudi woman has appealed to the family of a man she killed defending her honor to save her from execution .
_ _ _ _ _
a 20 year - old saudi woman who has been on death row for six years has appealed to the family of the man she killed to pardon her .
the story that rocked the aseer area is back : the girl who was married and giving birth , and loved her household , her husband and her children , and who was threatened by the disclosure of a secret from her past in having had an innocent love affair with a young man .
according to saudi newspaper al-watan , the girl had begged the man to leave her alone but it was useless .
she decided to get rid of her past . her house was the scene of the crime ; overwhelmed by anger , she killed him , in defense of her husband 's honor and her own , with the available weapon , which was a bird hunting rifle .
the past lay dead in front of her eyes .
now the lady in her twenties is paying for the lovely life she found upon marriage , awaiting punishment .
but she has strong faith .
and all those who deal with her in jail state that she has memorized the qur ' an and teaches it to the other prisoners .
and she well knows that there is someone to forgive and pardon for the sake of god .
the lady ( s ) considers her case is punishment from god :
" i 'm still appealing to the officials to consider me as one of their daughters ,
and i appeal to the victim 's family to forgive me and to obtain his reward ,
and i swear to them that i tried to avoid this as far as i could , but it was hopeless .
in spite of that , i 'm sorry for what has happened ,
and appeal to those who have mercy to find reconciliation and to support me with my troubles , for god 's sake . "
s says : " i never imagined myself to be a murderer one day .
if i could turn back time , to that moment at which i lost control of myself , i wouldn 't do such a thing . i would go to the police to solve my problem . but i was surprised by the situation , and i defended myself and my honor .
any other saudi woman would have acted in the same manner .
i begged the man whom i killed to leave me alone , but it was useless .
at that time i had been married for two years , and loved my husband , and i dreamed of having a settled life like all girls ,
and having children , doing my best at teaching them .
but what happened has destroyed my dreams . "
s mentions her husband 's noble attitude towards her :
" i have great respect for my husband , and i appreciate his attitude and faith in my case .
what i did was to maintain his honor while he was away . "
she dried tears when she recalled her father 's death , who had a stroke a few months after she was jailed :
" my father used to visit me and support me , and he advised me to be patient and careful , but he passed away and left me alone . "
of her time in prison she said : " i spend most of my time praying and reading the qur ' an .
there is no free time in my day , i keep on praying at night , and read as much as i can of the qur ' an .
the inspectors and the social worker do their best to remove any feelings of concern or stress that i might have . "
she added : " i have been kept away from my family 's love , but god gave me the love of the prison 's officials , who treat me as if i were their daughter .
they encouraged me to join sessions for qur ' an memorizing in prison , and i managed during these years to learn it by heart , as well as study doctrine and learn the prophet 's hadith .
i came to teach it to the prisoners and to be a guide for them .
i 've learned a lot in prison , from many stories that i heard and knowing the prisoners so well .
and these stories have made me closer to god , and gave me more experience in life . "
and she added : " i have endless faith in god .
my hope in obtaining forgiveness of the family of the victim is great . i feel sorry for their loss ,
but i appeal to them to set me free from the situation i am in , and to forgive me , and to consider me their daughter , who has no support or hope except from god . "
to her family she says : " i appreciate your support , your encouragement , and i want this support very badly , for i 'm your good daughter who needs your prayers . pray for me , mother . "
she advises girls to have faith in god , and to follow his instructions in the holy book , and be afraid of sin in secret and in public .
the supervisor at abha prison , naela aseery , has confirmed what s has said : " s is now an adult and a religious person . she regrets what she did , repents to god , and she does her best to teach the prisoners socially and religiously , especially now that she has memorized the qur ' an , and obtained a deep knowledge of sharia law . many of the prisoners are eager to attend the religious sessions she conducts .

afghan writer miral maaroof depicts in her novel " widow camp " the era of cultural conflict in afghanistan during the last period of the shah 's reign before the russian war .
the writer excels in her portrayal of the intellectual conflict the country passed through during that period when islamic trends , demanding the adherence to islamic core values and qur ' anic ethics , conflicted with the secular trends , which demanded of people to leap over these core values .
she specifies in the chapters of her novel various aspects of the afghan cultural reality during that period .
just imagine , in such a poor and miserable country , there were those who demanded that women go out in american jeans , and thought of the islamic hijab as an indication of backwardness and ignorance .
regardless of the end of the novel , where the writer glorifies the victory of the islamic trend at the beginning of the soviet war , its importance lies in the fact that it tackles an unknown cultural reality in that period .
what is most astonishing is that the outdated reality is strikingly similar to the current saudi arabian cultural reality , in which there has been much conflict between islamic , secular , and liberal trends , in addition to other trends that cause less commotion .
what is different is that at the end of the book , the afghani people were miserable , but the end for the saudi cultural conflict is still unseeable , and no person , of any ideological persuasion , would want to see an end similar to that of afghanistan .
beginning with sheikh mohammed bin abdel - wahab 's movement and his alliance with ibn saoud , right through to the first , second and third saudi states , the modern islamic trend has been in existence , but had not taken real cultural significance until recent years . sheikh mohammed 's movement was a call to return to pure monotheism , and to eliminate elements of polytheism and ignorance . the pioneers of the islamic movement majored in matters of sharia , jurisprudence , the pillars of religion , and they paid much attention to religious studies .
cultural idioms , such as islamic literature and all its branches , did not appear until recent years . this might be due to the literate cultures that invaded islamic countries and the cultural exchange that ensued .
the cultural conflict came to a head between religious and modernist trends , dominating some media outlets , mainly printed media . at that time , adherents of the islamic movement violently attacked modern trends , their advocates , and ideologies , none of which have been all that clear .
they used the many popular religious platforms to confront modern trends ,
and they succeeded in reaching the masses , notably with the support of abdel aziz bin baz , the prominent , respected , knowledgeable scholar , when he wrote an introduction to awadh al-qarny 's book , entitled " modernity in the scales of islam " .
the conflict ended with the collapse of modern thought , and its advocates abandoning its teachings after admitting that they could not change the principles of a society .
the end of modernity coincided with the rise of the secular movement , which seemed more organized , and enjoyed wide media coverage .
the secular movement seemed clearer about its goals , which called for the separation of religion and state .
the clarity of this secular goal helped islamic adherents to alienate it from the public so effectively that some saudi regions received the anti - secularist writings before the pro - secularist ones were even written by their advocates .
this swift attack on secularism , combined with the inclination of some secularists to attack some islamic core values taken for granted by saudi people , has formed a base of hatred and calls to boycott secular thoughts , be they audio , visual or printed . sometimes , this hatred has resulted in death threats against secular advocates .
but the islamic movement received a blow from the government in 1994 when its pioneers were imprisoned and stripped of their academic and oratorical posts , despite the ambiguity of reasons given for the arrests . they were kept away from the intellectual arena until their return four years ago . but the secular movement did not take much of that on board , and have not been active . it seems that the base of hatred formed by the islamic movement has been very influential in limiting their activities .
the secularists were more able to occupy media and publishing posts due to the inactivity of the islamic movement and its adherents in the domain of the mainstream media . in addition , the secularists put up certain barriers to prevent the islamists from publishing their thoughts . nonetheless , the secularists could not publish with publishing houses that were subject to the censorship of the government .
what the censors ' eyes did miss was often caught by the islamic movement , whose basic goals conform with the constitution of the state . the islamist scholars enjoy a high level of respect and influence on political figures .
after september 11 , and the resulting events in saudi arabia and much of the world , and the political authority 's inclination to adopt policies of dialogue and reformist thinking , secularists , the new liberals , waged a fierce attack on all things islamic , like summer camps , the " commanding good deeds and prohibiting evil " squad , and even went so far as to target certain names and certain regions , considering it the settlement of old scores .
the islamic movement , receiving a severe blow from those who perpetrated acts of terrorism , rushed to declare their non - affiliation via audio , visual and printed media outlets . it initiated drastic media action in response to current affairs and the demands of the masses , and eventually surmounted this obstacle , but the secularists were still the most forceful in their dealings .
the islamic movement achieved success in the municipal elections , the first conducted in saudi arabia , and its advocates swept up all the municipal seats in the country . that was a severe blow to the opponents , the " sons of secularism " , as the islamists like to call them , and confirmed that the islamic movement was the dominant trend amongst the lettered elite of saudi arabia , despite the low turnout at the elections . the success led to feelings of satisfaction and confidence for the islamists , and was a blow to the other movements .
islam is the strongest word in the islamists ' agenda . the secularists realized this , and gradually abandoned the term secularism in favor of liberalism , attempted to formulate a tolerance of islam that did not contradict their general goals , and concentrated on what suited them most about islam while ignoring the rest . they pitched their ideology at the public , hiding behind slogans of reform and public interest , and maintaining significant relations that were compatible with the policies of the saudi authorities .
the emergence of reality tv and mass voting competitions proved that the majority of the saudi population was indifferent to , and basically uninterested in , cultural issues . the populace 's religious adherence was either weak , fragmented or malleable .
while the secularists / liberals busied themselves with founding a new islam that suited their goals , the islamists themselves were active in targeting this sect and countering it fiercely . this tells us that the islamic movement will ultimately win this round , and will make no apologies to its opponents , the " sons of secularism " .

in egypt prostitution under the cover of marriage offices
in cairo city , giza and alexandria , there has been an outbreak , in recent months , of investing companies , whose primary activity is restricted to solicit marriage or ) join two people legitimately - according to the egyptian idiom - their headquarters are stationed in elite suburbs such as mohandeseen , agouza and dokki , and it turned out that this secures high returns , which lure others into this activity , which enjoys a legitimate status .
yet an investigative field report carried out by crime bulletin , a publication affiliated with akhbar al-youm , that is the biggest of governmental journalistic insititutions , draws the conclusion that such companies market only illusions as they provide no civilized alternative for marriage seekers .
it is assumed according to those companies ' aims , upon which they obtained their lawful licenses , that their role is exclusively to provide an application form in exchange for a few pounds , for marriage seekers , be they men or women , to fill in , then they leave , never to show up again , only with a promise to receive another call from the company 's office with news when they find a life partner for them .
yet the bulletin 's correspondent - according to what he published - found himself faced with offices , the accurate description of which is offices that facilitate fornication and prostitution .
for example , one office or company in alexandria 's most prestigious street , is a villa that houses not a single man but the prettiest women , where a marriage seeker pays egp 200 , then the girl or lady of his choice arrives - even if she is the company owner , who enjoys exceptional beauty , only to offer to accompany the man outside the company , allegedly to get acquainted , then she ask of the man to rent a furnished apartment for the purpose of spending some time .
interesting advertizements to guarantee the immediate availability of the required girl .
thus , egypt is bedevilled with multiple companies claiming their ability to arrange marriages between young men and women against all odds . moreover , as the crimes bulletin states , there is one company , which was swamped by a great crowd and a great human flow from both genders , and so has decided to establish two branches , while another is claiming to be the biggest center facilitating marriage in egypt and the middle east .
the crimes bulletin infiltrated this mysterious world , embarking on the journey with all its provocation and surprises , to blow the whistle afterwards , yet it adhered to singling out companies or centers that are really playing the very role of matchmaker .
multiple billboards for marriage seekers are to be read everywhere in the three governorates , cairo , giza and alexandria , as if those companies have become the sole medium of marriage in this century . . .
one of those signs read : surprise . . the biggest and most famous marriage office in the world . . . we cater for all ranks and ages . . . we help you to immediately meet a suitable life partner , no matter what your circumstances or age .
indeed they are exciting words , newspaper advertizements which are sometimes paid for .
here we present a question . . . do these offices actually conduct those services , or are they merely an obscure cover for other activities they perform , surrounded by stealth and circles of mystery ?
the fellow journalist who penned the article decided to embark on the experiment himself , and become one of those who seek to get married in order to unveil this vague world , so he contacted one of those offices , only to be greeted by a delicate feminine voice ; he inquired of her about the address claiming to be in need of fulfilling his religious requirement to wed .
she inquired about his phone number , then provided him with the detailed address .
in a few hours he headed to the stated address , where he read a sign on which was inscribed ( marriage seekers company ) , which was in effect a small apartment .
the seretary received him with a suspicious glance .
he tried not to attract her attention much .
she asked him to have a seat in another room in the apartment , where he found men and women displaying facial gestures of acute despair , and a look of amazement was immediately expressed in their eyes the moment they saw him .
they consisted of the over forty age group , one of them asked about the effectiveness of this office .
he answered in total calmness . . . " who are you and what brought you here ? "
he said : " i want to get married " . . . the other replied : " but you are young and your appearance is good ; why should you come here ? . "
he answered : " i have certain attributes that i could not find in any girl i 've met so far , and i hope to find her in this office . "
at this moment the secertary pitched in and asked him : " have you come to search for somebody ? "
he answered her that he was searching for a wife , at which she requested of him to wait .
moments later , there appeared a man with a very revered outlook and requested that the man accompany him to his office , then he learnt from him that he is the office manager ,
in a direct way he asked him : " are you a journalist ? "
the colleague continues to add : " i adhered to my calm , and asked him : " why ? "
he replied : " because you will not need our services . " i instantly answered him : " are there conditions for marriage seekers ? "
he replied : " that they have no other goal , because we are a respectable company , not like other companies . "
i sensed at this moment that i achieved my goal , with him directly admitting the existence of other companies that engage in wrongful activities utilizing propaganda to cover up what they do ,
i managed to obtain some of those companies ' names from him , after i completed a form listing the attributes i wish for in my prospective partner ; of course , i deliberately wrote descriptions impossible to find in a human .
on the next day i headed to a newly established company in nasr city , where surprises start to unfold . "
a photo album of girls .
in a luxurious villa on the most prestigious street of nasr city in cairo , a security guard stands at the gate , the journalist inquired of him about the person responsible for receiving marriage requests ,
following a brief chat he delved into the villa only to find secretarial staff who received him with smiles , then one of them requested his id card and asked him to wait a little while ,
after which she brought an application form and requested of him egp 50 as a registration fee in that office ,
: and we let him narrate the rest of the details afterwards .
" i was shocked to find her presenting me with a collection of pictures of pretty girls , i kept examining the pictures closely a score of times , until i set my eye on one of them , then i pointed it out to the secretary .
. . . she once more requested of me to wait
this time i waited more than half an hour , after which i was shocked to find the girl whose picture i selected present in font of me in flesh and blood . . .
this surprise came as an immense shock , as i felt i was delving into a supermarket or a take away restaurant .
we headed together to the villa 's garden , which bears a striking resemblance to the fish park , and we start to get aquainted face to face .
this girl is 22 years old , a graduate of the college of fine arts , living with one of her friends in al-maadi district , because both her parents are working in the gulf states . . .
during my dialogue with her i came to learn that she has no intention of getting married to any one , that she is using this office as a medium of introducing her to men , and she informed me of the existence of a company for marriage seekers in alexandria , while in fact it 's a place of promoting dissipation and pursual of depravity . "
no place for a cop or a journalist .
our colleague grabbed the chance , he traveled to alexandria the next day . headed for the mentioned address , climbed the stairs of the entrance to the highrise in which the company exists ,
there , a series of mind - blowing events began to unfold , as there was nobody in this office save a single secretary receiving clients , i . e . those seeking a partner in life ,
he knew that he must pay a registration fee to this office before any procedure takes place with one condition , that the applicant must not be a policeman , a journalist or any person working in the judiciary system , these conditions called for suspicion .
says he : " when i inquired of the secretary why the registration , as i approached them to get married not to join a sports club , i learned from her , via indirect implications in her wording , that this registration provides me with more than a lady or girl to choose from . "
after paying the fee , i determined the description of the girl i want ; at that moment i became sure i was in a house that facilitates immoral practices .
i requested of her to see the office mananger as i will be their regular client , having really admired their " super lux treatment " . . . i was met by a lady in her mid thirties , she asked me once more about the attributes of the girl i want , but she did not mention , not even once , marriage in all her speech , as if i am approaching some nightclub .
" the manager is ready and at your service . "
we reached a point when this lady offered her sexual favors indirectly , when she told me that she is not married and at my service , whereupon i apologized to her and stated some other attributes ; within 10 minutes my request arrived , hot and fresh .
a 26 year old girl . the manager told me she will return in half an hour to discuss the details , and left after she smiled at me in a devilish way , while restating the marriage details of course . . . " don 't get me wrong . " then she left us and dashed out of the room . the girl began to ask me about my personal details , all of which concern finance .
she told me : " we will go out to dine at a famous restaurant " , then she left me asking me to wait till she informed the manager .
following her disappearance , the manager returned with a winning smile on her face and said to me : " what do you think of this girl ? " i told her i will go out with her then i will judge ;
i reqested of her to bring some other girls so i can freely choose , and see if i favor one of them .
a few minutes passed , then she brought me some pictures of girls then left the office , i made use of this chance and copied some of pictures on my mobile phone , then i returned the pictures where they belong so the mananger would not notice a thing .
the manager admits the office facilitates prostitution
a few more minutes passed and the manager returned with the girl , with whom i left to go to a nearby restaurant , where we exchanged words during which i came to know the most minute details and secrets of these offices .
the girl began her talk saying : " the story started when i went with a friend of mine to a marriage office in cairo , as i 'd passed the age of thirty and not found mr right , there i met the manager who tried to break the ice with me telling me she has a job for me , enticing me with the high returns , and she began to explain the details of the job which is to go to alexandria to work as a secretary in an office for marriage seekers .
i agreed to the job , especially with the high return she promised me .
the work was normally carried out at the beginning , where i used to receive fees of applications from marriage seekers , but i noticed some of the girls wearing revealing clothes entering the manager 's room , then some men enter and every man leaves with a girl .
i tried to know the secret from her , but she told me to wait until the right time .
after few months i was surprised by her calling me into her office , because she wanted to talk with me about an important matter , then came the shock and the speedy fall .
the girl continued her talk to the journalist in all frankness and sorrow : " the manager told me : " you are very pretty , yet you don 't know how to make use of your beauty . "
this was the first sentence she told me at the beginning of her talk with me and when i inquired of her about the reason for that she told me everything . for the office i work for is nothing but a cover - up to facilitate immoral activities .
at first , she offered me the work , but i refused this offer and after considering it for a while , i agreed on one condition that i determine the details of the meeting with no interference on her part , and to receive a percentage of the income she secures from this work .
the manager immediately agreed as she knew her own profit was very high . . . and what encouraged me further is the fragmentation i experienced in my family , my parents separation and my own failed love story , so i had nothing to cry over . "
a wild night in a furnished apartment .
here our colleague at the crime bulletin says : " at this point , she refrained from talking and requested of me to leave the place and go to a furnished apartment in alexandria to spend some time there , but i requested of her to postpone this wild night as i was committed to an important appointment .
" the story ended at this point . i became absolutely certain of what some of these companies do , taking marriage as a cover for soliciting such crimes , yet this is not to say there are no companies which provide a serious opportunity to select a lifetime partner in a civilized and venerable way . still , how can a marriage seeker , utilizing this method , be sure of this ?

brigadier fahed al-bisher , the general manager of the public traffic department affirmed that throwing rubbish and spitting on streets is punishable by law with a monetary fine of a maximum of 300 riyals and a minimum of 100 riyals .
al-bisher said that fining the driver who throws rubbish from cars is not new , but was part of regulations 35 years ago . however , it will be more actively enforced to control this behavior , indicating that city municipalities have also been instructed to cooperate with the traffic authority in fining people who throw rubbish and cigarette butts .

a swiss analyst : the west mistreated muslims twice
geneva - tamir abu al-ainain - islamonline . net / 06 / 26 / 2005 .
arnold hottinger ( 80 ) , the conspicuous swiss journalist , and the middle eastern affairs specialist said that the west have mistreated islam and muslims . this is due to centuries of shallow misunderstanding of the religion and for considering it as the gigantic creepy neighbor . this resulted in catastrophic outcomes for both the arab and islamic worlds .
those accusations were reported in a series of lectures being presented by the veteran journalist , who spent 50 years in the middle east region as a reporter for the thurgauer zeitung conservative newspaper . the lectures were recited by him during a full study day designated by the paulos academy on 06 / 25 / 2005 in zurich , switzerland , to talks about the middle east and the islamic world .
mr. hottinger , who speaks arabic and is familiar with islamic affairs , said that islam is like a crucible that holds various races and various cultures . this is the reason why muslims with various ideological and racial beliefs agree on definite principles , and that 's exactly what the western society can 't envisage or understand .
superficiality and solid ideologies .
in his lecture , mr. hottinger considered that the main reason for this western islamic fear is due to the superficial approach in dealing with this issue and misunderstanding of the religion . he pointed out that the early orientalists and church officials didn 't quite transmit anything about islam other than warfare , and that is typically what was copied later on in educational books and guides misleading the western world to view islam as the giant fierce neighbor , and this is an atrocious abuse to islam .
hottinger added , " not a single western school textbook has denoted how islam spread in asia , although most muslims are located in asia , and when islamic migrants came to europe , all those misleading stereotypes were already firmly established in western society .
he also noted that the superficiality adopted by western society in dealing with muslims is a fact even though the west is the actual cause of many arab and islamic disasters . "
the swiss journalist also reviewed the history of occupation in arab countries and the succession of europians in dissembling the ottoman succession , and how this led to enormous border and racial based disagreements that the arabic and islamic worlds suffer to this very day .
the academy that hosted the lectures , paulos , is a christian based academy involved in carrying out regular conferences about islam to enrich public opinion about different aspects , be it regarding muslims in switzerland or the arab and islamic worlds in general . the islamic bodies union , zurich , also participate in arranging some of those conferences .
a huge mistake .
the prominent swiss journalist mentioned the turkish - europian portfolio as well . he considers the eu rejection of turkish emergence will be a big mistake .
voters in france and the netherlands already voted out the unified european constitution in may 's elections in 2005 . political spectators have reasoned that this is a result of the voters ' rejection of the idea of turkey joining the eu . turkey is supposed to start its official eu emergence negotiations in october of 2005 .
mr. hottinger stated that rejecting turkey would affect many sides . firstly , this will assure islamists that western society will not want any kind of close relationship with islam . secondly , this indicates that they want europe as a christian continent with no place for muslims whatsoever . these outcomes and more will not result in any kind of closeness between those two sides .
as for turkish internal affairs , these repercussions would be more negative and hence the army would consider those relinquishments it made in order to achieve some convergence with the eu to be useless . this could lead to a turkish democratic reform and cause pm recep tayyip erdogan 's government to deteriorate .
identity wipeout .
hottinger thinks that it 's unlikely for europians to see turkey giving up its religious islamic identity . the turks elected islamists , after the failure of kamal attaturk to wipe out the islamic identity , in accordance with western standards , at the first democratic elections .
hottinger added , " all attempts to vanquish islamic identity have failed " , citing the turkish and the soviet attempts as examples . he added , " after the collapse of the soviet union and its gaining independence , i visited some mid - asian republics . when you asked any ordinary person about his identity , he would tell you that he 's an uzbek muslim . meaning they care to show their religious identity as part of their personality despite all the unsuccessful communist attempts to suppress this identity " .
arnold hottinger is considered to be one of the most acquainted people with arab and islamic affairs for his half a century of field work in the region . he 's also proficient at arabic and persian .
throughout his long stay , he authored many books , such as " the islamic world and the middle east . . . experiences , confrontations and analysis " which was published in 2004 , and there have been 5 editions so far . " the religious country and pyramids of power and democracy in islam world " was published in 2000 along with incalculable analytical articles , lectures and specialized conferences .
accept my best regards .

the president of the bahraini social partnership to oppose violence against women , ghada jamsheer , revealed that the partnership sent letters to a number of women ’ s associations , among them the association of rural girls , in order to further cooperation in increasing awareness in regions where the practice of female circumcision is widespread , especially in the villages .
jamsheer added that the partnership has begun preparing an awareness publication about the negative aspects of %pw custom , and it is scheduled to be distributed next september . she clarified , according to the bahraini al-wasat newspaper that conducted an interview with her today , monday , 7 / 18 / 2005 , that %pw issue is an issue that concerns all civil society institutions , first of which are rights and women ’ s institutions and associations that are involved with the state , all of which should join forces in order to stop the spreading of this custom .
and in a first official reaction toward this custom , which violates women ’ s natural rights , the general secretariat of the higher council of women sent , in a statement it distributed yesterday to the press , that the council has begun discussions with the ministry of health to set up a joint committee to monitor the facts and work on conducting a scientific study with the specialized agencies to determine the extent of the points raised in the annual report of the bahraini association for human rights and what was published in the press .
the statement added that there are other specialized official agencies related to this , given what the preliminary information included published about the age group that is subjected to these practices .
in that statement , it affirmed that the council is following up with interest all that is published daily in the local press and what is being discussed in terms of societal issues , especially as they pertain to women , directly or indirectly , and each issue is referred to the competent authorities to take the necessary steps and suggest the appropriate solutions , according to the operating procedures of the council .
meanwhile , the statement %pw to the continuation of the follow up by the general secretariat directly with the labor minister in order to look into the magnitude of the problems specific to the women workers in the ready - to - wear clothing factories .
the first reactions had come from the al-arabiyah satellite news channel which published on its electronic site on the internet the investigation by al-wasat , which prompted a series of reactions from various parts of the world . several opinions saw that these are wrong individual behaviors that have nothing to do with islam , and they thought they were sickening .
they urged all competent official , civil and religious authorities to clearly intervene to put an end to them , through increasing awareness of the physical and psychological harm that they leave in the woman , and of the negative impact that they cause in the marital relationship .
jamsheer had demanded the necessity to punish the persons who carry out the circumcision operation on girls in bahrain , explaining that this is in violation with the conventions on the rights of children and the forms of discrimination against women that were signed by the government of bahrain , and of the necessity to disseminate awareness through the launch of an organized national awareness campaign with the participation of all authorities , led by the ministry of health and the ministry of education and instruction , in the various regions of the country .
it is noted that the bahraini association for human rights pointed in its report last year to the widespread practice of female circumcision in bahrain , but that it did not meet with any reaction or follow up by any authority , until it was exposed a second time in this year ’ s annual report , which was put out and exposed through the al-wasat newspaper .

saudi women endure great embarrassment from a saudization of lingerie stores
saudi women demand that ladies supervise the sales at such stores
a number of saudi women expressed a feeling of great embarrassment from dealing with male salesmen in lingerie stores after the decision to saudize them .
they point out that the presence of saudi salesmen makes them feel greatly embarrassed as they see in them the image of the father or the brother , but that does not mean that the solution is to keep a man of a foreign nationality to do the sales .
in the course of an investigation conducted by colleague samar al-muqran and published by the saudi newspaper al-watan today , monday , 5 / 23 / 2005 , these women felt that these stores are for women ’ s intimate apparel and that men should not be entering , whereas others emphasized the mistake of the saudization of these stores .
these women are demanding that ladies supervise sales in these stores .
recently a trend has begun to open lingerie stores inside the women ’ s malls , but you can count these on one hand .
the labor ministry had recently stopped issuing work visas and licenses to stores selling women ’ s necessities with the goal of saudizing this sector .
hussat al-hussein says that the presence of a man , of whatever race , in these stores that specialize in women ’ s intimate apparel is an undesirable thing , whether he is saudi or foreign .
for her part , manayer al-suhaybani sees that the problem they face as saudi women is in the congestion experienced by stores supervised by ladies . for many times , not all sizes are available , in addition to the fact that the availability of two or three stores in which women are the salespersons in the whole region of riyadh cannot be considered a solution .
al-suhaybani recommends to the big stores that contain various corners for women ’ s and children ’ s clothes , to close off the women ’ s clothing corner so that only women can enter it , provided it stays at the same place in the same store , according to the store ’ s own regulation .
amina ali says , “ when i go to buy underwear , i look like a criminal because i buy the items quickly without looking at them , and i try to hurry to pay the amount in order to leave the store as fast as possible .
amina does not think that there is a big difference between a saudi salesman and a salesman of another nationality . but she says that the matter becomes more embarrassing with the saudi salesman .
ameera al-dubyan has resorted to another means to overcome this problem as she undertakes to buy her necessities in that area during her summer vacation outside the country , because , by her own account , saudi arabia seems to be the only country where men work at its women ’ s stores .
and this lady believes that the presence of a male salesman in these places contradicts the basic customs and traditions to which we hold firm .

doctors at the sheikh zayed hospital in nouakchott succeeded in performing a complex surgical operation on a mauritanian boy that resulted in converting him into a girl after 20 months of masculinity .
the boy had been suffering for a period from pain because of dysuria , and he was transferred between several hospitals in mauritania before he finally came to rest in the beds of the children ’ s section at sheikh zayed hospital in nouakchott .
after conducting the necessary medical examinations , x - rays showed the presence of an abnormal lump below the bladder . so the doctors decided first to perform a surgical operation to reach that lump and find out whether it was a malignant or benign tumor .
as the doctors began the operation , they were shocked by a surprise . for that abnormal body was none other than a complete female genital system beginning with a uterus and the two ovaries , and ending with all the external components of a woman ’ s genital system .
the surprise forced the doctors to stop from completing the surgery and inform the father of the fact of the situation , whereby the doctor convinced him of the inevitability , and that they were waiting for his permission to convert his male child into a female .
the father answered , “ do what you think is appropriate ” .

how the higher administration confronts its own negligence to the sons of our colleagues who died today on al-shuayba road :
reliable sources reported the death of two of the beloved nation ’ s sons this morning on its precious soil on the road leading to the electric power plant in al-shuayba as they went to work .
the negligence of the higher administration in providing appropriate housing for them in that region comes despite the existence of pilgrims buildings , as the people of mecca ( may god honor it ) who work at al-shuayba call it , which are so scarce as not to be enough to house 10 % of those who work there . in addition , the residents there suffer from the pollutants of the station and the ships offloading fuel there .
i remembered the request by one of the employees to the chief executive officer of the company , mr. sulayman bin abdullah al-qadi , and i think he is from public relations at gharbiyah , proposing a project to provide appropriate housing for the employees and pushing it on the workbench with one of the non - usurious banks with easier terms and smaller commissions , and and and and etc .
today , when we have lost colleagues ( and how many have we lost ) , they are the best of the sons of the nation and the company , and they are the best prepared , did we not think of their sons and how their situation will be ? and do we wait until one of the vice - presidents or even the board of directors dies on the same or any other road for us to move in that humane direction , which above all is in the best interests of the business , the stability of the employee and his family , and therefore , itself .

after that , the two infant girls were completely separated , by god ’ s will .
as to the sixth phase , which is the phase of separating the bone of the sternum , the ribs and the posterior part of the abdominal wall ,
after finishing with connecting the gall bladder duct with the intestines for alaa ’ , the medical team began separating the bone of the sternum and the other side of the abdominal wall ,
and in the seventh phase , the two twins were separated and the team was divided ,
whereby alaa ’ and walaa ’ were successfully separated , praise god , and each one of them was placed in a separate surgical bed .
the following phase is the procedure of closing up the area of the surgery
at that , the team was divided into two parts , one for each twin and they proceeded to suture the wounds .
as for the eighth phase , which is the phase of bandaging and transferring to the intensive care unit for newborns , is the last phase , during which the team began closing the area of the surgery .
afterwards , dr. abdullah al-rabi ’ ah announced the success of the operation of separating the twins .

perhaps you are wondering about the title
i will here speak about a tested , constant fact ; i will not use the language of low - income employees but rather with the language of businessmen and the language of international investment market dealers . however , from the perspective of various international forces , from the perspective of the international market .
you will perhaps be surprised by what i say , but experience is the best proof .
an easy method that will increase your salary and your income , and will make you a wealthy person , an owner of buildings , houses , real estate and property .
you are still waiting … i wish this would be published in every forum so it reaches everyone , and that every one of them tells me that he will forward it to 10 others at least , or that he will forward it to other forums where this topic was not submitted .
and for information , the greater the number you collect , the greater your percentage ! ! !
yes , the method is a marketing method
the more you market , the more you gain . . . and it is 100 % legally permitted if it done within the terms , and it is fun and easy , and from very , perhaps with a very small capital .
please take this issue seriously , and i ask every one of you to wish me success with this proposed idea . you want it , don ’ t you ?
here is the secret that i promised you . .
the secret with which you win millions and land and property
brothers , the secret is not difficult . we all know it . i tried it and others tried it . and it is not testing god , but trust in the promise of god .
for god , all glory and majesty to him , when he says something in the qur ’ an … it is a promise from him almighty .
( ( god does not break a promise ) )
i am sure you are waiting impatiently for that magical secret
the secret is in god almighty ’ s words : “ saying , ask forgiveness from your lord , for he is forgiving ; he sends rain onto you in abundance ; provide you with wealth and sons , and he bestows on you gardens and rivers ” , surat nuh .
if you ask forgiveness of god , you would have known that you have a lord who forgives sin and takes away sin , so you feared and asked forgiveness
and he promised you , and his promise is the truth . he said : ask forgiveness my worshippers , and i will forgive you . and with your asking of forgiveness , i will send rain to you in abundance so you can quench your thirst and the thirst of your animals , and he who loves money i will provide him money , and not only money , he who loves sons , i will provide him sons , and not only sons , he who loves land , property , farms , gardens and real estate , all of this is linked to seeking forgiveness .
do you see , our beloved , how is the value of asking forgiveness ? ?
did you believe when i wrote the title ? ?
or am i exaggerating ! !
we are not done yet , for there is an important matter too ! !
would you like to market this and get for your marketing a fee and more fee
here is my experience and it is the strange secret :
we do not say this secret in every sermon , lecture , session , or meeting . and the inquirer is asking and complaining of the tightness of the hand , and then he awaits a truth , from god the blessings , and he never delays a single day .
yes , i tried this , and god is not tested , for i was trusting in god , and on the same day , he brought me blessings
well the matter needs marketing – in today ’ s lingo – that is , a call to something god loves , which is asking forgiveness . so much that a friend of mine told me that he is in a marriage , and sometimes things are tight for him , so i told him about the secret companionship – call it what you will -
and after a period of time , he surprised me with the result . he says : what kind of medicine did you give me ?
i said : what medicine ?
he said : asking forgiveness !
i said : and how was it with you ? i was certain of his answer .
he said : honestly , one time , things got tight on me and i needed a sum of money … i recalled your words … and i started asking forgiveness and indeed , on the same day , there was the sum of money that i needed arriving to me from one of the brothers .
i said to him : excellent . if your trust in god is to that point , so distribute your experience among your loved ones and friends , and you will see goodness and fair blessings with every distribution .
therefore , brothers , the matter is easy
distribute it in the forums , among friends , among loved ones , and the non - moslems will see it as a magical medicine for legitimate blessings , and maybe they will join islam because of it , and your worth will rise with your god .
and there is another matter associated with the blessings : “ and for those who fear god , he prepares a way out , and he provides for him from places he never could imagine . ” also surat talaq . avoiding disobedience is one of the things that brings blessings . also obedience to your parents and giving to them , and remember them in the livelihood you subsist on . also favorably thinking about god , and that he is the provider , powerful , and the solid one . and that your blessings are ordained in heaven and will not be given to anyone else but you , and you won ’ t take the blessings of others .
and there are many things for which there is no room to mention
all i wish is that you remember me in your prayer without knowing me , and all those who receive blessings from it , let them write their experience , so that others are encouraged . and let them be truthful in their experience so that it bears its fruits , because some will use deceit to encourage goodness , but they fall into what is prohibited without knowing it , so let them beware .
and god willing , you will be truthful in what you say .

peace be upon you and god ’ s mercy and blessings
a medical study reports that the first cry by the baby may not happen in the birthing room , but rather in the womb .
researchers have been able , by using photos captured by ultrasound and recorded on video , to show that a group of fetuses in the third trimester of life have displayed evidence of crying behavior in response to low level noise that was produced on the mother ’ s belly .
the response of the fetuses came in fear from the noise , accompanied by deep sobbing and sighing , opening the mouth , and a trembling of the chin , all signs of crying .
this behavior , which was observed in 11 fetuses , began in an early period reaching to the 28th week of pregnancy .
dr. ed mitchell from the university of auckland in new zealand said that the coincidence led the researchers to this conclusion , while they were studying the effects of smoking and cocaine use by the mother on the fetus during pregnancy . but upon using ultrasound waves and stimulation by noise in their research , they recognized a fetal behavior similar to the crying of a baby .
and in accordance with this study , the discovery is related to the process of growth , since , in order to cry , the fetus needs not only a capacity for movement but the necessary sensitivity and brain development to handle disturbing noises and recognize them by considering them a negative thing .

riyadh : samar al-muqran
i want to cuddle abeer ; i want to cuddle faysal … i want my family , with successive cries mixed with whoops of pain and sorrow , the voice of a saudi lady living on one of the sidewalks since the beginning of the month of ramadan rises . she awaits the blessed feast of al-fitr on a street in the south of riyadh located behind the ibn qassem auction where foul smells are everywhere and a great sorrow appearing on the life of zein .
a true and realistic scene of a saudi lady living , lying , eating , and sleeping on the sidewalk in the middle of the street among the passers - by in the capital riyadh , and she has no one with her except her infant daughter who has not yet completed her first year of age .
zein ’ s story begins with displacement and misery after her divorce from her husband because of many problems several month ago . she had one baby daughter from him and she has other children from a previous husband who live with their father who forbids her from seeing them .
after her divorce from her husband , she left with her nursing infant daughter and rented an apartment in the al-urayjaa ’ neighborhood . she lived there with her little one , except that her money , which she earned from the end of her service as an investigative commissioner at the al-maathar police , was taken by her divorced husband who disowned her , and it is close to 120,000 riyals , and he disowned her daughter .
zein had previously presented this complaint to the religious court , whereby her divorced husband admitted to it and he pledged to return the sums to her , according to the papers that al-watan holds .
zein spoke to al-watan from the street sidewalk where she has been living for about a month .
she says : i did not have money to pay the rent , so the woman owner of the building evicted me and i sought shelter with the imam of al-hay mosque who promised me he would transfer me to one of the charitable societies . he asked me to quit the apartment immediately because he will help me .
and zein continues : i was happy and he helped me move my furniture and my belongings , and i leased two moving cars , and there were the two cars dumping me and my infant daughter on this sidewalk .
zein interrupts her talk and cries in anguish , “ i want to bathe , i feel my body is dirty , i want to eat , i am hungry
and after she calms down a bit , she speaks in coherent , and sometimes incoherent , sentences , from the horror of the situation she has been living in for a month now ,
she crawls and pulls a suitcase she hides under her bed in the street , and she takes out of the suitcase certificates of gratitude and appreciation in consideration of her participation in national activities , and other diplomas she earned . then she throws them on the ground saying , “ i lost my life , i lost the job , and i lost my children .

researchers at the european space agency have invented a new camera that operates with special rays called t , short for “ terahertz ” , that is capable of photographing a human hand from behind a 15 - millimeter thick paper .
this camera uses waves that are shorter than a millimeter to photograph things located behind a screen or a wall , or a gun concealed within clothes , or it can take photos inside the tail of a space comet .
it can also photograph a wound beneath a bandage without having to remove the bandage .
and this camera invented will cause a revolution in several domains , beginning with space to surveillance systems and finally , to medicine .
the camera that operates with t rays is distinguished by its capability of seeing through certain materials , but it is also possible to focus these rays to obtain a photo .
these rays are considered less harmful than x - rays and it is expected that this camera will be placed on the market within two years , and it is small and can be carried in a purse .

o hanadi , your action is not permitted
dr. mohammad bin moussa al-sharif
praise be to god , lord of the worlds , and prayers and peace upon our master mohammad and upon all his kin and companions ; now :
many people saw hanadi hindi in the paid advertisement in the newspaper al-sharq al-awsat , issue of sunday 5 - 19 - 1426 a . h . corresponding to 6 - 26 - 2005 a . d . , and in the advertisement is shown the photo of hanadi unveiled in a flight uniform ,
and the advertisement mentions that a saudi company signed a contract with her to practice the profession of flying .
by virtue of my specialization in islamic sharia law ( section of the book and the doctrine ) , and by virtue of my work as a airplane pilot who is aware of what is required of workers in this profession , i would like to show the public the following , in clearing my conscience and in advice to the nation : first , this work ( flying ) cannot legally be performed by a woman in this fashion , because she will have to be isolated with men in a closed place , and as soon as a man is secluded with a woman , the devil joins them as the third , and because she will expose herself to temptation because of her constant traveling without a companion , and since there is no necessity that makes such travel compelling for her , she is thus committing an unlawful act .
the third reason that makes this act impermissible is that she that she will wear clothes that reveal her femininity and display that which god has ordered to be covered , and her photo in the advertisement is a clear evidence to anyone with a brain and faith , and this clothing is forbidden by the law and is not permissible .
second , the advertisement stated the following : “ in continuing to support the saudi woman ’ s working in all areas within the teachings of islamic sharia law , the kingdom ’ s holding company congratulates pilot captain hanadi and her two parents . ”
then the advertisement said that the company has signed a contract with hanadi to work in the profession of aviation ,
then it said , “ and congratulations to her two proud parents for her distinguished accomplishment , and may they be honored for their good islamic education and proper upbringing of a young saudi woman of whom we are proud , and we contributed to her achieving her wish within the teachings of our tolerant islamic religion .
“ and from this standpoint , we will contribute and support all saudi young women who desire to be pilot captains according to the teachings of our venerable islamic sharia law ” ( end of advertisement text ) .
i present to you a list of what it contains from among the set of violations of the law : a - this work is absolutely not part of the teachings of islamic sharia law under any circumstance , as i showed in the previous paragraph , and its obvious violation of the teachings of islamic sharia law is too obvious to be hidden from anyone with a handle on their brain or religion , but we live in a time of falsely disguising the truth and not in one manner .
b – the advertisement speaks about hanadi ’ s two parents whom i did not wish to confront were it not to show the truth : “ and congratulations to her two proud parents for her distinguished accomplishment , and may they be honored for their good islamic education and proper upbringing of a young saudi woman of whom we are proud … ”
and i say to those who have turned the facts upside down and who make a mockery of them and us and say that her education is good and islamic , that if that was so , she would not have appeared in her attire that totally contravenes what islam wants of the saudi woman who upholds her religion and her veil , and anything else is entirely undignified .
c - it is not permissible under any circumstance that the word islam appears four times in the advertisement in support of the action of this woman and that to promote it a holy verse is used “ to men is allotted what they earn , and to women is allotted what they earn , ” as well as the noble hadith “ for women are the sisters of men . ”
i say that the mention in the advertisement of islam and its sharia law four times and citing a holy verse and the hadith is never permissible for the following reasons : 1 ) there is support for work over which there is agreement that it is not permissible in this manner in this , and there is concealment from the public in it . and i am afraid that there is in it mockery , since all that anyone who wishes to allow a forbidden action needs to do is to post it in the newspapers accompanied by the mention of islam and the verses of its great book and the hadith of the master of the messengers , may god ’ s prayer and peace be upon him , so it is permissible for the masses and common people .
2 ) it is not honest to cite the verse in this place , since it appears in a context that is in violation of what we are talking about , and it does not refer to the argument of those citing it and their citing it in this place does not benefit them . as to the hadith , yes , women are the sisters of men in rights and obligations and duties , but what the wise legislator forbade us remains an exception to what is generally said in the hadith .
therefore , i call upon the advertising company to quickly apologize to all moslems worldwide and to the saudi people in particular , and to repudiate all that can be attributed to it as accusation of mocking the pure law .
and i now address my words to the sister in god hanadi hindi and i say to her : - be god - fearing , and do not open for our women and our society the door to evil you and we don ’ t need , and do not forget the hadith of the messenger of god , whom god recited to and gave peace , “ and some of the sunna in islam are bad sunna that are burdensome , and those who acted on it were burdened with it till judgment day ” .
so can you , my esteemed sister , bear your burden and the burden of those girls of this pure country who will follow in your steps till judgment day ?
so fear god , and do not sell your hereafter with a small offer from this world , and do not say this is a ignorant fanatical subjugator who does not understand , for i understand the law and , praise to god , i earned the doctorate in sharia law by god ’ s favor and grace , and i am also an airplane pilot who has practiced this profession for a quarter of a century , and i know its concealments and its secrets .
and i said what i said , by god , only out of pity for you and out of fear for this pure country and its women , and to stand up for what is right and to put an end to what is wrong , and god knows best of my position and my intention .
and let not those lights , that puff you up and exaggerate in glorifying what you did , seduce you , for you and i and the experts , all of us know perfectly well that you are just a rookie and that they have done this with you to entice the other women to follow your path and do what you did .
it is imperative that this trick not deceive you and that the spotlight of fame not obscure a very clear truth , which is that your action in this manner is bringing the wrath of god and the curse of people . so why don ’ t you return to your god and courageously declare your repentance , because this is by god a thousand times better for you than an evident violation of sharia law .
and i hold almighty god as my witness that i have done what the scholarly people should do , and i have made my argument to you that this action is prohibited and not permissible .
and i conclude my words to the women of my country by saying : “ beware that you are not fooled by this sweet language and this false fame , and beware of responding favorably to the call for employment and the seduction of studying flying and accessing jobs , because this would be a door for temptation and a dangerous devilish way for the country and its security and safety .
the wise legislator has allowed you women a whole set of jobs which this prohibited work is under no circumstance a part of .
and the purpose behind that advertisement and the exaggeration of hanadi ’ s position is to entice you to do what she did and undertake what she undertook , but beware what the almighty said : “ but it is more fitting that they should please god and his messenger , if they are believers . ” , and the almighty said , “ a male or female believer should not choose concerning a path if god and his messenger have decreed it . ” , and the almighty said , “ and obey god and obey the messenger , if you are believers . ” , so will you heed the call the call of the most compassionate or the enticements of the devil ?
and finally , i say to all those who try to press women into illegitimate work fields to fear god and know that you will account for what you do , the day when money and sons will not be of use , but only those who go to god with a perfect heart .
this is the last of what i have , and if i wanted reform i could not , and the last of our invocations is praise to god , lord of the worlds , and prayer and peace on our faithful prophet mohammad and all his kin and companions ,
and his books
pilot captain mohammad bin moussa al-sharif
note : all my life i never wrote identifying myself as a captain or a doctor , except this time only to show that i have an appropriate connection , almighty god willing , with the science of islamic law and the art of flying , and so no one thinks that i am boastful or conceited , and i ask god to forgive me and have mercy on me .

a shoe that grows along with the child ’ s foot
khaled schmidt – berlin
“ the growth of a child ’ s foot is the growth of his parent ’ s worries ” is a german expression handed down that reflects the displeasure of german families at the excessive rise in the prices of children ’ s shoes , especially since one pair of shoes is used for a short period , after which it is discarded in the trash bin in order to buy news shoes because of the rapid growth of the child ’ s foot .
in order to overcome this problem , a british company specializing in shoes and sports articles on the german market recently offered a new shoe that is considered a first of its kind in the world because it grows with the child ’ s foot , which means a savings for german families of some of their money that they spend on buying new shoes from time to time .
setting size
the sizes of the new shoe – of which large quantities were depleted shortly after it was put on the market for sale - vary between 27 and 37.5 , and is called max the worm because it is shaped like a worm in its mid - section where the size is controlled .
the idea invented for the shoe is based on the presence of a button in the middle of the shoe which , when pressed , causes its extension like the musical instrument , the accordion . this allows the two parents to set it at the right size for their child who wears it for a complete year , after which the size is changed again .
pressing once the button present in the middle of the shoe leads to its extension between one size and three sizes , selecting and setting the most appropriate with a small screen at the bottom of the sole of the shoe .
the important is symmetry
in answer to a question by aljazeera net as to whether the shoe is medically appropriate for children , konrad weissler , of the german shoe institute in offenbach , said that the new shoe does not offer an ideal solution but that it is acceptable from a medical standpoint . he explained that the important is there is symmetry in the middle part by which the size of the shoe is controlled .
for his part , the osteopath dr. berndt kabilka asserted that all the health specifications are available in the max shoe because it combines a sturdy sole and an streamlined external form with , on the inside , comfort , flexibility and sturdiness .

rape of a moroccan girl in a cinematic manner
rape of a moroccan girl in a cinematic manner
a moroccan girl was the subject of a rape in a horrid crime that was almost cinematic in its design and perpetration
the crime occurred at 8:00 pm on a street in the city of salé .
two girls were returning to their neighborhood , and they were surprised by a person standing before them .
he drew a knife and ordered one of them , threatening to kill her , to accompany him if she wanted to remain safe .
she refused to obey , thinking that the traffic circulation in the street will make the criminal refrain from going further with his threat . but she received two strong slaps on her cheek , causing her friend to quickly flee the site , and she remained alone .
the girl engaged him in a conversation to mislead him that she will go with him on condition that he treats her well .
and the attempt achieved the desired objective ,
for he returned the knife to where he had it hidden .
at that point , she took off , running with all the force she could muster towards a popular café ,
asking , with the pace of her troubled tears and panting breath , the café ’ s patrons to rise up and help her against the human monster .
and before the terror - stricken girl finished telling what happened to her , her aggressor burst into the café brandishing his knife .
he asked all the patrons to stay put in their places , or else they would experience things they might not expect .
then he walked up to the fugitive girl and dragged her violently by the hair .
the owner of the café intercepted the attacker asking him to release the girl and return to his good senses , but the answer his received was enough to make him retreat .
and before he walked past the doorstep of the café , a young man joined the site and went straight towards the attacker who was still holding the girl by her hair and brandishing his knife .
he engaged the attacker in a conversation that lasted a few minutes , after which the attacker went away while the gallant young man walked to the girl , assuring her that her ordeals are over and that she won ’ t be harmed .
he asked her to accompany him to his sister ’ s house to rest and calm her fear down , then she re - tidy herself up and her makeup , so that she would completely get over the nightmare of what happened to her .
so the girl found shelter in her rescuer ’ s sister ’ s house .
she threw herself into the nearest chair she found as she was profusely thanking the young man who rescued her .
but she did not know that the worst was yet awaiting her .
for her rescuer , who had removed the mask of manliness and gallantry off his face to reveal his true face , approached her and ordered her to remove her clothes without discussion ,
and he furthered his case by brandishing a knife as if he was playing the role of the first attacker before her ,
then he proceeded to rape her .
not an hour went by that she heard knocks on the door ,
and the guest was the person who tried to attack her on the public street ,
and he had returned according to a scenario he planned with the rapist rescuer who was but an accomplice in weaving the plot .
and the girl found herself deprived of any opportunity to run away or seek help .
the first beast forced her to accompany him to another house , and there he proceeded to rape her all night .
here are some questions looking for answers
now those who rape people ’ s daughters , don ’ t they have families ?
don ’ t they have womenfolk to whom they fear the same thing could happen as they themselves did to people ’ s daughters ?
now when he rapes a weak girl who cannot defend herself because she is a female : does he feel that he is a man ?
now when he rapes a woman , does he find pleasure in this if she refuses him ?
by god , empty minds that satan has controlled .
fw : i ask you to please be careful
fw : i ask you to please be careful
i ask you to please be careful
i ask you to please be careful and be wary of calls that you may receive starting with this number + 22167 for example , which is the code for senegal .
my brothers ! ! ! ! !
these numbers belong to charlatans and liars who will pretend that someone has placed a curse on you , either from your relatives or your family , and that this is black magic that cannot be lifted except by them , and that they got your numbers by supplications and some ridiculous and deceiving evidence .
i was myself the object to such a situation , and i asked the caller to utter the pledge creed in full , but he tried to evade and dodge my request using a few really pitiful arguments such as “ i am a moslem like you and i want good for you ” .
be careful , my brothers , not to fall in their trap , and if it happens and you make a mistake and answered one of their calls , you will find the following :
1 – they speak classical arabic
2 – they deliberately put next to them the voice of reciters of the holy qur ’ an and the call to prayer .
3 – the pretext for calling you is that you fell toto afflict you with black magic
4 – they obtained your number by way of supplications
my personal advice to you
either end the call by hanging up on the caller or answer him that his call is turned on him and that their tricks are exposed to us , the saudi people and all the citizens of the kingdom , and that these ruses are nothing but a quick path for him to enter the fires of hell , in consideration of their lying and their quackery .
the reason for bringing up to you this point of telling them that , is to try to reduce their calls coming to us , to the kingdom and its people and its citizens in general .
do not forget me in your invocations , and this is but a reminder for us not to fall for schemes like these .

al-dammam : mansour al-khamis
a 13 - year old boy serves a prison sentence at the house of observation in al-dammam , after killing his 20 - year old older half - brother in revenge for his mother who had been attacked by his brother who beat and imprisoned her inside the house .
a security source said that the only motive that led the child to commit the crime is repressed hatred against his brother because of what his mother used to endure from him , as he used to continuously attack her and imprison her in one of the rooms of the house . he decided to commit his crime , and seized the occasion of a soccer game , which his brother liked to watch , to offer him to see it at a café .
and before the game was over , he pretended to his brother that he was leaving the café to go with one of his friends , but went instead to his brother ’ s car , which he was able to get in after leaving one door lock unlocked so he can execute his crime . he got in the car and hid behind the driver ’ s seat , making use of his small size . and as soon as his brother got in the car , he stabbed him in the neck with a knife , and when his brother resisted him he proceeded to stab him again in the hand , and finally with a stab that pierced the older brother ’ s chest that killed him immediately .
the child then left the car and went home .
the next day , he went to the police station to report his brother missing and not having returned home . the search for him began and he was found killed , covered with his blood inside the car . the security authorities began the investigation into the circumstances of the incident over which there was much confusion , since it was unexpected that the younger brother would be the killer for several reasons , one being his young age , and also the professionalism with which the operation was carried out to mislead justice .
there was no evidence pointing to the involvement of the child in this crime , but the cunning of the investigators led them to discover the first threads of the crime due to the child ’ s inattention to what he said in the investigation , since he reported that his brother was missing since the afternoon of the day he was killed , even though they went together on the evening of that same day to watch a game in a café . the investigators then began tightening the noose around the child who did not last very long before breaking down and giving his confessions and the motives that made him carry out his crime . he was then placed at the house of observation in al-dammam because of his young age .

important and urgent
important and urgent
first of all , o brothers , by god who created heaven and earth , i wrote this topic only after i ascertained the trustworthiness of the sources and reported the news as it happened .
and i say this in order to prevent those who have mobilized themselves in defense of satan and his party as we find them brandishing their swords before the people of virtue and those who call people to goodness and reform in our good society .
i relate the news to you : one of the brothers who works at the king ’ s hospital at the jeddah harbor that the director of the hospital , dr. sana filimban , may god guide her and return her nicely to him , has been appointed by the former director of health of jeddah , dr. abdullatif al-dereess , to manage the king saud hospital for infectious diseases at the jeddah harbor ( as if hope is all lost for us here in jeddah ) . of course , this doctor wears no veil on her face and is daring . she smokes , such that it got to the point where she smokes in ( ( ) ) , as a friend told me and swore on it . some might say that many women in jeddah smoke and they smoke honey - flavored tobacco , and this is a matter of personal freedom ) , but i am saying that for a woman to publicly smoke , and she ’ s a doctor and a responsible manager , this is considered very bad .
the story began with the female saudi workers who work in the kitchen area and their job is to distribute food to the women patients ’ rooms in the hospital .
these girls have a break room where they sit when there is no work and they perform prayer and so on . this room is made of reflecting glass that does not allow viewing . this was not to hospital manager dr. sana ’ s liking and she ordered that the reflecting glass be replaced with transparent glass . anyone who was not buying could now at leisure look at those poor girls .
the girls did not like this , and so they placed black trash bags and taped them to the glass from the inside , which allowed them to perform the prayer .
and as soon as the news reached her excellency the venerable director , she came herself to that room
and the following dialogue took place :
dr. sana filimban : “ who put the bags ? ”
the girls : “ doctor , we did . if you permit , we put them because people who come and go look at us . ”
the doctor : “ so what ! what will happen if they look , will they see a princess inside ? but you have a rag on your faces . ” she said that laughing .
one of the girls said : “ doctor , this rag , doctor , is a veil . our lord ordained it and the qur ’ an clarifies this , and we are moslems and in the country of islam . ”
the doctor : “ and the qur ’ an and our lord said to put bags . by god , you and the qur ’ an are the cause of our backwardness . ”
of course , she said these words while agitated , and curious people started gathering . she left while telling an egyptian employee affiliated with the gulf supplies company , “ get rid of these calamities or i will get rid of all of you . ”
after all this , the venerable doctor ordered that the girl who was veiled with a sharia veil and who was the cause for her colleagues being veiled to be dismissed . the girls work under the saudization job program in private companies , and they work for the gulf supplies company . the thing that is considered extremely dangerous and no less serious than her cursing about the qur ’ an is her closing of the office of religious enlightenment at the hospital , especially when he learn that the offices of religious enlightenment were opened by order of his excellency the minister of health and under the blessings of the servant of the two noble sanctuaries abdullah bin abdulaziz , may god protect him , back when he was crown prince .
as if this doctor is trying to wipe out anything that is associated with religion , the islamic propagation , modesty , and decency at the hospital .
my brothers , god is witness that this doctor has not had her share of depravity , and this is not slander . rather , this is so that we can all cooperate on the following :
1 – talk to dr. yasser al-ghamedi and denounce what happened . put a competent male doctor to manage this hospital since jeddah health system is full of competent people , praise and power to god , and not allow the westernization of society . in addition , charge a committee with investigating the matter .
2 – talk to his excellency the minister of health at the fax number 014026395 and inform him of what happened . everyone is accountable , and this is a serious matter and it is a crime to be silent over it . and charge a committee with investigating the matter .
3 – talk to his eminence the chief mufti at the fax number 014596943 . 4 – talk to his excellency the under secretary of the ministry of health , dr. al-qasabi at the fax number 4027471 . 5 – talk to the director of religious enlightenment at the ministry of health at the fax number 012801424 . oh god , i have informed your worshippers on the sahat web site . i witness , o god , i witness , o god , i witness . transssssssmitted from sahat .

the stepmother is in the accused box , and the father denies knowing what his daughter endured .
the department of instruction in taef rescues a 6 - year old girl from horrible physical and psychological torture .
the marks of torture are clearly evident on the back of the child rahaf .
al-taef : sa ’ ed al-thubayti
a 6 - year old girl studying in first grade was subjected to savage physical torture that generated violent reactions in education circles and the community of al-taef .
the story emerged in public when the student named rahaf came to school at 7:50 with apparent breakdown and collapse as a result of torture , severe beating and burns on her palms and hands . her teacher noticed that and informed the school director of the matter . the student was examined , and upon removing her clothes , marks of violent beating , physical torture and burns in the extremities and the hands . this caused the director and the teachers to weep at the horrible sight , and the department of education and instruction for girls in the al-taef governorate was notified and a team from the school health unit was called in . the necessary examination was conducted on the girl and it was recommended that she be transported by ambulance to king faysal hospital .
the hospital police proceeded to welcome the girl .
an official report of the event was written , and preliminary information was recorded in preparation of an official investigation in the matter .
meanwhile , a hospital employee submitted an urgent report to the general administration of social protection at the ministry of social affairs explaining the condition of the student , and demanding an intervention to protect her from domestic violence .
at the same time , the student ’ s father was brought in to the hospital where he stated that he knows nothing of his daughter ’ s condition , indicating that he came home late the day before yesterday after she went to sleep . he also mentioned that he took her to school and did not notice any torture or beating traces on her .
a medical source at king faysal hospital indicated that the child has been subjected to severe beating with an instrument to be identified later by the criminal lab , and that that instrument left large marks in all parts of the girl ’ s body and her head . x - rays will be performed to ensure that there are no fractures in the bones or the skull .
the first grade elementary teacher at the school said that the student , who enrolled at the school in the last month of shaaban , was noted to be without care from home as she comes to school hungry and does not pay attention to her lessons and homework , with bruises on the face and around the eyes and burn marks in her body .
the day before yesterday , the student arrived to school with beating marks very clearly apparent on her , and the department of education and instruction was notified of that . and yesterday , the student arrived late to school after morning attendance was taken , and when she entered the classroom signs of exhaustion and beating marks were apparent more severe on her than the previous day . and when her condition was inquired about , she burst out crying and reported that her father ’ s wife beat her and sequestered her in a room when she learned that she had told the school of what she is enduring , and the maid was prevented from giving her food until the next day . and so she came to school in this state .
she also indicated that the director of the administration for student affairs for girls , gharamallah al-zahrani , and upon learning of the girl ’ s ordeal , directed that she be transported to king faysal hospital in the company of the school director , given the psychological stress , nervous breakdown and severe fear she was experiencing .
the director of student affairs for girls burst out crying in the emergency room when he saw the marks of savage torture on the girl ’ s puny body . the general director of education and instruction in the governorate of al-taef , salem bin hilal al-zahrani , also asked that an urgent report be submitted to the al-taef governor , fahd bin abdulaziz bin muammar , to explain the condition in which the student was when she arrived to school and what the school administration has noticed about the student since her enrollment at the school .
sources have told al-watan that the wife , toward whom the fingers of accusation point for the torture of the child , is the father ’ s wife and she is an educator who worked as a director of one of the schools . she currently works outside the department of education and instruction as she was commissioned to work as a member on the dispute resolution committee .
the secrets of the saying “ open your mouth ”
we transfer it
the secrets of the saying “ open your mouth ”
we are ignorant of many things even though they recur before us constantly .
have you ever asked yourself once why do doctors , during our visits to them in the clinic , insist on always asking to open our mouth and stick our tongue out ?
who among us did not hear the saying “ open your mouth ” . certainly no one .
a piece of information i did not know of until recently . as i was sitting in one gathering , the conversation between those present jokingly turned to what everyone did for work and his role in society . the gathering included leaders in various jobs ( officers , engineers , teachers , doctors , businessmen … ) , and each one was bragging about his work and its importance .
in the assembly was a man who was good at jesting and he said , talking to the doctor , you , right now , just the saying “ open your mouth and stick out your tongue . ”
then the doctor changed his seated position and said , “ this is proof of your lack of awareness ; only if you knew the benefits of putting one ’ s tongue out and its significance , you would put your tongue out every minute . ”
at that point
the doctor began elaborating on this fascinating subject . so what did he say ?
focus .
the doctor asks you to put your tongue out during the examination for the following reasons :
for if the color of your tongue leans to the yellow , this would be evidence of the high level of jaundice in the blood .
but if the color of your tongue leans to the blue , this indicates a disease in the heart or respiratory system .
but if the color of the tongue is rosy red , this is an indication of health .
and if the color of the tongue is pale , this indicates the existence of anemia .
and if a layer of white covers the tongue , then this indicates the existence of fever and trouble in digestion .
if there is a quivering of the tongue when it is put out of the mouth , this indicates the presence of poisoning or nervous tension .
so now , all you have to do is go to the mirror , open your mouth , put your tongue out and determine your problem .
may god grant you permanent health , wellness and safety
a tidbit of information i wanted to share for the benefit .
may god grant success to everyone .
with my wishes to all of you that the color of your tongues would be … . rosy red .

bill gates
bill gates , the chairman of microsoft corporation , which is the top company in the world in the software industry , is considered
microsoft achieved revenues that reached $ 35.25 billion for the fiscal year ended june , 2004 ,
and it employs more than 40,000 people in 60 countries .
childhood and studies
gates , who was born on october 28 , 1955 , and his two sisters grew up in the city of seattle .
their father , william h . gates ii , worked as an attorney in seattle .
as to their late mother , mary gates , she worked as an instructor at the university of washington and as president of the united way international organization .
gates attended a public primary school , then the lakeside private school .
in that school , gates discovered his interest for software and began programming computers while he was just 13 years of age .
in 1973 , gates enrolled at harvard university and , while there , gates developed his launch of the programming language basic in the first microcomputers mits altair .
gates dropped out of harvard while he was in his first year to dedicate his energies to microsoft , which is a company he started in 1975 with his childhood friend paul allen , guided by the belief that computers will become a valuable tool on every desk and in every house .
and gates and his friend began developing personal computers .
the expectations that gates had for the future of computers and his personal vision of personal computers had a big role in the success of microsoft and software manufacturing under gates ’ s leadership .
microsoft ’ s mission became the continuous pursuit of advancing and developing software technology and making the use of personal computers more accessible and enjoyable for people .
the company has adopted a long term vision that finds its expression in its investment of more than $ 5 billion in research and development during the current fiscal year .
the most sold book
in 1999 , gates wrote his book “ business @ the speed of thought ” , which is a book that explains how computer technology can eliminate the problems associated with business in novel creative ways .
the book was published in 25 different languages and is available in more than 60 countries .
the book “ business @ the speed of thought ” was widely acclaimed and earned it a spot on the best - selling book list of the new york times , usa today , the wall street journal and amazon . com
gates ’ previous book , “ the road ahead ” , which was published in 1995 topped the best - selling book list of the new york times for seven weeks .
gates donated the revenues from his two books to non - profit organizations that work on encouraging the use of technology in education and skills development .
biological substances
besides his passion for computers and software , gates has an interest for biotechnology
he is the president of icos company that specializes in therapeutics based on proteins and small molecules , and he has invested in several other companies nvolved with biotechnology .
gates is also considered one of the founders of the company corbis that develops one of the largest imaging information resources in the world .
comprehensive digital records for art and photographic imaging from publicly - and privately - owned collections around the world .
in addition , gates has invested in a pioneering company in the field of cellular phones , craig mcgaw at teledesic , which is working on an ambitious project to use hundreds of satellites in low orbits to provide global communications services using bi - directional multi - messages .
interest in philanthropy
philanthropy is also of interest to gates .
he and his wife , melinda , have endowed more than $ 21 billion to a foundation that supports philanthropic initiatives in the areas of health and education throughout the world , with the hope of achieving successes in these areas that are important for all people as we enter into the 21st century .
so far , bill and melinda ’ s foundation has allocated more than $ 2 billion to organizations working in global health , more than $ 500 million to develop educational opportunities , including the gates library initiative to provide computers , internet access and training to public libraries in low - income communities in the united states and canada , more than $ 200 million for community projects in the pacific northwest , and more than $ 29 million for private projects and annual fundraising drives .
bill gates was married to melinda french unexpectedly in january 1994
the couple has two children : a daughter , jennifer katharine gates , born in 1996 , and a son , roy john gates , born in 1999 .
gates is considered an avid reader .
he enjoys playing golf and bridge .
bill gates ’ s fortune
no doubt that many have read the latest reports about the increase in the value of his networth to more than $ 100 billion , then its drop to $ 55 billion .
and he knows definitely how to make ( or lose ) money .
let us contemplate the way bill gates made his money during the past 25 years or so since he founded microsoft in 1975 a . d .
if we assume that he worked since that time 14 hours of every working day of the year , this means that he kept making about $ 1 million an hour , or about $ 300 every second .
this also means that when gates finds or drops a 1,000 dollar bill on the ground while he is going to the office , this amount of money is not worth wasting his time to bend down to pick it up since he can make more than that if he goes straight to his office .
we assume that he will spend about 4 seconds as he bends to pick up the bill and put it in his pocket , and he can naturally hire others to follow him and pick up any 1,000 dollar bills that fall from him .
he won ’ t do any of this because , luckily , he does not think much about his fortune or his time in this fashion .
the rumors are not true that when he received the bill of $ 50 million as the price for a new farm on the washington lake , he simply said , “ melinda , could you bring me my wallet ? i think it is in my other pants . ”
it is also a joke to say that a large section of his house at the farm was built underground with incomparable windows .
to receive $ 45 billion every 12 months is a truly astonishing rate of making money .
this is more than the gross domestic product of chili and egypt , more than double that of guatemala , more than four times the gross domestic product of sri lanka or the dominican republic , more than six times that of costa rica or salvador or panama , more than eight times that of every person in brunei , including the sultan , and more than 23 times the gross domestic product of bermuda .
let alone the companies , not one , not even general motors , exxon , ford , ibm and intel combined earn what bill has earned in 1998 from owning shares in microsoft .
his monthly profits exceeds the overall sales of lockheed - martin , j . c . penney , ups or intel and all but 25 of the other big companies of the 500 richest companies .
in fact , in 2004 , his shares rose to about three times the entire sales , and not just the profits , of microsoft in the year 20
“ the sniper of baghdad passed by here . "
the spirit of the heart
“ the sniper of baghdad passed by here . "
in the name of god most merciful most compassionate
and to begin with , the sequence of terror … the sniper of baghdad passed by here . the almighty said , “ fight them , and god will punish them with your hands , he will cover them with shame and grant you victory over them , and he will heal the chests of a people of believers ” , surat al-tawba , verse 14 .
and the almighty said , “ and slay them wherever you find them , and evict them from where they evicted you ” , surat of al-baqara , verse 191 .
the almighty said , “ fight those who believe neither in god , nor in the day of judgment , nor do they forbid what has been forbidden by god and his messenger , nor judge the religion of truth from those who received the book , until they pay the tribute willingly and subdued ” , surat al-tawba , verse 29 .
god has knowledge of the terror in the hearts of the unbelievers … god has knowledge , you killer , in silence . . . he killed 143 soldiers , five officers and six snipers , and injured 58 others .
the sniper of baghdad is terrorizing the american army and toying with the nerves of its soldiers . one of the iraqi resistance formations broadcast a filmed footage over the web about “ the sniper of baghdad ” , and it says in the tape that the sniper of baghdad has so far killed 143 soldiers , five officers , and six snipers , and injured 58 others .
the tape , which was broadcast by the organization “ the islamic army in iraq ” , shows a number of operations conducted by the sniper , and it appears that the camera was fixed on the sniper ’ s rifle since he likes to document his operations .
the tape shows the confidence and the calmness of this sniper , since he continues filming one of the scenes after he was able to strike down an american soldier who was standing in front of his armored vehicle . iraqi passers - by appear stunned at the fall of one of the soldiers for no reason , and the bewilderment of his colleagues who begin calling on their cell phones .
one of the scenes shows the extent of the terror that strikes the american soldiers after the fall of one of their colleagues , whereby all of them flee to their armored vehicles out of fear that another bullet could hit one of them .
the professional sniper has an amazing capacity for scoring , as the scenes show his ability to hit a soldier with only part of his forefront , his nose and his mouth showing when he strikes him down , even though he is hiding inside the tower of his tank .
the sniper has become famous among the occupation soldiers to the point that one of the newspapers announced a monetary reward to anyone who comes forward with information leading to the sniper , dead or alive .
the tape shows a shot during which the sniper manages to hit an american soldier in spite of the congestion of the street with cars passing by fast , and in spite of the presence of several children next to him .
the sniper of baghdad has become known for his special method , since he shoots only one bullet , even if he has the opportunity for another kill . he also leaves the last bullet he shoots for the day and next to it a paper mentioning the number of those he hunted down on that day , and he signs it “ the sniper of baghdad passed by here . "
the sniper of baghdad provoked terror in the american soldiers , since not one of them trusts that he will return safe if he needs to get out of his armored vehicle .
and one of the american soldiers says , “ the moment we step out , we are certain that , in our minds , he is a real threat to us . ”
an american military analyst says , “ the hits were direct , in spite of their protection in armored cars , body armor and helmets . ”
a foreign newspaper pointed out that at the entrance of yarmouk hospital and in the midst of the congestion , a soldier of the marines was shot dead , followed by another soldier , and the source that succeeded in sniping the two soldiers and killing them at once was not known .
massive forces immediately surrounded the hospital and sealed the roads , completely searching the halls of the hospital , and in spite of that , no trace of the sniper was found , and the american forces reinforced their presence and prohibited iraqis from moving . then the houses opposite the hospital were searched but without any result .
in the end , the american soldiers had to abandon the guarding and they entered inside the hospital . and in the middle of the crowd a handwritten paper was found bearing the expression , “ the sniper of baghdad passed by here . ”

the honey of bees … a complete pharmacy
in surat al-nahl , the true one , all praise and majesty to him , says : “ and thy lord taught the bees , build your homes in the mountains , on trees , and in people ’ s dwellings . then eat of all the fruits , and take the lord ’ s path . there comes from their bellies a drink of various colors , wherein is healing for people ; verily in this is a sign for those who think . ”
and it is told that the messenger of god , god ’ s prayers and peace upon him , said : “ take the two healers : honey and the qur ’ an . ”
and he also said , “ whoever laps of it three mornings a month will be spared the greatest scourges .
dr. abdul - rahman al-najjar , professor of pharmacology and therapeutics at the college of medicine at the university of cairo confirms that there are many benefits to bees ' honey in treatment and therapy . in addition to what is said about it in the holy qur ’ an and in the traditions of the messenger , god ’ s blessings and peace upon him , ancient scientists and physicians mention it in their writings , and many physicians , experts and professors of pharmacology and nutrition in most countries of the world , work in researching it .
the components of honey
bees ' honey is made up of the following components :
natural carbohydrates : so far , 15 types of sugars have been discovered in it , the most important being fruit sugar ( fructose ) , 40 % , grape sugar ( glucose ) , 30 % , whereas sugar cane ( sucrose ) is 4 % . one kilogram of honey provides energy estimated at 3,250 calories .
the enzymes , which help in digesting nutrients , the most important being : barley enzyme ( amylase ) which converts starch into grape sugar , calabin ( invertase ) which turns normal sugar into grape sugar and fruit sugar , catalase and peroxidase which are required in oxidation processes and assimilation of foodstuffs , and lipase which helps in the digestion and assimilation of fatty substances .
it also contains a group of vitamins , most notably , vitamins b1 , b2 , b3 , b5 and b6 , which are , respectively , thiamin , riboflavin , pantothenic acid , niacinic acid , perodoxin , and vitamin c ( ascorbic acid ) , vitamin k , vitamin e and vitamin a . also in honey are present certain kinds of proteins , amino acids , organic acids such as bee acid and formic acid , and derivatives of chlorophyll and aromatic smells .
honey also contains many mineral salts , most notably : calcium , sodium , potassium , manganese , iron , chlorine , phosphorus , sulfur and iodine . these salts constitute 0.2 % by weight of honey .
many researchers assert that there are substances in honey that inhibit the growth of bacteria , and it is believed that there is a plant hormone and a type of sex hormones ( derivatives of estrogen ) .
nutrition and a therapy for children
about the nutritive and therapeutic benefits of honey for children , dr. abdul - rahman al-najjar says : “ bee honey is an excellent nutritive and therapeutic substance for the child , since it protects children against bacterial diseases and intestinal molds because of its antibiotic characteristics , and it has a clear ability for growing bones , teeth emergence , and the calcification of bones and teeth , and consequently it adds to the growth of the child and protects him against the danger of rickets .
bees honey also increases hemoglobin and the number of red blood cells . it noticeably improves the child ’ s condition , especially those who suffer from digestive disorders such as diarrhea , poor absorption or malnutrition . it is an excellent source of energy , and speeds up the healing of children who suffer from the diseases that afflict them . it helps them gain weight , which is why most scientists recommend the addition of honey to the child ’ s nutrition at various stages of its development .
as dr. al-najjar says , honey is beneficial in several diseases of the chest , such as tuberculosis of the lung , since it was found to increase the resistance of the body . in the past , hippocrates said , “ drinking honey removes phlegm and stops coughing , and one soviet scientist - they conducted the most studies on bee honey - found that giving patients 150 grams of honey daily for lung disease patients improves their condition , increases their weight , reduces coughing , increases their level of hemoglobin and reduces the sedimentation speed .
in ancient medical records , there are many popular prescriptions containing honey for the treatment of lung diseases , and popular medicine continued to use honey for the treatment of tuberculosis for centuries , either mixed with yogurt or animal fat .
activating the liver .
dr. abdul - rahman al-ziadi , professor of digestive system and liver diseases at the college of medicine at ain - shams university emphasizes that bees honey is the best medicine for the diseases of the digestive system and the liver , and he says :
“ bees honey is a good source of energy because the carbohydrates present in it are immediately amenable to digestion and assimilation , which is why athletes use bees honey to increase their muscle strength and multiply their ability to endure .
dr. al-ziadi notes that bees honey acquires greater importance in the treatment of acute hepatitis , for it is to the liver what electric power is to the battery . leaving the battery uncharged ruins it , and similarly leaving the liver without carbohydrates exposes it to the deposition of lipids in its cells . ”
dr. al-ziadi adds : “ bee honey contains a substance that activates the liver ’ s functions , in addition to the vitamins , minerals , proteins and enzymes . therefore , using 25 grams of honey three times a day gives the chronic liver patient vitality and energy , and eliminates apathy and indolence .
of the primary clinical manifestations of liver cancer is a drop in the level of sugar in the patient ’ s blood , which causes dizziness , headaches , and weakness . bees honey is considered is a ready source of energy that runs from the intestines to the blood immediately without waiting for chemical reactions , since the sugar of honey is a sugar monomer .
dr. al-ziadi believes that taking 25 grams of honey three times a day is the fastest and cheapest treatment for these conditions , and thus , the patient is free of injections from the large glucose bottles and all that accompany them in burden on the patient and the physician .
in addition to all the preceding , honey is beneficial in the following diseases :
treatment for skin diseases , particularly purulence , cankers and septic wounds , and modern research has shown that it speeds up the closure and cleansing of wounds because it contains glutathione which accelerates the process of tissue adhesion . it also is beneficial in non - sterile operations such as hemorrhoids and operation for women ’ s diseases .
an excellent therapy for nervous disorders , and doctors say that a cup of lukewarm water in which two or three spoonfuls of honey are dissolved , taken as a drink before sleep is conducive to peaceful sleep .
the benefits of bees honey to heart patients are known since antiquity . avicenna considered honey an excellent therapy for the diseases of the heart , and he used to advise taking a reasonable amount of honey with pomegranate daily for those suffering from heart problems .
it has been proven that honey has medical benefits in the treatment of ulcerative mouth inflammation , and it has been shown that honey has benefits in the treatment of the inflammations of the nose and the dry pharynx , either by administering honey in a regular fashion or by injecting it locally .
it has been shown that bees honey protects against the impact of radiation , and protects the human body against cancers . a study has been conducted on beekeepers ( those who take care of bees ) and a corresponding group of same age and social conditions . it turned out that very few beekeepers develop cancers in comparison to those in other trades , with the rate of cancer incidence among beekeepers at 0.036 % whereas that rate among liquor manufacturing workers is 0.46 % or more than the former rate by about 13 fold .
a story that happens a lot and everywhere
the candles of blackness
a story that happens a lot and everywhere
peace be with you and his mercy and blessings
this is a bittersweet story that happens everywhere in the arab nation … so i wanted to tell it to you …
have you tried love ! !
she was sitting with some of her friends listening to a bit of their news .
for a long time , she had not sat at a get together like this .
the topics were numerous and varied , but what attracted her attention was a topic she was hearing for the first time and which astonished her exceedingly .
because this colleague was talking about an imaginary life and about things she did not know about .
she sat listening to her colleagues ’ words .
and suddenly the question came to her that shook her foundations .
don ’ t you know love ?
so she answered innocently
no
so her colleagues said to her
you have not yet lived your life and you have not enjoyed it .
so they sat telling her about love and the innocent relationship with the other party .
she came back home and thought about the matter .
she sat down asking herself and conversing with herself
why do i live differently from people ?
rather , why do i live differently from my friends ?
don ’ t have the right to try ?
i want to feel my femininity and my being , i am a girl who has sensations and feelings .
so why this repression and until when will i continue living alone with no one to share my worries ?
and why this traditional marriage ?
i want to marry for love …
and other questions and heart discussions that whirled in her thoughts .
then the days came and went .
and the issue became more entrenched in her mind and her thoughts .
then she met a young man and her heart became attached to him and she loved him greatly
she couldn ’ t sleep if she hadn ’ t hear his voice
and he , too .
moreover , he swore to her that he will marry her and he wants her and he wants nobody else but her .
all of this without she seeing him and he seeing her . only over the telephone .
then the young man became urging her that he wants to see her .
because he could not bear it any longer .
and after much insistence and a back and forth
the girl agreed that this would be the first time and the last time .
so they agreed on a specific place .
then he saw her and she saw him briefly and her heart went crazy for him .
the days passed and she became more attached to him .
then she started going out with him for brief moments that stretched to hours .
and one way or another , this girl fell into the sin that she never expected would ever happen to her , and she lost her honor .
and after this happened , she asked the young man to marry her and present himself to her in order to – as they say – atone for his mistake and erase his behavior .
but the young man ’ s answer was , “ who told you i will marry you ? ”
“ i do not marry a girl i met on the street ” .
so she threatened to tell about him .
and he threatened her with photos and letters he had .
so she wept and screamed and hurt .
and she lived her life in worry , grief and bitterness that only god knows about .
this story , my honorable sister , you hear it and i hear it .
and the girl is always the victim .
she is the one to fall for the lies and deceptions .
so beware , my sister , lest you be one of them .
i hope you liked the topic .

five british casualties and iraqi insistence on resisting
islam today / reuters / amer al-kabissi
the british defense ministry announced that one british soldier was killed and four others injured in the explosion of a bomb placed by the roadside in the city of basra in the south of iraq .
the spokesman added that an investigation is ongoing in the circumstances of the incident , but he refused to reveal any details until the relatives of the soldier are notified .
it is noted that 98 british soldiers were killed in iraq since the beginning of the war in 2003 according to the claims of the occupation forces .
britain has about 8,000 soldiers in the south of iraq and it is the closest ally of the united states in the war .
this comes at a time when the us army announced that two primitively - made bombs killed five of its soldiers who were on patrol near the iraqi town of biji , while five other soldiers were injured in the two explosions .
the us army said that the soldiers were with the 1st airborne division and were the subject of two separate attacks .
biji is located at a distance of 180 km to the north of baghdad .
earlier , the us army announced that a sixth soldier died as a result of injuries he sustained in an attack that took place last thursday , also near biji . with this , the number of american soldiers who have been killed in iraq since its invasion by the united states in march 2003 is at least 2,089 dead .
the announcement of the death of the five american soldiers coincides with the death of 48 people at least in the explosion of two booby - trapped cars in the north and the south of baghdad .
elsewhere , four factions of the armed iraqi resistance issued a joint statement about the ongoing political process in the country and the ills it entails .
the resistance factions said that they will continue hounding the occupation and will not stop until it ends .
the following is the statement issued by the factions :
in the name of god most merciful most compassionate
statement to our patient iraqi people in our struggling country
the dear nation is going through an important phase of its political phases , and the resistance factions have their own understanding and analysis of what is going on , which are represented in the following points :
1 - the sectarian and ethnic polarization , the security deterioration and the corruption that our country is suffering from in all sectors of the state is only due to the occupation and its policies . as such , any remedy to the political situation must begin with a remedy of the cause … which is the withdrawal of the occupation and leaving the country to its own people , since they alone are capable of guiding its rudder .
2 - the entire political process that has taken place since the entry of the occupation up to this date is one of the results of the occupation , which is why this mistake must be corrected with the distancing of political and civilian movements distancing themselves from the occupation and working via a national agenda that is distant from the protection of the occupier or that implements a foreign agenda .
3 - our problem is specifically with the occupier and his agents , and the ongoing reconciliation between the political poles is a matter of no concern to us , neither from near nor from afar .
what reconciliation is this when the occupier is striking our homes ? he destroys our children ’ s houses over them , and his agents threatening to destroy houses over the women , the children and the elderly , and the sectarian gangs desecrating the houses of the peaceful , and the secret and public prisons that are filled with the detainees and the oppressed .
4 - the militias are one of the reasons for the security deterioration in the country , which is why they must disband and not be merged with the army or the security services . rather , the army and the police should be formed on a national and professional basis that is unrelated to any one party , and the army should not be used in confronting the sons of our country or to stand as an obstacle between us and the occupier or to defend him .
5 - the constitution that is ratified in its current form will be the ( ( mother of all evils ) ) in the future of iraq . therefore , our other mission is to resist this constitution and ensure its failure by every possible means . this is a mission that is not lesser than fighting the infidel occupier .
6 - as resistance factions , we realize that our people is made up of different groups , and god almighty says , “ we made you into nations and tribes , that you may know each other . ” each group has the right to enjoy the wealth of our dear country , but within the unavoidable principles which are the unity of this country , its independence , and in which human rights are preserved . so whoever is with us in this , we are with him in developing and advancing our country . whoever deviates from the road and abandons the path in this , we are watching him .
finally , the resistance in its unified factions pledges to god almighty , then to this proud people , that its weapons will remain pointed at the occupation and its agents who have sold themselves to satan . it will develop its resistance such that it leads to the defeat of the occupier and to his departure from our pure land in submission and humiliation .
“ god will certainly help those who help him ; for verily god is powerful and exalted in strength . ”

pele predicts the brazilian team as the winner of the world cup 2006
at a press conference held last friday during ceremonies at the academy for sports excellence aspire in qatar , brazilian soccer legend pele said that the team of his country is the best candidate for winning the soccer world cup that is to be hosted by germany in the summer of next year 2006 .
pele in particular praised the performance of the famous coach carlos alberto parreira who succeeded in increasing the cohesion between the champions of brazilian samba .
pele added that the brazilian team includes in its ranks the best soccer players in the world at the present time , and that there are a number of brazilian reserve players who hope to share in the ranks of the world ’ s title holders .
however , the player of the century knows well that things will not be easy for his country ’ s team , especially since it failed many times in grabbing the title in spite of its displaying a brilliant performance .
it is well - known that the team that is expected to win does not always accomplish that , as was the case with the dutch team in 1974 and 1978 , the brazilian team in 1982 , and france in 2002 .
bahrain squanders the opportunity to qualify for the 2006 mundial in germany .
in the aftermath of the qualification playoffs for the finals of the 2006 world cup in germany , the bahraini team was defeated by its guest the trinidad and tobago team in a one to zero scored by the player lawrence at the 49th minute after he received a splendid ball from his teammate , the international offense player dwight yorke .
the first match was weak and the bahraini did little to shake the net of the guests .
perhaps their main concern was in keeping their own net clean , especially that the departure meet that was held last saturday ended up in a positive one to one tie , which means that it was sufficient for the bahraini red team to tie at zero zero in the return match on its soil in order to qualify to the mundial .
but it failed in doing this , in spite of an improvement in its performance in the second match and an intensification of its attack on the guests ’ net as it tried to reach a tie .
and during the additional replacement time , the game referee ruis acosta canceled a goal scored by ali hussein , which roused the anger of the bahraini players who failed to qualify for the soccer world cup for the first time in the history of bahrain .
this means that the arab participation in mundial germany 2006 will be limited to the two arab teams , the saudis and tunisians , both of which qualified directly for the mundial .
bahrain ties with trinidad and tobago in the supplementary departure game .
the bahraini team achieved a valuable one to one tie in the supplementary meet that pitted it against the trinidad and tobago team on the latter ’ s soil .
with this , the red team conserved an opportunity to follow in the footsteps of those who qualified for mundial germany 2006 .
in the last games of the supplementary qualifiers for mundial germany 2006 , the bahrainis offered a good performance and almost achieved an unexpected victory outside their home base .
the guest team advanced with a goal scored by salman at the 72nd minute .
but the joy lasted only five minutes when birchall scored the tie goal for trinidad and tobago at the 77th minute .
in spite of this , the bahrainis still have a big opportunity to make it to the mundial , especially since they are playing the return game next wednesday on their turf and in front of their own public .
will the red bahraini team succeed in qualifying for the finals of the soccer world cup for the first time in its history ?
this is what will become clear next wednesday after the encounter with trinidad and tobago in the bahraini capital al-manama .

sadr city and america
sadr city is an islamic city and it is inhabited by the iraqi people .
but sadr city hates the americans because they are violating the sanctity of the holy qur ’ an .
and sadr city is a follower of the leader sayyed muqtada al-sadr , may god prolong his glory .
we think that the iraqi police has no business here because sadr city is protected thanks to the imam mahdi army , which is an ideological moslem - thinking army .

and when i opened the door on my husband
the city adolescent
when i opened the door on my husband ! ! !
in the name of god , the compassionate , the merciful
when i opened the door on my husband i couldn ’ t imagine that my husband , the father of four children who has never closed the door on himself and got on the computer , was deep into looking at sexual pictures and movies .
i was so disappointed when i walked into the room he was in which he forgot to lock that disastrous day ! on that day i felt a very intense dizziness that almost made me fall to the ground .
what a saddening and shameful scene when i caught him red - handed doing that disgraceful thing ! i never imagined that recklessness would get him to this point where he becomes so weak in controlling his will and would use his eyes to gaze at a sight which his lord , who gave him those eyes , has forbidden to be seen .
. . !
i lost my strength when i saw our children ’ s primary educator committing this dirty deed , which portrays in his mind that sex is life .
now he is losing everything and he might not be trusted to take care of the children he is responsible for and he will not be good at bringing them up because he can ’ t give what he does not have .
! ! !
these are the words of a desperate woman . her words were disjointed and mixed with tears . that woman said this after finding out that her husband was not the man she knew .
this is a reality that we should not ignore or avoid . .
words like this have increased from women about their husbands ’ involvement in those impure sites that affect the minds and hearts .
they are avoiding their responsibilities and their tasks such as childrearing and educating those for whom they are responsible .
they have even stopped having sex with their wives .
there is no power and no strength except in god .
how could someone run from chastity to the depravity of these pornographic sites that destroy the hearts of youths before adults .
how could that father be so reckless as to be absent from home when he is sitting at home , and bring into his own home such shameful things while he sits in front of that screen that takes him from bad to worse .
how could he do that when gray hair covers his cheeks ? or is it failure on the supervision test administered by the knowing god ?
it is a huge disaster when the biggest pyramid in the house suffers from this illness .
it is a shameful disaster when the children and the wife find out that the head of the household is among prostitutes and web sites that repel angels and attract devils .
it is a big disaster when the husband forsakes his wife and probably resorts to masturbation , an act that angers his god .
it is a very dangerous turning point when he allows himself to get acquainted with dubious and degraded people to satisfy that perverse desire of his .
so , what is the value of marriage and chastity then ?
and what would this absent man ’ s position be if he had found his wife doing such a thing ?
would he ignore the matter or flex his muscles at her ? would he hide behind purity and serenity ?
mr. righteous husband .
the ease with which such depravity can be accessed may have the biggest role in pulling you into doing that disgraceful thing .
there might be a reason or reasons that led you to do such a thing ,
but how long will you continue to do this ?
until when will you continue to pile up a great amount of sins for the sake of satisfying your own needs ?
don ’ t you fear that your life journey will end while you are still at that shameful state in your life ?
don ’ t you fear being unmasked in a way reveals the state you ’ re in ?
don ’ t you feel ashamed being this way in front of a god who sees what you ’ re doing ?
god , who created you , put you together , and blessed you is watching everything you are doing in that far away place , hidden from all but the eyes of god who is closer to you than your veins .
mr. decent father .
don ’ t you know that by doing what you are doing you are participating to a great extent in the corruption of society ?
yes . otherwise who would believe that one day so - and - so the son of so - and - so , the calm and wise man who is only mentioned by people in a good way , would turn his secure home into a center for receiving the largest quantity of moral depravity . his mind and his thoughts absorb it all causing him to lose his determination and resolution , thus weakening his ability to keep his mind on and apply himself to those who are under his care , those who may be the cause for his entrance into hell if he deceives them instead of giving them good advice .
the messenger of god ( god bless him and grant him salvation ) said : " there is no person whom allah has placed in charge of others , who dies while he is insincere towards his people , but allah will forbid him paradise . "
so i ask you , will what you are doing - - nourishing your soul in a perverted way - - improve and benefit those you are in charge of ?
i don ’ t think so , because you can ’ t give what you do not have .
mr. decent husband .
just sit down by yourself and take a few minutes to examine candidly what you are doing in front of the computer , and weigh its good and bad . how many positives and how many negatives are there ? has it affected your level of religiousness and faith ?
then you will see the real you .
after that i don ’ t think you will overlook the fact that the consequences are not positive if you continue on the decadent path .
the believer does not get bitten twice in the same burrow .
may god bestow upon us fear inwardly and outwardly . may he make us pious and faithful . may he help us to remain faithful to ourselves and to others . may god bless his noble prophet , the one who most fears the lord of the universe .
the glory of reformed person .

pornography and sexually transmitted diseases
abdallah al-ra ' uji
thanks to god , lord of the universe . may god bless and grant salvation to his prophet muhammad , and all his family and friends .
now to our topic :
in my concern for my adolescent brothers , i would like to underline some words that came out of a compassionate loving heart for everyone who believes in god and the last day . i am warning him of sexually transmitted diseases which are experiencing such a significant spread in the licentious countries in general and in the arab counties in particular . youth find many seductive materials that arouse their sexual instincts in the licentious countries , and they mingle with people who have been overcome with such diseases . then they go back to their countries carrying in their body the germs of sexual diseases . they suffer from anxiety , depression , sorrow , and failure in life . they become a vehicle for the distribution of these germs into the innocent families in our conservative societies , either the wife or the children through kissing , touching , or using their things such as towels .
the topic of sexually transmitted diseases is of great importance to doctors because of the risks they pose for the physical and psychological health of individuals and groups .
the biggest evidence for international concern with these diseases was the huge conference that was held in the united states in 1974 on venereal disease and similar diseases . this conference was attended by 1,500 specialists from 50 countries . their lectures were collected in a huge book of more than 500 pages .
the 13th edition of the merck medical reference ( 1977 ) says that diseases transmitted through sex ( fornication ) and abnormal sexual relationships are the most widespread diseases in the world today . the number of people suffering from these diseases has been increasing every year over approximately the last two decades .
the world health organization estimates that more than 150,000 people contract gonorrhea each year . the number of people who contract from syphilis , which is known in some arab counties as the european disease , is more than 50,000 a year .
according to the centers for disease control in atlanta , georgia , in the united states , the number of people suffering from gonorrhea in the united states was estimated to be three million , and the number of people suffering from syphilis was estimated at 400,000 in the year 1976 .
according to the may , 1983 issue of graduate doctor magazine and the july 4 , 1983 issue of the american magazine time 20 million americans suffer from genital herpes and half a million new cases are diagnosed every year in the united states .
in britain 15,000 new cases were diagnosed in 1982
despite much research and huge amounts of money spent on sexually transmitted diseases in the west , they are spreading day after day along with abnormal sexual activities .
the danger of these sexual diseases caused by forbidden sexuality is that they are easily spread from the infected person to the healthy person . some of them are spread through sexual intercourse and others by kisses from the disease carrier , and others are spread through touching or direct contact with the disease carrier ’ s things .
in these lines will concentrate on four widespread sexually transmitted diseases : gonorrhea , syphilis , genital herpes , aids , and some other diseases . for this i have referred to some books on sexual diseases and medical magazines .
one of these disease is : first : gonorrhea
gonorrhea is a common sexual disease that is easily transmitted . symptoms of infection start to appear three to seven days after the suspected intercourse .
symptoms of gonorrhea in men include painful discharges and a burning sensation when urinating . in women it just causes some discharge .
if not treated to get rid of the bacteria completely , the gonorrhea bacteria can remain dormant for some time before it starts appearing in other parts of the body causing complications of the disease . it might cause sterility in women , arthritis , and heart troubles .
gonorrhea is one of the most widespread sexually transmitted diseases because contracting it is very easy and fast .
transmission of the disease :
gonorrhea is transmitted through sex , and in rare cases by sitting on a contaminated european toilet seat or using a contaminated towel , sponge , scale , or anything else that carries the live bacteria , through touching or direct contact .
symptoms of gonorrhea :
the symptoms usually start with stinging pain during urination . some complain of difficulty urinating or dysuria . after 24 hours or more , the individual starts noticing pus coming out of the urethra . the pus could be thick or slimy depending on the type of bacteria causing it .
the first thing that catches the infected individual ’ s attention is the appearance of gonorrhea from the urethra or the vagina , and a fever with a headache and an increased pulse rate .
after two weeks , the burning and pain during urination increases or the opposite might happen where and the symptoms decrease to a point that the infected person will not be concerned about it .
the gonorrhea bacteria might attack the circulatory system and cause serious complications to the heart , meninges , or joints , or it might attack the tubes and testicles .
a determination that a patient has gonorrhea can be made only after confirming that the bacteria is present in the discharges . at the same time , not finding the bacteria in an examination does not necessarily mean that the person does not have gonorrhea , because the bacteria might appear later on . therefore , it is necessary to repeat the tests on consecutive days .
second : syphilis
syphilis is one of the most dangerous venereal diseases for people because of its effect on most parts of the body , even after many years . it is a dangerous disease if the person goes without treatment . the victim may suffer ill effects years after contracting the disease . its danger increases since the symptoms at first may be mild and not attended to . it causes a painless local ulcer that disappears on its own within two or three weeks , during which time it has spread to most parts of the body .
transmission of the disease :
syphilis is transmitted through direct sexual intercourse , kissing , blood transfusion from a disease carrier to a healthy person , serving as a nurse for a carrier of the disease , and using the personal items of the of syphilis carrier , and drinking water directly from a cup they ’ ve used .
symptoms of syphilis :
syphilis has three stages :
the first stage : the primary stage is the syphilis ulcer , which is a small ulcer that might not catch the infected person ’ s attention . it resembles a cigarette burn . this ulcer keeps growing until it eventually it heals after six weeks . the incubation period of the disease is three to four weeks . this ulcer appears on the body parts as well as on the areas of contact .
the second stage : the secondary stage : the syphilis bacteria spreads throughout the body . this stage starts after the appearance of the syphilis ulcer , which might take months , and is characterized by severe dermal rash in about 80 percent of cases . the patient will suffer from inflammation of the bones , the eye , and the liver , as well as nausea , vomiting , constipation , and muscle pain , along with fever , headache , and fatigue .
a few weeks after the dermal symptoms in the secondary stage are gone , the latency stage starts and no symptoms appear .
the third stage : the last stage : this stage is characterized by the appearance of tumors that spread all over the body . this stage is from three to seven years .
third : genital herpes
genital herpes is one of the most dangerous sexually transmitted diseases because it is easily transmitted . it is transmitted through direct contact with the patient , using their personal belongings , kissing , sitting on toilet seats , or getting near someone who is infected . therefore it is not confined to the arabs , but it is transmitted by some travelers from and to certain countries of the middle east .
area of infection :
it attacks the genital areas , the anus , the upper thighs , the scrotum , the cervix , and the penis .
symptoms of the disease :
genital herpes starts with the appearance of blisters in the genital area , and there is a general feeling of fatigue and poor health .
the patient contracts the disease upon direct exposure to the infection . the incubation period continues for about five days before the symptoms start to appear .
then the disease starts to take the form of little inflamed spots on the skin . then small blisters filled with fluid start to appear over these spots forming blebs that are surrounded by red circles . then they are scratched and become wet superficial scratches covered with a transparent substance .
fourth : aids
aids is the acquired immune deficiency syndrome disease . it is an epidemic that comes as a result of moral depravity .
professor luc montagnier is considered the first person to discover the disease . in 1985 he discovered more than 740 cases of aids , according to the world health organization . aids is an incurable disease and there is no way out of it but by death , slow death .
this disease like other sexually transmitted diseases has an incubation period , but its incubation period is quite long , and ranges from three to seven years during which the person may carry the disease without showing any symptoms .
in its issue number 1526 of january 21 , 1986 the magazine al-hawadith published an interview it had held in bonn with professor dr. matfred franke , a specialist in aids . i will briefly mention some of the questions asked in the interview .
question : i heard that aids can be transmitted by kissing , what do you think ?
answer : yes , that is right . that happens when the kiss is so intense that saliva is exchanged or a small wound is caused inside the mouth , since the aids virus can enter the blood through wounds , no matter how small they are .
question : what are the symptoms of the disease and what happens in the body ?
answer : if someone contracts aids the length of time before the disease manifests itself may take from three to seven years . as far as what happens in the body , the virus enters the body through the blood vessels . then it becomes dangerous . it destroys the immune cells - - the white blood cells . at this stage , the cell stops functioning and the immune system starts to die out while the virus multiplies . when the immunity decreases the body stops resisting diseases .
question : what is the aids story ? where did it come from ? and how did it happen ?
answer : this virus first appeared in the 70s in central africa where this microbe was carried by one of the monkey species that people ate
it is thought that an american who was traveling there and had sex with a resident who had aids carried this virus back to america . because he was engaging in abnormal sexual behavior the disease started to spread until it reached us .
various other sexual diseases
1 - condyloma lata : is spread by touching and direct contact . the incubation stage is from one to six months . it appears in the moist areas such as the glands , the scrotum , the thighs , and the anus . the disease starts with a very small blister the size of the head of a pin which grows until it becomes prominent .
2 - molluscum contagiosum :
this disease spreads in swimming pools and bathrooms and is transmitted through contact or sexual intercourse . it appears as a white semi - circular blister covered with a waxy layer with an indentation at the center . it occurs in the genital area . patients usually do not feel any pain unless an infection occurs .
3 - lice :
especially lice in the pubic area which are spread through sexual intercourse and direct contact .
4 - mange
a disease that attacks the entire body except the face , is transmitted through contact , and causes severe itching
5 - ducrey 's bacillus :
painful ulcers that appear on the genitals and cause severe pain , appear inflamed , and appear less than a week after infection .
6 - lgf
a sexually transmitted disease with an incubation period of one to six weeks after which a small transparent pimple filled with fluid starts to appear on the genitals , which the patient may not notice it .
7 - granuloma inguinale
this is a chronic sexually transmitted disease that starts with blisters and blebs which later ulcerous . there are continuous prominent skin eruption on the genitals , the pubic area , the hips , the buttocks , the backside , and the anus .
a paradigm to learn from :
so that we will learn a lesson , we will mention this story : a young man went to a touristy western country and rented a furnished apartment . prostitutes came to him . this young man was unable to resist the temptation , and he ended up losing the battle and carrying the syphilis and gonorrhea germs .
a few years later he got married . when his wife was unable to get pregnant , he took her to a doctor . the doctor requested that his semen be tested .
the result : all of his sperm are dead because the diseases killed them . treatment was of no use . the doctor told him : this is god 's way of punishing you in this world . if you do not repent and ask for forgiveness the punishment in the hereafter will be even more severe .
god bless and grant salvation to his prophet muhammad , his family , and his friends .

haifa al qurayshi , from jeddah
21 / 11 / 2005
the small business group , which is a candidate in the chamber of commerce and industry elections , is organizing a meeting in jeddah tonight that introduces the group and explains its goals .
the meeting will include a lecture about the significance of the role of women in voting in the election campaign of the jeddah chamber of commerce and industry .
the members of the group confirmed that one of the most important goals for which the chambers of commerce and industry were established in the kingdom was to support its participating businesses and companies , deal with their problems , and convey their views to the official authorities .
despite all the efforts that have been made and are still being made to serve small businesses , they are still the ones that benefit least from the chamber of commerce 's services .
with regard to supporting saudi women and saudi businesswomen and the mechanisms for implementation in the real world , we have put together a number of serious goals that aim to actualize the role of women in a way that will support the local economy .
some of these goals are : backing and supporting the activities of women 's businesses and putting them on the priority list and establishing a special branch for businesswomen who are members of the chamber of commerce which will offer all the essential services to the chamber of commerce .

preparations to launch the first joint stock company to manage furnished apartments .
habib al-shimari from riyadh
businessmen in riyadh confirmed to al-iqtisadiya that they have begun serious and practical preparations to announce the first joint stock company to manage residential units ( furnished apartments ) in the country . that means developing apartment services and saving some of them from bankruptcy especially during off season .
faysal al-mutalliq , a member of the tourism and hotels committee in the riyadh chamber of commerce , told al-iqtisadiya that the idea emerged from the pressing need to develop the operation of furnished apartments to keep up with the economic and social growth in saudi arabia , and to match the support and encouragement domestic tourism receives from the concerned bodies .
in the meantime a decision was made to hold a meeting next monday in riyadh to discuss and investigate the idea .
al-mutallik said that the concept for the company ’ s operation is based on operating residential units , either through ownership or rental , especially those owned by others .
the proposed company 's capital is 50 million riyals , provided that the stock value for the founders is 500,000 .
al-mutallik also pointed out that the committee that was based on the idea has started to invite businessmen from different sectors , especially hotels , furnished apartments , real estate , and travel and tourism . he also mentioned that the purpose of this direction is to obtain the services and expertise of these sectors to enable the new company to provide outstanding service to the local travelers and consumers wherever they decide to travel or reside .
al-mutallik believes that established apartments will be profitable when they are added to the company , noting that the stock might be in kind or in cash . in this case the owners of the apartments will guarantee that their operations will be in accordance with the most modern methods which rely on good service , marketing , and additional services that will ensure that they are competitive in the market .
there are 1,500 furnished apartment buildings in saudi arabia , with more than 33,000 residential units . mecca takes the lead with about 604 furnished apartment buildings with 12,500 residential units . riyadh is in second place with 233 furnished apartment buildings with 4,350 residential units . medina has 221 apartment buildings with 7,970 residential units . al-sharqiya is next with 188 furnished apartment buildings with 3,900 units . asir has 123 apartment buildings with 1,700 residential units .
despite the significant rise in the number of furnished apartments in saudi arabia since the mid 90s through their spread in various regions , there is a shortage in the services they provide whether directly or indirectly .
the spread of furnished apartments has affected the hotel market because of their relatively lower prices than hotels , their suitability for saudi families since they have more bedrooms , living rooms , and kitchens to prepare food , which is not allowed in hotels .
some saudis and foreigners rely on the apartments as a temporary or long term residence , especially for employees and students , who pay monthly or bi - annual rent .
the apartments suffer from the high cost of electricity and some services . previously , a large number of furnished apartments almost declared bankruptcy after the adjustment of electricity prices in the year 2000 before the government intervened .

shareholders are requesting that the interior ministry accept 850 million riyals from an investor ( sawa
ali al-maqbali from mecca
20 / 10 / 2005
the chief shareholders in the sawa case are determined to present a demand to the concerned authorities to accept the money that the investor , sawa abd al-aziz al-juhani has conceded to the interior ministry represented in the case ’ s supervisor , abd al-aziz al-muhanna , to be in charge of the handing over of the money that has been settled on by the heads of the groups , and which totals 850 million riyals .
this action by the shareholders comes after al-juhani ’ s announcement yesterday that he is donating 30 million riyals to his partner , muhammad al-shamrani , to get him out of prison for writing bad checks .
in their talks with al-iqtisadiya the shareholders demanded that the interior ministry intervene and confiscate the funds that are in al-juhani ’ s possession , and hand them over to the shareholders . they pointed out that on more than one occasion al-juhani promised to return their money but never followed through with those promises .
at the end of last month al-juhani had promised to return the shareholders ' money in the suspicious partnerships that appeared about a year ago in jeddah .
during a meeting between him and the heads of 30 groups al-juhani mentioned that before the beginning of ramadan he would begin to pay back the shareholders ' money in the sawa case , which totals 850 million riyals . he announced that he was prepared to return the money to the heads of these groups , who in turn would then pay the small shareholders , but al-juhani did not follow through with those promises .
abd al-aziz al-muhanna , the monitor assigned to the case by the interior ministry , disclosed to al-iqtisadiya that the time limit would expire on the sixth of next shawal . he confirmed that al-juhani would return to prison at the end of the time limit if he fails to pay back the money .
al-muhanna was surprised by al-juhani ’ s statement about donating 30 million to his partner al-shamrani , and demanded that al-juhani hand over the money , the case be closed , and that he be released from prison provided he promises to pay back the money
the shareholders and heads of the groups with the investor al-juhani expressed their surprise about al-juhani ’ s donation of 30 million riyals to release al-shamrani before returning the shareholders ' money as he promised . they demanded that the interior ministry commissioner and the supervisor assigned to the case to take action so that they get their money back .
joining the trade organization will restore equilibrium to the saudi economy
saudi businesswomen
joining the trade organization will restore equilibrium to the saudi economy
after a long wait the kingdom has been accepted for membership in the world trade organization ( wto ) , bringing with it a blur for many about the impact that it will have on the current saudi economy , whether positive or negative , and on the kingdom ’ s economic planning as a whole .
with a membership that exceeds 150 members , the organization 's system has become international . thus , the kingdom ’ s affiliation with the organization will without doubt be less harmful than not joining it and isolating itself from the standards of international trade .
but those in the business sector must reconsider doing business and measuring their success and growth in relation to the advanced and developed countries . they must also examine their companies ’ operations from a broad , international , multifaceted perspective , and not from a narrow , local perspective that is not updated , as some have been used to do in the past .
the nature of the saudi companies ’ operations is mostly commercial ( importing and commercial agencies ) . joining the organization means the end of the exclusive agencies within five years at most . this will , without a doubt , result in an imbalance or temporary disturbances ( shake up ) in the post - joining period because of some imbalances and the restructuring of the business sector .
this will benefit the consumer in the intermediate and long term because of the increased competition . the elimination of the agent ’ s profit margins is also better for the consumer because that will result in lower prices and better quality .
the continued dependency of many saudi businessmen on commercial agencies and not attempting to innovate with similar local products , has caused the suffocation of the saudi economy in the past as in some other developing countries . therefore , its elimination will , without a doubt , encourage many businessmen to rethink the development of their businesses and diversifying their activities in accordance with their specialties and skills .
but on the other hand , the layoffs that will result from the elimination or contraction of the commercial agencies are a problem the kingdom will be facing along with the ensuing rise in unemployment . that may be very incompatible with current ineffective saudi policies ( by focusing on the service sectors such as discharging construction workers and taxi drivers ) . some companies will go bankrupt and some employees will be laid off .
thus , restoring equilibrium becomes a more complicated matter , in which most responsibility is divided between the citizen himself and his desire for change and the local educational institutions , in addition to the ministries ' comprehensive strategies , including those for achieving economic growth .
integration as a basis for doing business in the business sector , not cooperation or competition , has become a pressing need .
all that we are doing now is bringing on a foreign factory or agency , hiring foreign workers to make foreign products , selling the product and earning a few crumbs ( in comparison to what the parent company is earning ) as a margin of profit .
most of what we have now is merely an income given as a gift by almighty god - - god gifted gdp ( ggg ) - - from crude oil , not a national or local product made in the country .
businessmen and wealthy people in the kingdom must redirect their resources away from the non - competitive industries that enjoy protection and towards the industries in which the kingdom has relative advantages and an ability to compete internationally .
import agencies as business agencies still constitute 45 percent of the total number of mid to large size companies ( more than 100 employees ) , in addition to the construction companies which constitute another 30 percent , while manufacturing companies are not more than two percent of the total number of large companies .
the growth of these service companies does not create a fast growing economy and does not help to create new jobs to meet the demand , but rather it increases the concentration of wealth only among their owners , and suffocates the consumer forces in the economy .
the question here is how will the businessmen and businesswomen , in cooperation with the financial institutions and investment banks , move towards manufacturing , information technology , and constructive strategic planning , thereby decreasing the current structural defects , which is a necessity to work with the trade organization ’ s membership requirements .
joining the organization also has social and economic benefits , the most important of which is changing the cultural mentality from a desire to make easy money from investments like buying real estate or sterile speculation in the stock market in what is called paper wealth , and which creates long term economic strangulation , to investments that are characterized by international benefits , the achievement of stability , and economic balance .
so there is no other way than to move more and more towards innovation and development in the various fields of business in the kingdom .
for the sake of that , spending on research and development must increase to continually update information , turn it into business plans in the companies ’ fields , determine the sources of competition and the areas for cooperation with foreign companies , and keep track of the latest technological and scientific developments in the field of the goods that the companies produce . as a result , the local rate of development for manufactured products will increase , patents on inventions will be acquired , by which the companies will be able to achieve sufficient revenues that far exceed the commission from selling the products of foreign companies and exporting a larger portion of the revenue to foreign economies .
on the other hand , mergers and acquisitions among companies that will take place after joining the organization will result in increasing competence and reducing the producer 's fixed costs through what is called " economies of scale " which in turn benefit the consumer and raise his standard of living .
the increase in mergers and strategic alliances among businesses , whether with local or foreign companies , comes as a result of the influx of investments entering the country because of the increased levels of competence and the expansion of companies ’ production capabilities . as a result , costs decrease so local companies are able to compete internationally with foreign mega - companies .
such a merger might be under the umbrella of the merging company or through the establishment of new companies that include the merging companies .
however , it is worth mentioning here the requirement guaranteeing that the saudi companies get a good share in this partnership with the foreign company and that the foreign company does not possess the majority of the shares so that the companies remain national companies and their revenues benefit the local economy .
furthermore , the saudi companies must try to have as many shares as possible in the foreign manufacturing , financial , and technical companies . they will thereby be able to expand internationally , which will provide a big financial benefit to the local economy .
the government ’ s role here is to remain alert to prohibit mergers that will result in monopolies for some companies , and that the ministry of commerce continues to guarantee healthy competition , including efficient performance , and a decrease in prices and profit margins .
some might say now that we are against monopoly and for competition , not mergers .
but i say that mergers will be different from one sector to another and from one industry to another because opening the door to foreign competition in some service sectors , for example , requires big local mergers and restructuring these companies so that they function in accordance with international standards .
to give you an example , the number of saudi banks is currently small . but in spite of that , i am a strong advocate for their merging , restructuring , and using updated strategies so they can keep up with the competition from foreign banks for which the monetary agency has opened the local market and granted them licenses to operate in the kingdom . this represents a healthy banking policy by the monetary agency to strengthen the competition , especially by gradually continuing to grant licenses in the future to various banks from various countries with an international reputation and distinctive and innovative banking products .
an indication of the necessity for mergers is that the assets of gulf banks combined does not exceed $ 500 billion , while the assets of a single american bank , such as bank of america , is $ 1.11 trillion , which without doubt reflects the lower valuation and gives foreign banks a much greater capacity to grow and reduce lending expenses in comparison to the local banks .
when we compare the size of companies in general , we find that the sales of one american company , general electric , for example , amounted to $ 153 billion in the year 2004 , which is more than half of the entire saudi economy which had a gnp of about $ 266 billion in the same year . this means that some giant international companies control a huge economic force that may be equivalent to the entire economy of a nation .
from another angle , joining the organization will , god willing , serve to apply intense pressure for changing the old and complicated commercial laws and rules that obstruct businesses , and to speed up reforms in the banking industry , the financial institutions , and other businesses .
then there will be an increasing need for skilled foreign workers to use their expertise in the restructuring operations and introducing changes , especially in financial services , accounting , and business and legal consulting .
that will have a negative effect on the balance of payments because of the increased money transfers in the short term . but it will without doubt have a positive impact on the economy as a whole in the long run if there is a transfer to the saudis of production expertise which has additional value , and if they are able to replace the foreigners as time goes by .
liberating the service sector will also encourage the return of local capital and foreign investments from abroad , even though there will be some risk that these investments might face , especially for foreigners , as a result of the commercial liberation that happened in the early stages of the reforms and changing the laws in the kingdom .
therefore , speed and a high level of professionalism in changing laws will , god willing , help to encourage the flow of money into the country and rapid economic growth in the kingdom .
but there is a major positive aspect which is that the demand for creative and highly skilled saudi workers with rigorous specialties will increase , and their true value will become evident allowing them to obtain what they deserve in the way of suitable positions and suitable material compensation because everybody will need them and look for them thereby giving the sword to the one who sharpened it .
no matter how experienced the skilled foreign experts are , the productivity of an experienced saudi expert will be much better because he possesses practical , cultural , and social knowledge of the local area in addition to his practical expertise of international standards which enables him to achieve results far superior to those achieved by foreigners with only practical experience . thereafter , the saudi workforce will direct its attention to excelling in specific fields of expertise that are needed in various businesses , and they will try to obtaining it from local or foreign sources , even if that means going to china .
a point worth mentioning is that as a result of reduced customs tariffs - - and the subsequent reduced prices of imports - - the kingdom 's gross national product will grow , according to my estimates and on the basis of specific economic averages , at a rate of not less than 0.95 percent per year , in addition to the other positive results and their compound influences in improving productivity and workforce competencies .
in addition , the strategies to expand the processing industries sector such as petrochemicals and other industries with not less than double their production capacity , and the elimination of foreign tariffs on these products as a result of the kingdom ’ s membership in the organization , will cause the gross national product to grow by not less than five percent average annual real growth during the next few years , particularly if companies establish a strategy with the two economic giants china and india for their increasing requirements for these industrial products .

women storm the us real estate sector but men make larger profits

women storm the us real estate sector but men make larger profits
mohammed al-khinaifer from riyadh
29 / 10 / 2005
a recently published study showed that although the percentage of women working in the us commercial real estate sector in the past five years has increased , they receive a lower income and wages and get promoted more slowly than their male counterparts .
a united states - wide survey prepared by the network of commercial real estate women showed that the number of women working in the commercial real estate sector has increased from 32 % to 36 % since 2000 .
the network of commercial real estate women president ginger bryant commented on the results by saying that it is a noticeable and significant percentage , but that this progress has not yet spread equally across the us real estate sector .
brett white , the executive director of cb richard ellis and a participant in the research said that this is considered the first comprehensive research of this type into the conditions of women working in the us commercial real estate sector .
he continued saying that the results of the survey are a measurement and the standard for measuring the future progress for women working in real estate , whether in the percentage of their representation in the sector or the progress they make in their careers .
it is worth mentioning that women are achieving quick and widespread progress in other sectors such as accounting , law , and marketing , as mentioned by mrs. ginger ,
as working women constitute 44 % of the above - mentioned sectors , up from 37 % five years ago .
as for real estate agents , women constituted 23 % of the profession , whereas they constituted 20 % five years ago ,
but the results show that men continue to control and dominate this sector , known for the high commissions that are a part of it .
beth zeitzer , president of r . o . i properties commented on the control men have over the real estate sector , saying that five years ago the world of real estate agents was fully inhabited by men and it was very difficult for women to enter it or even find acceptance in it . today , however , real estate companies can be found who have a woman or more in their staff .
among the 1,834 persons surveyed , more than a third of men and women said they were able to make more than 150,000 dollars in 2004 ,
while 18 % said they made more than 250,000 dollars . in this category , 58 % said their income reached 150,000 dollars or more ,
but only 24 % of women stated that they made the same income , while both sexes pointed out to there being an obvious income gap between the two .
leadership is for men , while deputization is for women
the study showed that from the point of view of real estate experience of over 20 years in the field , 44 % of males have the title of president or executive director of a real estate company , while 23 % of women hold such positions , while real estate women have a high probability of getting the deputy president position or lower .
ginger bryant says , " despite their happiness at seeing more women employed in the commercial real estate sector , which men controlled for a long time , we would like to know why women are not holding top positions despite being as equally able as men .
i would hate to think that this is some form of unofficial policy forced upon women to prevent them from obtaining top positions . "
female real estate employees in the city of phoenix expressed their optimism about the near future which indicates favorably that women will progress in commercial real estate careers .
cindy cook , a real estate agent with colliers international , says that as women 's knowledge of the opportunities available in commercial real estate increases , one will see an increase in women choosing this profession .
both men and women working in the commercial real estate sector expressed their dissatisfaction with their work - life balance as contrasted with the level of professional success attained by them .
single women own 20 % of homes .
on the other hand , statistics published by the greater nashville association of realtors in the city of nashville showed that single women constitute 20.7 % of home buyers , while the percentage of men has reached 7.8 % .
in the 70s and 80s it was not common and widespread for women to own their own homes .
the phenomenon of women owning their homes came to attention in the early nineties .
women no longer expect the arrival of their husbands to make decisions on their behalf , especially when a woman is financially well off .
real estate agent aaron armstrong says that single women buy land and real estate property to lease it , as they see it a good and risk - free investment .

saudi arabia 's accession to the world trade
geneva
on friday , saudi arabia , the largest exporter of oil in the world obtained official approval to join the world trade organization and it is expected that accession will be completed by mid - december . after 12 years of difficult negotiations , the general council of the organization approved the decision of the organization 's accession committee stating that saudi arabia complied with all the membership conditions .
the council 's approval is an expected formality that will pave the way for saudi arabia , in its capacity as a full member , to participate in the important ministerial meeting to be held by the organization in hong kong in december , if riyadh completes the formal accession procedures quickly , bringing the number of organization members to 149 states , according to reuters .
it is likely that the accession of saudi arabia to the membership of the organization will open up its long - protected economy to the outside world , and the prices of shares on the saudi market - the biggest arab share market - have jumped to record highs as a result of the optimism in economic growth since the membership committee announced the completion of the accession negotiations on 28 october .
the number of members has thus become 149 states and the long and difficult negotiations between the organization and saudi arabia have ended in the ratification of 38 bilateral agreements on commodities and services that relate to market access .
the director - general of the world trade organization wto , pascal lamy , welcomed the accession of saudi arabia , saying it was a very important step .
it is likely that the accession of saudi arabia to the membership of the organization will open up its long - protected economy to the outside world .
women need commercial education to change their understanding of life

women need commercial education to change their understanding of life
sarah mavrinac

imagine a young university student took out a credit card and amassed a debt of 3000 american dollars on it .
imagine that the interest on that credit card was 19.8 % .
now stop imagining . if she had that initial balance and interest rate and payment plan , it would take her a total of 39 years to repay that debt . at the end of those years , she would have paid out 10,000 dollars in interest on a 3,000 dollars balance .
this is one of the examples for the reason why for every woman , rich or poor , old or young , married or not , with children or without , financial education is the means through which we acquire the skills and confidence to control our lives . it can help all women better understand their choices and the cost of those choices . and it can help women develop the skills that will allow them to make their choices more effectively .
in our life , there 's a fairly rich stream of literature that suggests that financial education for women would be a huge waste , because women , as these writings claim , are more cautious , less confident , and inferior to men in decision - making , problem - solving and leadership . but most of this research was conducted before 1980 .
more recent studies have shown that under equal circumstances , men and women have been found to be equally effective leaders , equally effective at achieving desired results under conditions of uncertainty , and equally capable of processing and reacting to information .
in other words , if women in general are more averse to financial risk and less confident than men , this has less to do with gender than it does with women 's relative poverty and lack of education .
when you have less money and you 're less well educated in how to manage it , you tend to take fewer risks with it .
since early spring 2004 , my colleagues and i have been trying to amass the statistical evidence that could give us a picture of how severe financial illiteracy is in asia . we 've been trying to understand which women it impacts most and how and when .
unfortunately , the statistics on financial literacy in the asia pacific region are very few .
unlike the united states , most countries in the asia pacific region - with the exception of australia - haven 't yet invested in empirical studies which could provide direct evidence of financial literacy levels . so we did two things . first , we invested in the first pan - asia survey on the issue .
although our sample is not representative of the population , it constitutes a cross - section of men and women , businesspeople and academics , homemakers and not for profit organization leaders who live in the countries we are studying .
we asked our respondents to consider the state of financial illiteracy in their countries and the resulting need for financial education .
we asked them to identify the financial skills that are most needed by women .
and , we asked them about how best to deliver financial education .
we received a response rate of 25 % on the survey , indicative of how significant the topic is .
we then studied other indicators of financial insecurity in the region .
we couldn 't get statistics on financial literacy itself , but it is possible that the greater the financial instability or insecurity in the region , the greater the need for financial education . so we compiled data on the levels of economic activity and growth and volatility in the region . we also compiled available statistics on household debts and savings , and reviewed the national pension systems in place in the asia pacific region , because if pension schemes are inadequate the need for financial education increases .
i will focus here on our main findings , because strong as we found the case to be for financial education generally , it is especially so for women in the asia pacific region .
why ?
first of all , financial insecurity for women in the asia pacific region generally is greater than that of men , taking into consideration retirement plans and participation in government pension schemes .
in general , government retirement schemes are improving , but their coverage and payout levels are still woefully low .
these coverage levels are low in part because nearly all the schemes are based on the presumption of employment in the formal sector . because an estimated 40 % of asian women are employed in the informal sector , they are automatically excluded from such programs . those who are covered tend to receive significantly lower benefits than men , because women earn less for equivalent work outside the home , and face obstacles in their ability to earn an income as a result of child - rearing or other care duties .
it is not a coincidence that over 90 % of our respondents believe that saving for retirement should be a priority for middle income women . about 60 % say the same for poor women and young women .
the statistics on women in poverty , no matter how familiar they have become , are still shocking . women and girls comprise an estimated 70 % of the world 's poor and the number of women in rural areas who live in poverty has increased by half over the last 20 years .
these desperate facts apply especially in asia , where more than 20 % of asia 's population lives in extreme poverty on less than one american dollar per day ;
there are almost 2 billion people in the region who survive on less than 2 dollars per day . india is home to an estimated 800 million of these people .
these poor constitute a third of the thai population , 40 % of the philippines population , and 50 % of the indonesian population .
the respondents to our survey believe that financial education is necessary to the very poor as well . some 70 % told us that the money management skills of women in poverty are poor or very poor . they consider this situation to be extremely serious .
in china , women now own a third of all small - and medium sized businesses .
the case for investment in financial education for chinese women is made still more poignant by the fact that they are a power that has proved its effectiveness in the availability of jobs .
in china , women now own a third of all small - and medium sized businesses . more than one in five women - owned businesses there employ more than 1,000 workers .
apparently , these women owned business now create almost one - fifth of all new jobs in australia .
investment in women 's financial skills will increase the vitality of these projects . what is less clear is that it will affect the role of women as care providers .
according to the jumpstart coalition for personal financial literacy , mothers and stepmothers are more than twice as likely as men to actively teach their children money skills .
how much more might we expect if all women were also financially literate ?
but how do we know that such financial education is successful ?
there is much data to prove that many people actually do change the way they manage their money after participating in an educational program .
studies looking specifically at retirement savings conclude that total portfolio accumulations and savings rates are indeed higher for workers whose employers offered financial education .
an evaluation by the national endowment for financial education of its high school financial planning program showed that nearly 30 percent of students started to save as a consequence of the training while another 15 percent started saving more .
a second study deduced that these changes in behavior are lasting .
it seems that young adults who receive financial education and who change their savings behavior seem to maintain that discipline well into adulthood . and it is not simply savings behavior that changes ; confidence levels and attitudes towards money management improve as well .
only three months after the completion of a women 's financial education program , it seems that participation has improved their cash management practices .
in singapore , an asian country that i know well , the government is playing a leading role in spearheading the country 's drive to promote financial literacy .
we must think creatively both about how we design and improve future programs .
our survey respondents believe that the costs of these programs might put them out of reach for poor women .
and they are clear in saying that we must find ways to fit these programs into the schedules of busy mothers and working women ,
they suggest we must be attentive to the cultural biases that influence women 's - and their husband 's - responses at these courses .
over 80 % of our respondents from india believe these biases are extremely
amartya sen , the noble prize winning economist has created the new capabilities perspective on poverty and human development that now informs the work of the united nations and the world bank .
in contrast with the more traditional monetary perspective on poverty , sen 's capabilities approach suggests that increased income is valuable only to the extent that it also enhances the capabilities of individuals to function and succeed in life .
these capabilities include , for example , the ability to lead a full and long life , to maintain one 's vitality and health , to move without restraint from place to place , and to productively read , write and perform numerical tasks .
in today 's increasingly complex financial and consumer marketplace , all people must have a basic understanding of how to control their money . to this list , we could add the basic ability to manage one 's income and savings . it is a fundamental ability and certainly transcends basic numeracy .
in today 's increasingly complex financial and consumer marketplace , all women - all people - must have a basic understanding of how to control their money and make effective use of even the limited financial services that are on offer .
and , as advanced communications and computing technologies spread more evenly and deeply throughout even the poorest communities , we cannot pretend that sophisticated financial and banking technologies will not soon follow .
of course , these new services have the potential to create enormous utility gains for those who wield them effectively , but that effective use cannot come without some form of education .
the role of educational institutions such as insead in this is obvious .
as experienced educators , we can provide the important practical learning tools necessary for the basic training programs .
as specialists in administration and corporations we can provide a vision on how to manage even the limited resources available to strengthen and support exciting change .
as a specialized institution for developing our global community we could act as supporters for community initiatives such as this , and help get the attention , talent and necessary resources for this effort .
so that women in current society can develop , some abilities in financial management are not just a merit but are basic and necessary life skills .
in the asia pacific region , women are a huge and valuable but largely unexploited resource . with education , and the appropriate tools , there will be no limits to what they could achieve for themselves and their region .

al-shubaily celebrates eid in hail with a corniche valued at 400 million
al-shubaily celebrates eid in hail with a corniche valued at 400 million
khalid al-rubaish from riyadh
10 / 19 / 2005
the khalid saud al-shubaily group has completed all the development work for the hail corniche , which cost nearly 400 million riyals and is expected to go on the market in the next few days .
khalid saud al-shubaily , the ceo of the group , said that the project represents the first stage of a venture comprising 160 residential and 120 commercial units . he pointed out that the project which is characterized by a very high level of development has all the services available as befits the quality of developments for which the group is known in all its projects distributed over the kingdom .
he added that the group was careful from the start to retain the distinctiveness of the project site close to the valley , as well as the area 's geological nature which was developed and modified to fit the prerequisites of the project and the direction taken by the group in changing the district into a residential / tourist / commercial product that would serve the hail region , and adopt schemes that concur with our project 's vision .
khalid al-shubaily said that sales in the project , located in the best part of hail , between the airport road , circular road and medina road , will be through a quota system carried out by the office built on the site by the group . he pointed out that sales will continue throughout the eid holiday thus providing an opportunity to visitors to the area wishing to own property in the project .
al-shubaily expects that the project will attract high - quality residential , entertainment and commercial investment projects through the establishment of small hotels and elegant apartments . by allowing them to benefit from the natural potential the project has to offer , it will certainly attract those residents of hail who are currently living elsewhere and wish to set up holiday apartments .
the project also attracts tourism investment projects to the green - covered valley .
al-shubaily , in his statement to al-iqtissadiya , refused to specify an upper ceiling on sales , saying that the market will determine the prices in comparison to nearby districts - such as the jamieen district - but stressed that the group will not sell at high prices and promised that the prices will be a surprise for everyone , especially young people , who wish to settle and build their family home .
putting the " hail corniche " up for sale complements a set of the group 's already completed and sold projects , the last being the high rise project sold in two stages - the first for shareholders and the second through an international auction held at the project headquarters early last summer .
the corniche project , completed in record time and at high levels of development , is considered the first of the group 's projects outside the eastern province to be offered for sale .
al-iqtissadiya learned that it was the first among other projects presented in the next few days , and offered for sale as soon as development work is completed in mecca , jeddah and riyadh .
thousands of women in the kingdom work from home

thousands of women in the kingdom work from homes
awatif hassan from dammam

the phenomenon of working from home has spread lately in many countries of the world . this area is supported by states through legislation that facilitates measures permitting women to work from their homes enabled by modern technology . they also have procedures for registering businesses that are run from home and provide insurance and protection to them against fraud and infringements of business rights , in addition to issuing them with licenses and collecting taxes accordingly , especially as the results of certain home businesses are high and generate high profits .
dr. nasreen saad al-dossari , director of al-qada center for management consulting , said that managing businesses from home is characterized by personal freedom , emotional wellbeing and financial gain , all of which are attained by women working from their homes , in addition to the ideal investment of time , availability of safety and adaptation of work to the special circumstances of some women .
she explained that despite there being no statistics as to the number of saudi women working from home , since a large percentage of them did not register their business or obtain work permits , reality confirms that there are no less than 10,000 women working from home in various fields , the most important being food preparation , sewing and various handicrafts .
dr. nasreen al-dossari explained that this category appeared for two main reasons , scarcity of jobs available for saudi women and the suitability of working from home in the local social circumstances .
a number of factors encourage saudi women to enter the home - business sector , the most important being that there is no need to comply with specific working hours and no need for women to travel from one place to another . in addition it enables women to practice the work they are adept at and want to do without restricting them to a particular timeframe for completion , and the flexibility to change the type of work if they find another area suited to their capabilities .
nasreen pointed out that studies dealing with the employment market in the kingdom stress the importance of women 's home - businesses on account of the scarce availability of opportunities for work in offices vis - sa - vis the annual increase in job applications .
she said that the percentage of employed saudi women does not exceed 5.5 % of the 4 million work - able women . the percentage of saudi women working in the various economic sectors comprises 12 % of the total saudi workforce in these sectors and it is expected that this number will rise in the future because of the increased number of university graduates of which there are an estimated 70,000 per year .
according to the latest estimation made by the ministry of planning , the female workforce increases annually by 4.8 % in comparison to the 3.9 % increase for males .
it should be mentioned that the program how to start your business points women , regardless of age , education and experience categories , towards starting ventures from home .
the program , presented by the al-qada center for management consulting comprises intensive lectures focusing on self - development skills , the capabilities required to develop the project idea , characteristics of home - businesses and fundamentals of success in a home business , simplified principles of feasibility studies , the basis for preparing a business plan and successfully managing a business , market research , and selling and marketing skills , in addition to a technical plan for starting a home - based business , financial management , financial planning and record keeping methods , use of the internet , computers and work ethics .
the program includes a practical application of the program 's curriculum and the preparation of a complete business plan by each trainee during the training period . the theoretical program is succeeded by a 12 - week follow - up period that comprises working on the implementation of the trainees ' plans and initiating the execution of their plans while attempting to assist in removing any obstacles they might face .

the world trade organization and the trading system offer a range of advantages and benefits , some of them well - known and others not so obvious , since the organization strives to create a more peaceful world from the money we have , the goods we use and the services we enjoy .
the world is very complex :
this text explains some of the advantages of the world trade organization trading system , but the text does not claim that the system is defect - free because if it was there would be no further need for negotiations and talks and for the established rules to be reviewed so that they are continually developed and improved .
nor can it be said that everyone agrees with everything about the world trade organization .
this may be one of the most important reasons for having the system : it is a forum in which countries discuss their opinions and differences on trade issues .
this means that there are many reasons that make the presence of the system an advantage over its absence . the ten advantages of having a world trade system are :
the system helps strengthen and support peace .
disputes are treated constructively
the creation of principles and rules makes life easier for everyone .
the freer trade system lowers the cost of living .
the freer trade system provides for wider choices in products and their quality .
free trade increases income .
free trade stimulates economic growth .
the basic rules and principles of trade make life more meaningful and useful .
the free trade system protects governments from the presence of factionalism and lobbies .
the free trade system promotes strong governments .

underwear market in saudi arabia valued at 1 billion riyals
mohammed al-hilali from jeddah
07 / 11 / 2005
the demand for underwear garments has registered a huge increase , exceeding last year 's demand by more than 7 % .
merchants and observers of purchasing activities in the domestic market said that the demand for male underwear garments increased noticeably during the second half of this year ,
leading many importers to increase their bank credit to cover overseas orders . at the same time , retailers pointed out that the demand for male underwear garments has increased noticeably in comparison to the demand in the previous two years 2003 and 2004 .
according to rashid al-fawzan , an economic analyst and businessman specializing in the garment trade , the underwear market has become seasonal , for example , during holidays , celebrations and the start of the new school year .
al-fawzan estimates the growth rate of the saudi underwear market in the past 5 years as between 5 % to 8 % , reflecting the 38 % increase in population growth .
al-fawzan also estimated the size of the saudi male underwear market at 800 million to a billion riyals .
the amount spent by consumers depends on individual income and personal expenditure from 3 to 4 times a year .
al-fawzan added that there are many different underwear garments , and that the quality ranges from high to medium to low , evaluated in the markets based on goods from south asia , for example pakistan and vietnam , at 30 to 50 marks .
these are followed by taiwan , whose garment quality is based on japan and korea .
this in turn is followed by the european markets where the quality of markets is better but expensive .
80 % of underwear garments on the saudi market are from east asian countries .
al-fawzan explained that the egyptian market for underwear production is growing slowly and that for the consumer it constitutes the best materials .
al-fawzan said that 90 % of consumers do not distinguish between the quality of international brands , due to the lack of awareness among consumers ,
since some brands state that the product is 100 % cotton , whereas it is not so .
there are goods manufactured in east asian countries and shipped to european countries where they get printed and branded and then imported as european goods .
al-fawzan warned that this is a dangerous procedure and can adversely affect the skin , causing allergies and redness .

intensive courses organized by the ministry of labor start tomorrow and are presented by specialists with the aim of opening women 's offices soon
an intensive program for training female staff to work in the women 's employment offices soon to be opened in riyadh , jeddah and dammam is starting tomorrow .
the general director for planning and administrative development at the ministry of labor , osman al-hugail , explained that the program consists of lectures on the functions of the employment offices , followed by a three - week course in computers .
he pointed out that these offices for women are expected to be made available in various parts of the kingdom , and aim to accept employment applications and finalize recruitment procedures , in addition to inspection and administration of the women 's labor sector .
al-hugail added that a chosen experienced elite of the ministry 's staff will train the female staff at the training centers of the chambers of commerce and industry via closed circuit tv . he pointed out that this action aims at activating the royal directive to establish women 's offices at the directorates and ministries , so as to allow women to finalize their business easily .
sarah saleh al-musabi , a graduate in general administration , commented on the step by saying that its importance lies in its provision of work opportunities to women away from the exploitation of some private employment offices .
um turki , a bank worker , has found a " solution " to her problems in recruiting home workers in this development , as she said , " without embarrassing my male relatives or being exploited by some public employment offices . "
um turki , who is separated from her husband , said that " a single procedure in the hands of some contractors transforms into a number of procedures to increase the fees they charge . " " when i carry out the recruitment procedures myself , " she added , " i will save the money i pay to the contractor and can spend it on my children 's needs . "
sarah al-arfaj , who studies networking technology at a private institute , believes that the women 's employment offices will save her the trouble of looking for a job suited to her qualifications , instead of being forced to travel between companies and workplaces and follow job advertisements in daily papers , as " this is a financial burden not all job - seeking women can afford . "
housewife um ibrahim , also a divorcee and a mother of a disabled child , describes the opening of the women 's employment offices as " a service needed by many women on account of their special situations , to shorten those procedures that require follow - up by a man . "
reem ahmed , a mathematics graduate , hopes such offices will open in all government bodies " because women understand other women 's requirements and conditions . "
she describes the difficulty men have in understanding the requirements a businesswoman will have for employees as " the reason " for the large number of workers who come to learn from us , instead of recruiting high - quality workers who can pass on their expertise to young saudi women .

developing saudi - russian economic relations
the moscow correspondent of the saudi al-riyadh paper quoted vladimir evtushenkov , chairman of the russian - arab business council as praising the depth of economic relations between the kingdom of saudi arabia and the russian federation , and the progress and cooperation it witnessed , especially after the historic visit of the custodian of the two mosques king abdullah bin abdul aziz al-saud to moscow during the last year , which resulted in cooperation in many aspects and fields .
he said relations between the two countries have reached a working stage since the stage of sharing information and consultation ended and we are now starting to achieve the results which were planned by the leaders of both countries .
he added , " there are positive indicators shown in the agreement and convergence of opinions and positions in many economic areas on the regional level or the international level ; the unified vision of continual progress in economic interaction towards the achievement of joint interests which are considered the most important basis for continual cooperation and the recently increased activity between the two countries , in their capacity as the world 's two largest oil producers and exporters in the field of keeping the price of oil in international markets within limits that are more suitable for both consumers and producers . "
he said , " all these positive indicators will help to achieve the aspired goals , " adding that the kingdom is always at the forefront of interests and praising the great respect shown by the kingdom 's residents to the russian federation .
he said , " the kingdom is witnessing rapid growth in the financial market and the establishment of large financial centers . it is expected to become an important commercial and financial center on both the regional and international scenes , and especially so after having joined the world trade organization , as it is one of the largest investment activity centers and has a developed financial market . he stated that giving the russian lukoil company the opportunity to develop saudi gas fields and gas condensates , and the russian company stroytransgas the opportunity to prepare the blueprint for the gas distribution network in the saudi kingdom and establish a new network for gas distribution in the city of riyadh , have both contributed to propelling these relations and developing them .
he added that the kingdom of saudi arabia represents a distinct case and expressed his happiness at the readiness expressed by a number of saudi businessmen to invest their money in russian aviation and space technology .
in the last two days , moscow has hosted a large number of representatives of oil and gas companies , energy companies , companies working in the petrochemical manufacturing sector , and many economic experts and scientists from russia and many countries of the world , including arab ones , who participated in the fifth russian oil and gas week activities .
a special session on russian cooperation with the middle and far east and africa in the area of oil and gas was held as part of of the week .
during the session held on moscow 's relations with middle eastern and north african countries , the director of the russian energy agency sergei oganesyan said in this context that these were old relations whose history dates to the time of the soviet union . they declined since the early 1990s after the break up of the soviet union , when russia started to rebuild the bases of its economy ,
stating that this decline has now become history as can be evidenced , for example , by the resumption of relations by russian companies almost all over the world , including the middle and far east and africa .
he added that the participation of the russian lukoil company in developing saudi gas fields and gas condensates is very important in this area , while the russian company stroytransgas is participating in preparing the blueprint for the gas distribution network in the saudi kingdom and in establishing a new network for gas distribution in the city of riyadh .
oganesyan mentioned that the gazprom company participates in equipping certain sectors in the gas field in southern persia ( iran ) and is researching one of the proposed routes for a gas pipeline from iran to pakistan ,
the stroytransgas company is also building a 403 km long oil transport pipeline in algeria from haoud el hamra to arzew , two russian companies have discovered two gas fields in sector 245 in algeria , and lukoil company is exploring and extracting oil in egypt .
stroytransgas is continuing the project of establishing a 370 km oil pipeline in sudan , from melut to basin .
oganesyan said that these and other russian oil companies are ready to enter into widespread cooperation with countries in the region , in the areas of exploration operations , developing uncovered hydrocarbon reserves , the provision of necessary equipment and marketing the products .
furthermore , a number of arab participants in the fifth russian oil and gas week activities confirmed that russia and arab countries have cooperated successfully in drilling and extracting hydrocarbons for a long period of time .
lukoil is considered an important partner in oil and gas production in a number of arab countries , while gazprom and a number of arab oil and gas companies have made important steps towards cooperation .
they added that the russian companies have a large opportunity to work in arab countries in the fields of excavation and extraction of gas and oil , establishing petrochemical plants , oil refineries and developing the gas network .
russian oil and gas companies have privileges that other foreign companies don 't enjoy , because they have long experiences in working with the arab world , in addition to russia 's geographic proximity to the arab world . for this reason , arabs invite russian companies to work in the oil and gas sector in the middle east .
they pointed out that attending this seminar in moscow proves their desire to strengthen working relations with their russian partners and make them participate in developing the natural resources in the region .
mrs. tatyana gvilava , director of the russian - arab business council , said that among the active partners of the council are seven russian oil and gas companies including soyuzneftegaz operating in syria , stroytransgas which has lately won a contract to lay a 324km gas pipeline in syria , and gazneft which operates in libya and syria .
she added that the russian - arab business council will organize the fuel 2006 exhibition in abu dhabi between the 4th and 6th february 2006 in cooperation with the united arab emirates chamber of commerce and industry and that the organizers are inviting russian oil companies to participate in this exhibition .

riyadh : the first women 's gold and jewelry exhibition is launched next saturday
03 / 12 / 2005
next saturday , riyadh will see the launch of a women 's gold , jewelry and expensive watches exhibition to be held at the four seasons hotel over four days under the sponsorship of the world gold council and two companies , mobily and rolls royce , and the participation of a number of local companies and factories , government and private bodies and a group of saudi women designers .
the exhibition is being held after the closure of the bahrain jewelry exhibition last sunday amidst wide saudi participation .
abdel rahman al-mahous , the executive director of the delta pro company organising the exhibition , estimated the number of visitors at the riyadh exhibition at about 30,000 women ,
pointing out that the value of exhibits exceeds 150 million riyals , and are all subject to strict guard by male and female security staff from a certified security company .
the launch of the exhibition coincides with a 14 % increase in demand for gold in the kingdom weight - wise , thus reaching 39.4 tons , and by more than 27 % value - wise reaching 639 million dollars in the third quarter of this year in comparison to the same period last year , as data from the world gold council shows .
in its report , the council mentions that its marketing and promotional activities in the gulf have continued to strengthen the growth in the demand for gold which has continued since the beginning of this year ,
showing that the first women gold and jewelry exhibition is the first certified women - only exhibition in riyadh , and major local , gulf and international gold and jewelry companies are participating in it , exhibiting the most modern designs and models of gold and jewelry , and its visitors are restricted to women only .
the council 's report mentioned that women constitute 49 % of the kingdom 's population and 35 % of the workforce in the public sector .
al-mahous explained that the exhibition 's opening day was set aside for invited society ladies and businesswomen ,
and that approximately 5,000 women will be invited to attend the opening on the first day , after which the invitation will be opened to the general female public for the rest of the exhibition .
he confirmed that unaccredited companies and merchants , or smugglers intruding on the gold market were banned from participating .
he explained that the exhibition will be accompanied by a major advertising and media campaign covering television , radio , electronic screens and press bulletins aimed at encouraging women to attend the exhibition .
al-mahous said that it was expected that a number of shops and factories participating in the exhibition will announce the presentation of new models for the first time in the saudi market , and also announce big offers and discounts for the exhibition .
also during the exhibition business projects will be unveiled and announced for the first time in local and foreign markets .
mohamed yousef naghi motors , the agent for rolls royce and bmw in the kingdom , will also showcase the 2006 rolls royce model at the exhibition .
al-mahous explained that indicators of women 's activity in the kingdom confirm the importance of holding specialized exhibitions for women as befits the exhibition sector and to move towards giving woman a main role in development ,
mentioning that women 's exhibitions expose women to what concerns them in the sectors of trade and industry , and the world of cosmetics and beauty .
he said that holding specialized exhibitions in which both the visitors and exhibitors are female only is in keeping with the nature of saudi society and coincides with the government 's directive to limit employment in shops selling female necessities to women - only within a specified time schedule .
for her part , the deputy executive director of delta pro nahid al-rashidi said that the internal preparations for the exhibition have been completed ,
and all female staff at the exhibition are trained ,
while currently invitations to visit the exhibition are being distributed .
she mentioned that various jewelry and golden ornaments specially ordered for the exhibition will be showcased ,
and gifts will be distributed to the visitors by some of the participants to advertise their new products .
she pointed out that the exhibition is considered an important event awaited by women , after the previous , uncertified exhibitions which were , as a result , not widely supported by advertising and the media , and therefore did not attract a large attendance from society ladies .
al-rashidi said that the gold and jewelry models that will be exhibited vary in price per piece from hundreds of riyals to 20 million riyals .
a number of participants will be entering the riyadh market for the very first time .

riyadh economic forum discloses the most recent field study on laws concerning women and the agencies implementing them
members of the women 's organizing committee at the riyadh economic forum mentioned that the chamber of commerce women 's branch , participating for the first time in the 2nd riyadh economic forum , had had a positive effect on highlighting women 's contributions to the forum . they expect more women to attend the forum this year and that there will be a wider discussion on women 's contribution to the economy .
the director of the women 's branch at the riyadh chamber of commerce , princess haila bint abdul rahman al-farhan , said that the chamber 's women 's branch helped a lot in making the forum 's women 's organizing committee 's efforts a success by holding 10 workshops that were attended by 200 women in preparation for the forum . she said that the women 's workshops discussed all the sessions of the forum and were not limited to session no . 7 focusing on women which dealt with the contribution of women to the economy .
princess haila mentioned that observers of the riyadh forum this year will see the difference in the women 's contribution and will notice that the actual participation of businesswomen has progressed . this is because the women 's branch is participating for the first time in the preparation of the forum , and has presented lists of businesswomen affiliated with the chamber to the organizing committee to assist in targeting the intended list . she expressed her hopes that women 's branches will be opened in all of the kingdom 's chambers given the role the women 's branch plays in serving women and their causes .
al-farhan stressed the role of the women 's branch at the chamber in providing services for women so that the forum is presented appropriately , and mentioned that devoting a single session to women - the session of women 's contribution to economy - does not mean limiting women to this session . instead , women are participating in all the sessions , because we all live in the same society . devoting a session to women evidences the authorities ' and the government 's interest in activating the role played by women in aspects of the economy and opening up opportunities to them .
during her talk , she demanded that women interact with the committee , express their opinions and participate , since in the end the goal is to make saudi woman reach the highest levels .
the director of the women 's branch in the riyadh chamber of commerce clarified that the forum will discuss a number of issues that will have an effect on activating the role of women in the future . she explained that the presence of a woman 's branch in riyadh 's chamber has greatly helped the committee to succeed in their task and provided them with information , as will be confirmed by the working papers discussed at the forum concerning the opening of women 's branches within governmental and relevant agencies .
the forum will be a historical reference for laws concerning the activation of the role of women and the bodies that implemented , or failed to implement , them .
she expressed her optimism that the recommendations presented in the study will contribute to the improvement of women 's participation in practice . " just as we participated in the forum for the first time through the women 's branch at the chamber of commerce , we will participate next year with new recommendations and new women 's branches that will empower women to contribute to their society in an effective and active way .

profits entice foreigners .
financial analyst mohammed ali yasin , director of the emirates commercial center , told al-iqtissadiya that the increase seen in the emirates financial markets since last year has enticed large numbers of investors from outside the emirates , specifically gulf - based investor , to enter the market and benefit from the opportunities available , especially as the market has achieved extraordinary profits for investors .
this is what has also enticed thousands of immigrant residents , arabs and foreigners , to enter the market and so we have seen large numbers of new investors entering the market with full force and this has contributed to the increased volume of trade .
he clarified that the number of saudi investors has increased hugely in comparison to their numbers last year , as large numbers have entered with huge sums of money and that has contributed to stimulating the market and increasing the number of shares .
they also participated strongly in preliminary underwritings in the emirates , the latest being the underwriting of dana gas which attracted thousands of saudis and other gulf residents .
the percentage of emirati investors on the dubai market decreased by more than 20 % ; up to last year they constituted approximately 89 % as compared to 12 % foreigners .
however , the unprecedented increase in the number of foreign investors attracted by the profits made from shares by many resulted in the decrease of local investors to 68 % .
yasin monitors the increase in the number of women in the dubai financial market and says that the number of women investors is also increasing like that of men , equally for emirati and immigrant investors ,
in addition to a noticeable increase in the number of gulf women , and specifically saudi women who are carefully opening accounts and establishing a presence in the emirati share market through their husbands .
he expects the coming period to see an increase in the numbers of foreign investors , specifically gulf residents who usually increase the tempo of their presence and investments on the emirates market as the financial year approaches its end and the time for companies to announce their profits for the current financial year approaches . this is the period that usually sees accelerated activity in the quantity of trading .
most of the shares also register a rise in prices because of intensifying speculation at this time of the year .
saudi businesswomen : love of affectation and fame , and combating saudization !

saudi businesswomen : love of affectation and fame , and combating saudization !
noora al-abdullah , riyadh
to the editor :
the past period has seen the appearance of a number of bright names of saudi businesswomen who have entered the business and economic sectors through their involvement in some business activities , or by establishing their own companies , institutions or establishments .
this appearance is a logical result of the economic , social and cultural development through which the kingdom is going through , and from which has emanated an increase in women 's interest in economics and her work in the economic sector . examples of this are participating in real estate and financial markets ( share markets ) , and others .
the latest research has shown that saudi women own a large share in many companies and that they own large amounts of liquid cash on the saudi , as well as the gulf , financial markets .
there is no doubt that we are all happy to see women enter the commercial business sector .
we wish to see successful , prominent and qualified saudi businesswomen , capably responsible for the women 's commercial business sector in ways that would benefit the saudi economy in general .
but we need to be more realistic and avoid compliments , by pointing to the current reality of saudi businesswomen , which suffers from a number of negative phenomena and observations , such as : 1 ) the dependence of many saudi businesswomen on non - saudi employees to run their businesses .
it is these employees who are actually doing the work , while the lady managers are content with signing and attending meetings .
2 ) the love of many businesswomen for social affectation , fame and luxury , and their entry into the business sector as a demonstration of social luxury and showing off , so that it can be said that mrs. so - and - so is a businesswoman and when she attends social occasions surrounded by the halo of her reputation , it is said that so - and - so has arrived .
they are at the moment nothing but glittering names behind which hides no real potential for the position and no main prerequisites for the duties of her job , and they have not achieved what their community is aspiring to in terms of services for saudi women and the saudi economy .
it is noticeable that many businesswomen combat saudization , and you will only find a few saudi female employees in the companies , institutions and commercial establishments owned by saudi businesswomen .
i heard many stories about young saudi women wanting to work in these companies and establishments who were not able to do so amidst the crowds of immigrant workers and their discrimination against them .
the most important observation is that many businesswomen have little competence and capability , since they don 't have the experience , qualifications and sufficient training to manage an establishment or a company , and this makes them dependent on directors who are in most cases of arab nationalities to subcontract management work to .
despite the many women 's activities and charity associations , it is noticeable how little saudi businesswomen support these activities and charity organizations , that despite the large sums of money owned by each businesswoman that imposes on them a religious and social duty towards their society .
no doubt my presentation of these comments is not a false accusation . there is no misunderstanding or a negative stance between me and any businesswoman ; i don 't even know any businesswomen personally . they are but observations i deduced from my watching their activities and from what i have heard from sisters .
there is no doubt that everyone asserts that women 's business activity will not succeed except in the presence of a new , educated and trained generation that will replace the current generation which , in my opinion , has wronged women 's business activity and damaged it more than it benefited it , making many draw an unrealistic picture of saudi businesswoman 's mentality , which is a shallow mentality .
in contrast to what we observe as the negative businesswomen 's performance aspects , there is hope that the women 's committee at the chamber of commerce will correct the situation , and hold meetings and forums that will target the improvement of standards among businesswomen , prepare them and develop their perception of business and economic activities .

property growth stage in saudi arabia
dubai - al arabiya net
the saudi property market is entering a new stage of strong growth and a boom in the establishment of huge real estate companies ,
with the market having lately witnessed the launch of 4 companies with a total capital of 27 billion riyals ( us $ 1 = 3.75sr ) .
it is expected that the companies will be opened as public joint stock to investors after fulfilling the conditions of the capital market authority .
the capital of the national real estate company amounts to 17 billion riyals , that of al-yamama real estate to around 5 billion , and that of tarabuh to 2 billion , the same as the almuttahed company .
sources from the real estate sector revealed to the london - based al-sharq al-awsat newspaper on saturday 03 / 12 / 2005 that the market will see the launch of other real estate companies , both closed and open joint stock , with attempts by some functioning companies to develop their operations , systems and work mechanisms so as to reach new operating levels on the stock market .
analysts say that the growth occurring in the stock market has enticed many developers to convert to closed joint stock companies and from there to public joint stock companies , and this defines a new means of communicating with small shareholders through dealing on the stock market instead of the old way of dealing through traditional real estate shares .
they pointed out that the new situation is better than the old one where the rights of many shareholders in traditional companies were lost .
the head of the national real estate company abdul rahman al-juraisi said that that the saudi market is characterized by the availability of good opportunities in the coming period , especially since saudi arabia has joined the world trade organization .
he pointed out that the founders of the company were careful to create a large property body aiming to give saudi citizens an opportunity to participate in it and benefit from its yielded revenue , as well as to meet the urgent need in the development sector and provide the areas required for the development of residential and industrial cities , provide citizens with housing suitable for their incomes and desires , provide appropriate housing and create jobs for the young and those of limited income , and meet the demand for real estate products .
on the other hand , the activities of the al-yamama company include the development and enhancement of residential , business and industrial projects , cash and purchase in installments and development of property on behalf of the company in addition to the maintenance of property on behalf of the company .
meanwhile the tarabuh company focuses on the purchase and development of real estate and the construction of buildings for investment through sales and leasing on the behalf of the company . it will also operate trade centers , hotels and furnished apartments .
almuttahed company will work in the areas of purchase , ownership and running hotels , investment in tourist areas , ownership and operation of real estate , and purchase and operation of ships , both for transport of passengers or goods .

this can be achieved by entering a civil status card number , which allows the system to directly contact the national information center at the ministry of interior and check if the entered data is correct , then forward the fees owed to complete the required transaction with the passport department . the corporation 's clients can in this way finalize payments from their homes or offices through the internet , or even from their cars through atms .
there will be no need to stand in queues and purchase manual coupons . instead , they will go straight to the riyadh passport department to complete the remaining procedures .
the process has been implemented in the riyadh region passport department , and shall be extended to the remaining passport departments in various regions of the kingdom .
the success of this large and leading project is the result of direct cooperation and ongoing follow - up by officials at the general passports directorate , the national information center at the ministry of interior , and officials from state revenue at the ministry of finance . al-rajhi banking corporation has thus added a new and distinguished national service to the bunch , one to be considered the most modern of its kind among the banking services in the middle east as well as internationally .
stage one of the e - government project included the payment of recruitment visa fees ( ministry of interior - labor recruitment office ) and insurance for driving licenses , as well as the fees for some councils and deposits .
stage two included direct automated payments with the benefit of enquiring beforehand about fees owing on passport transactions for residents and foreigners .
stage three included direct automated payment for traffic fines .
these projects complete the national role played by al-rajhi corporation , through which it strives to develop methods and ways for collecting government revenues through the implementation of state - of - the - art banking technology and direct online access .

a woman 's attractiveness and fertility show on her face . an increase in the female hormone estrogen makes women more attractive to men .
study : a woman 's attractiveness and fertility show on her face .
an increase in the female hormone estrogen makes women more attractive to men .
a woman 's attractiveness and fertility show on her face just as clearly as her nose and cheekbones . this is what researchers at the university of st . andrews said after studying the opinions of a group of volunteers , who were asked to evaluate the photos of 59 women between the ages of 19 and 25 years .
the aim was to explore the features of attractiveness , health and femininity in these women .
the photos were taken over a period of six weeks .
in each case , the scientists took laboratory samples from the women to analyze the levels of their sex hormones .
the results of the evaluation were compared with the levels of the hormone estrogen in the photographed women .
scientist found that the increase in the levels of this hormone in some women made male and female volunteers feel attracted to them , which means that they have a greater appeal to both sexes .
psychologist miriam lou smith who took part in the study said " women 's fertility shows clearly on their faces " .
" our results therefore explain men 's preferences for women 's faces , because they have more feminine characteristics compared to the faces of other women " .
she added that from an evolutionary point of view , it is clear that men prefer women who have the female characteristic of fertility , and who are able to bear offspring " .
the secretion of the hormone estrogen affects the shape of girls ' faces at puberty , especially as it contributes to the growth of bones and the texture of skin .
the increase in this hormone , leads to a more beautiful bone structure , and softer skin .
finally , the study showed that women 's use of beauty products disturbed the relationship between attractiveness and hormonal levels being studied , because make - up beautifies women and hides their natural features .

in the beginning there was the advertisement in " vogue " magazine in september , followed by a spectacular show at time square , organized during new york fashion week .
and today wal - mart , the largest low - price retail store in the united states , has launched " metro 7 " , a new clothing range inspired by the modern lifestyle , designed and made for that section of its female customers whom the retailer considers " fashion - connoisseurs " .
for wal - mart , however , " metro 7 " presents more than just an effort to modernize the image of affordable ladies ' clothing , previously designed for low - income , rural customers ,
after years of full commitment to the main value of its business , based on the slogan , " always low prices , always " , this new launch indicates a shift towards a new retail model :
asking its customers what they want .
karen stuckey who is responsible for apparel development , says that the idea of wal - mart 's " metro 7 " line emerged from a company study of 6000 customers during a research project launched in early 2004 .
the results indicated that a large number of customers wanted their shop to offer them more goods , " they want more modern fashion , contemporary styles ( . . . ) and we were not providing that " .
metro 7 is now a major brand in around 500 wal - mart stores , most of them in urban areas . it is also available on the company 's retail portal on the internet .
the brand will be updated monthly to keep up with new fashion . this will be partly through feedback from a " trend office " established at the heart of the fashion district in new york .
the launch of " metro 7 " is considered a fundamental change in the operation strategy of wal - mart . previously , wal - mart entrusted the task of customer research to their suppliers and carried it out traditionally , by choosing new brands to be launched in - store , then ordering more of these popular brands .
but as the national growth of wal - mart slows down , the retail store is trying to achieve larger profits using existing stores that saw a decrease in their sales volumes , especially in comparison with its smaller competitor " target " .
these efforts include convincing a large part of the millions of americans who visit the company 's stores annually , to target their spending on brands with higher profit margins such as clothing , homewares and electronics .
john fleming , head of marketing for wal - mart stores in the us says , " they buy soap , and they buy consumables or other basic products where price is the decisive factor " .
and until now we always had the assortment to meet their needs in areas such as clothing , home or electronics .
so our strategy is to use customer research and insight to establish a better understanding of our customers ' needs and to develop assortments that meet these needs " .
fleming ( 46 ) , took over as chief marketing officer at wal - mart in america last april , after he headed the expansion of wal - mart . com .
before joining " wal - mart " , he had spent 19 years with " target " .
target has become known as the biggest " up - market " discount store in the us and by adopting a skillful marketing technique and a handful of famous designers , it attracts customers to its clothing and furniture goods .
" target 's " sales have grown quicker than wal - mart 's this year ; it also has higher profit margins .
since fleming took up his position , wal - mart 's advertising style - which is developed by the gsd &amp; m agency , based in texas , a subsidiary of omnicom - has begun to resemble " target 's " advertising style .
the era of tv advertisements filmed inside stores , focusing on the slogan " low prices every day " is gone .
instead , the marketing campaign this autumn , included more metaphors and lifestyle images , using skillful production to present goods such as cube - shaped cd players .
however , fleming says that wal - mart is not target , pointing out that customers will come to wal - mart to change their tyres , to buy new glasses or to get their photos developed .
he adds : " i admire their approach of building the brand and their methods of marketing types of goods , nevertheless they occupy a different area than the one we are in .
he responds to claims that wal - mart is moving up - market , saying , " we are not trying to become more up - market , what we are doing is becoming more in tune with our existing customers , by providing more brand choices . marketing plays a major role in our ability to communicate this .
he continues saying , " this extensive drive , of always lower price ,
has not given us a chance to develop some of the business to the best possible capacity , because it was not resonating with customers .
there is a large group of customers who do not even consider us as a clothing source . these customers think differently in the way they plan on spending their income .
if you think about what reflects the urban lifestyle , it does not focus a lot on buying a car or owning a house , it is mostly focused on owning a luxury apartment and elegant clothes .
these customers spend their money differently .
the new marketing technique focuses on specific brands , determined through customer research . fleming says , however , that this does not require spending more money on marketing .
he adds , " at the moment we are working on developing a strategy that targets clothing lines specifically , such as metro 7 , or other specific projects in the area of electronics . this does not mean though that targets have to be local .
we do not need to spend a lot of money , we only need to be smarter in the way we communicate with our customers .
metro 7 will be promoted actively , through the new strategy of " brand focus " with more advertising in vogue magazine during november as well as other activities .
wal - mart is moving now with the memory of its mismanagement of the " george " clothing range . the range was put on the shelves in the united states without sufficient advertising , after wal - mart bought the british company asda , owner of the george range .
fleming said that he intends to focus on customer research and brand development to move beyond fashion into electronics and home furniture .
to achieve this objective , the company will establish a new marketing research unit within the existing marketing administration , moving a step away from the traditional discount store model .
the move towards market research influences wal - mart 's plans to provide a range of goods in its stores that meet the needs of local customers ; this is a growing trend within the retail store chain in the united states .
wal - mart has introduced the local component through the model of the " community store " , which gives store managers the opportunity to choose the merchandise offered to customers . stores in predominantly hispanic areas , for example , are provided with goods commonly used by local residents , in addition to providing ethnic food products ,
fleming also mentioned the idea of changing the colours and sizes of the clothing ranges according to the requirements of local customers , " we are examining the feasibility of this for the future " .

sixteen saudi businesswomen representing the eastern region and jeddah are taking part in a conference to be held tomorrow in sharm al-sheikh under the title : development and the future of arab investment and international cooperation . princess masha ' el bint faisal , member of the arab committee for women investors heads the saudi delegation to the conference , without the representation of businesswomen from riyadh and other regions .
nihad al-subei ' i , head of women 's affairs in the council of commercial and industrial chambers in riyadh , informed working woman that the saudi trade delegation is the first female delegation endorsed by the council of chambers to participate in foreign economic conferences .
she pointed out that this step is a new achievement for saudi women , increasing their ability to work and assume active economic roles .
al-subei ' i indicated that in the past businesswomen took part in foreign conferences and forums in an individual capacity .
each woman , she said , represented herself rather than her country .
however , the delegation to the conference whose proceedings start tomorrow , has the distinction of being the first official delegation of women formed from the saudi council of chambers .
she clarified that the absence of riyadh businesswomen from the delegation was due to the riyadh economic forum being held at the same time as the conference in sharm al-shaikh . the riyadh economic forum discusses local issues that are important to women .
she stated that the council is preparing to form other delegations from all regions to take part in future official functions and visits . the purpose of this participation is to increase cooperation and commercial exchanges between saudi businesswomen and their counterparts in other countries and to stimulate women 's investments .
princess masha ' ael bint faisal , head of the saudi delegation to the sharm al-shaikh conference , said that she will present a working paper on building entrepreneurial business and its effect on enabling work
the paper will include advice for achieving stability in commercial business , so that it is built on correct entrepreneurial bases , especially with the application of international business laws to saudi arabian establishments , after accession to the international organization .
princess masha ' el made it clear that forming the delegation goes along with saudi arabia 's accession to the world trade organization .
she said that most commercial businesses owned by saudi businesswomen fall under the category of small businesses , therefore they need correct entrepreneurial structures in order to operate correctly .
she revealed that another working paper will be presented to the conference , dealing with the role of trade chambers in increasing and activating women 's investments ,
and touching on the women 's branches in these trade chambers , and their role in presenting a positive image of saudi women .
the conference on " development and the future of arab investment and international cooperation " aims to promote investment , strengthen the integration of arab capital and take advantage of international expertise and technology .
the conference will also discuss investment projects in egypt and other arab countries , divided between the following sectors : textiles , clothing , agriculture , food industries , engineering , pharmaceuticals , chemicals , paper industry as well as service and tourism projects .
it is estimated that about 1400 delegates from all over the world will take part in the conference ; all participants will have a common interest in investment and development .
among the central themes of the conference are investigating ways to support women and empower them as essential partners in development ; strengthening arab cooperation and promoting it in europe , africa and internationally ; promoting the culture of peace as the main pillar for development and investment ; attracting arab funds held in foreign countries into development projects and developing inter - arab trade .

next monday , bahrain will be holding an educational course for arab media specialists , both men and women , about the image of women in the arab media . the two - day course is organized by the arab women 's organization in collaboration with the supreme council for women in bahrain , and will be under the patronage of shaikha sabeeka bin ibrahim al-khalifa , wife of the king of bahrain , chairwoman of the supreme council for women .
dr. lulua al-awadi , secretary of the arab women 's organization in bahrain , told working woman that more than 28 media specialists , both men and women , will participate in the course ; they were nominated by their governments as trainee specialists working in the media sector . a number of observers and representatives of the official sponsors will also attend the course .
five arab media experts were chosen as course instructors : gisele khoury from the al arabiya channel , raufa hassan a media expert from yemen , dr. hussein amin , dean of the department of mass communication at the american university in cairo , kuwaiti media personality yusuf al-jassim and bahraini journalist ismet al-musawi , a member of the supreme council of women .
the course will discuss a number of central topics including mass communication with arab women , dialogue or squabble ? , the influence of arab culture on media communication with women , new styles in media writing for journalism and television , relating to the role of women from the perspective of social stereotypes , the mental image of arab women and how the mass media deals with it , the importance of women 's political participation and its vital role in decision - making and frameworks for stimulating this role in the media .
al-awadi explained that even with the diversity of the mass media and the variety of programs and informational materials , women 's share is still limited in style as it is also limited in time slots and space .
she said , " we find that women 's programs are associated with childcare , family , decor , and beauty ; they rarely deal with general women issues , especially in connection with women 's participation in development " . she added that there is an aspect of fear or uncertainty when dealing with the issue of the arab woman as a development problem , therefore her portrayal in the arab media depends on the sponsoring bodies which are usually foreign organizations and groups .
al-awadi stated that it is necessary to deal with these issues along with other development topics and to strengthen the discussion around them , give them adequate space in the media , and present them impartially , away from political , cultural and social sensitivities . for this purpose , media specialists need to be guided towards these issues as defenders and supporters and subsequently , the media in its role as an essential and vital partner in change will carry the pace of the economic , cultural , social and political empowerment of women .
it was mentioned that the arab women 's organization is a governmental organization operating within the framework of the arab league . it was created as one of the league 's organizations according to the agreement of wives of arab kings , emirs , and arab presidents in the cairo declaration , issued by the first arab women summit held in cairo in november 2000 .
the agreement to establish the organization was implemented in march 2003 with 14 countries joining .
the organization has a supreme council , executive council and executive secretariat ; it aims to improve the status of arab women , raise awareness about the importance of their participation in the development of arab societies , and achieve a level of coordination and cooperation between member states in efforts to empower and enlighten women in all areas , especially education and health .

a number of female candidates in the jeddah chamber of commerce and industry elections previewed their election programs during a seminar entitled " the future of women in decision making " , which was organized
recently by the women 's cultural forum in jeddah .
the seminar , held at the flower garden in jeddah , was attended by liz cheney , daughter of the us vice president , assistant secretary of state for near eastern affairs , and head of the middle east partnership initiative ( mepi ) , who is currently visiting the kingdom .
the seminar witnessed the meeting of female candidates , from various election lists , who are campaigning for membership of the jeddah chamber of commerce board of directors .
the forum was attended by : the jeddah list , the awa ' el list and a list of independents represented by businesswoman hissa al-aun , in addition to businesswoman madhawi al-hassoun who has recently joined the al-mustaqbal ( future ) list .
businesswoman ulfat al-qabbani , owner of a perfume factory in jeddah , and one of the candidates for the jeddah chamber of commerce elections , reviewed her experience in industrial investment before an assembly of businesswomen .
she dealt with the challenges facing the industry sector in the kingdom of saudi arabia after accession to the world trade organization .
during the seminar , al-qabbani called for the use of the unemployed female workforce , by employing them in the industry sector .
one of the most important tasks in the current phase , as she sees it , is to attend to these wasted energies , by finding suitable working environments for women , that adapts to social conditions , and from then on to develop the infrastructure of the industrial city in jeddah .
she considered the establishment of a model all - women industrial city , provided with highly competent occupational training centers in different areas of expertise , as one of the proposed solutions to the problem of female unemployment .
she also called for replacing the male foreign work - force in the kingdom 's factories with saudi female personnel , especially in jobs that are suitable for women 's physical and technical abilities .
during the seminar , al-qabbani demanded the creation of a special reference authority for businesswomen ; this will become possible by organizing seminars , forums , and sub - committees under one official umbrella sponsored by a private or government entity with economic clout . among the main objectives of this authority are developing women 's capabilities in business administration , and reviewing new developments in the employment market .
ulfat al-qabbani warned that , after saudi arabia 's recent accession to the world trade organization , many small and medium businesses would be forced out of the saudi market if their performance was not developed accordingly . this happened in india and egypt and other member states of the organization .
she said that the kingdom has embarked on many structural reforms aimed at increasing the role of the industrial sector ; it has created a varied range of impartial general incentives and dispensations for all industrial establishments and companies .
nadia al-zuheir , a participant in the forum , said in her turn that the forum was established ten years ago to put forward and discuss scientific , religious , cultural and social issues , in order to promote thought and rebuild the role of the individual and society , with a focus on matters relating to women 's issues .
amjaad ridha , stated that the forum sheds light on successful economic experiments supporting the general steps of reform and development and not supporting specific groups in particular .
hinting that promoting these experiments , setting them up and making them successful will throw the door wide open to the wider participation of women in decision - making . this in turn will have an impact , through a significant development in the status of women , and through increasing the female ratio in the total workforce in the country .
amjaad ridha added that it is therefore not extraordinary , that the election programs of women candidates include demands for expanding and diversifying the working fields of businesswomen ; they also include the call for modernizing the regulations which govern the activities of businesswomen . these calls , she said , imply doubling national production , and present a solution to the problem of unemployment among women which stands at about 21 % according to the latest statistics .
she went on to say that calls for providing a favorable investment climate , and diverting women 's inactive bank savings towards supporting successful economic projects was called for in more than one election program .
this is especially relevant , when we know that there are 30,000 trade registrations for women in the kingdom , and that saudi businesswomen own 16 % of private companies , and a substantial percentage of real estate .
estimates of women 's saving in local banks vary between 15 and 40 billion riyals . this , in both estimates , is a large sum and should be active in investments that yield benefits to both investors and the economy .
during the forum , the female candidates also previewed their election programs .
the al-awael list introduced its election program under the title : activating and developing the role of women , an urgent necessity after the kingdom 's accession to the world trade organization .
the program was presented by media personality and businesswoman dunya bakr yunis .
another participant , mrs buthaina mumina waraqa presented a working paper entitled : promoting women in the economic and trade sectors .
mrs neshwa taher , from the jeddah list , also presented a working paper containing facts , figures and social responsibilities that encourage economic development .
while dr. lama al-suleiman addressed the forum in a speech , where she articulated the role of the jeddah 's chamber of commerce and industry in promoting women business owners .
in her turn , candidate madhawi al-hassoun said in her address that the women 's right to vote will activate saudi women 's role towards constructive contribution in driving further economic development . it will also cause a qualitative shift in women 's involvement in decision - making .
lastly , candidate hissa al-aun stated that in these elections she represents women investors in the small business sector

saudi families ' expenditures increase during eid
jeddah
saudi families recorded a big increase in expenditure and eid bills during the last days of ramadan , and the days of blessed eid al-fitr .
a report in the saudi newspaper okaz revealed that the average family 's expenses exceeded 12000 riyals , where they reported a spending of 3500 riyals on clothing according to the number of children , 2500 riyals on replacing furniture , 1800 riyals on confectionary and entertainment , 2750 riyals on banquets , and another 3000 riyals for other expenses such as trips or furnished flats .
dr mahmoud mohammed kasnawi , professor of social sciences commented on the expensive eid bills , saying that expenditure increases at the end of ramadan in preparation for the eid celebrations , and for buying clothing and other family necessities and requirements . some families also like to make new changes during ramadan by replacing and modernizing their furniture .
dr kasnawi revealed that banquets are also a drain on finances that cannot be controlled or avoided , since the social environment dictates holding banquets for family and friends . some families , who visit from other areas , incur high expenses in renting furnished flats , which in turn increase their expenses during the holiday season . all of these expenses are a drain on the individual 's income .
dr. kasnawi finished his statement by saying that the final days of ramadan and the days of eid cause a disruption to families ' budgets , especially families that spend without limits .

saudi companies move towards employing saudi women in real estate marketing
a member of the businesswomen 's group
national companies move toward employing saudi women in real estate marketing .
major saudi real estate companies are moving towards employing saudi women and designating entire female marketing administrations , according to economic studies .
this year , the value of real estate circulation between saudi women is estimated at over 2 billion riyals .
it is within this framework that the durrat al-khobar project , which offers different residential units from studios , apartments , and chalets to villas and palaces , has moved to employ 26 saudi women specializing in telephone , field and office marketing .
today 's edition of the saudi al-watan newspaper , reported that the marketers will work according to a monthly plan which each marketer will draw up herself , provided that it falls within the company 's general marketing strategy ;
this will empower the employees to be creative in their work ; it will also promote competition among new marketing staff .
inas al-hunti , manager of women 's marketing for the project , confirmed that the job requires specific abilities in addition to study and academic specialization ; the specialization , however , did not present a hindrance to saudi women employed for this job , and most new employees are graduates of humanities departments .
al-hunti , who is the only woman in the company with a marketing degree from the king abdulaziz university in jeddah , stressed the importance of giving women the opportunity to study marketing at the university of king saud in riyadh , since marketing is one of the major specializations suitable in the current employment market .
she pointed out that in order to correct this deficiency , the durrat al-khobar company has arranged intensive training courses for all employees . she said that women have the professional skills for dealing with people , they are also more tactful than men in understanding the client 's nature , and better than men in the art of conversation .
she also mentioned women 's ability to enter into society , and thus provide services for other women , so that female clients do not need to enlist help from the male section . this has driven many companies to make female personnel a major factor in promoting the success of their projects .
she indicated that the real estate market is going through a golden era , and the entry of women into the market now will yield great benefits for the market and for women .
telephone marketer majida al-ayyaf said , in her turn , that companies are capable of fulfilling saudi women 's career ambitions . she said that she holds a bachelor of history from the faculty of arts ; however , she has developed her abilities through training courses , especially the course she passed recently in telephone marketing at the saudi women information centre ( swic ) .
al-ayyaf answers the toll - free 800 number , responds to queries and explains the projects marketed by the women 's team .
haifa al-yusuf , real estate marketer , collects lists of targeted customers to save time and effort . she insists on her success in marketing although her academic qualification is in social work .
al-yusuf finds the job interesting and effective in building social relations ; it also provides employees with the necessary experience with different social strata . she wished she had a chance for university study in this subject in riyadh .

study : women make up 60 % of internet users in the kingdom .
rania al-qar ' awi from riyadh
29 / 10 / 2006
unofficial statistics published recently in the american magazine new woman revealed that women using the internet make up more than 60 % of total internet users in the kingdom .
the statistics mentioned that women use the internet to perform work tasks and run commercial businesses from their homes , since this suits women 's nature , in adhering to islamic values , which require them not to mingle with men ; it also suits women 's compelling need to remain at home and care for their families .
new woman magazine explained that the internet has helped saudi women to find a balance between the demands of work on one side and the customs of society on the other . it has contributed to the increase in the number of saudi women working in the private sector and helped women manage their own businesses from home .
another recent study has shown that women also form the majority of internet users in the usa and europe . a report issued by american company netsmart has recently shown that 58 % of new internet users are women .
e - commerce company emarketer revealed that women form 46 % of internet users in the united states .
meanwhile , the results of a study published by media matrix revealed that women constitute the majority of internet users . the study also revealed that usage patterns differ between both sexes ; women , the findings concluded , use the internet as a tool to accomplish specific goals ,
whereas men are more prone to spend hours in front of the monitor without searching for something in particular , and they generally surf from one site to the next until they find something of interest .
the same study indicated that european women know exactly what they want from the internet and how to get it . it also found that german women are the most mature in using the internet as a tool to simplify their lives .
about the sites most visited by women , the study found that women search for sites that offer health information and services , reference , tourism sites , reservations and email .
when shopping on the internet , women conduct a number of searches and comparisons before making a decision to buy . sites that captivate the interest of men , on the other hand , are news , sports , economy , investment and email sites ; they also show interest in other random sites or those inspired by current events .
the study concluded that , although women form the majority of internet users , their contribution to the field of computer programming is limited . the study recommended that women should double their efforts to get recognition for their technical skills .
the cabinet approves a bill regulating " tally trade "

the cabinet approves a bill regulating " tally trade "
cabinet approves a draft bill regulating " tally trade " , from company licensing to dispute resolution .
last night the cabinet presented a regulatory framework for the tally trade market in the kingdom , after it approved a draft bill for tally trade regulations . the cabinet had deliberated on this bill for almost three years , and its approval is a major step aimed at determining the exact procedures and the full dynamics of this market . the tally trade market had previously faced many obstacles , mainly delayed customer payments to companies active in this field .
the new regulation stipulates , as a condition for practicing tally trade , that all tally trade operations be conducted through companies or establishments licensed by the ministry of trade and industry . it also allows the seller to make a provision in the sale contract for a security or guarantee for payment , and against loss , to be held until the full payment of the selling price is collected . the regulation stipulates that the council of chambers of commerce and industry establish , under supervision from the ministry of trade , a centre for information related to the tally trade . the ministry of trade is to draft the bylaws regulating the operation and administration of this centre .
according to the tally trade draft regulation , of which al-riyadh obtained a preliminary draft copy as it came out of the shura council , the provisions of tally trade cited in this regulation do not apply to rental contracts that end in ownership .
the draft also stipulates that tally trade sale contracts be drawn up in at least two copies : one for each party . the contract should state the complete details of the buyer , seller and guarantors ; a complete description of sales items , prices , portion of the price advanced in cash , and the outstanding portion of the price , as well as the amount of payments installments , their due date , and the conditions for full price settlement . it also requires that the details about the seller and buyer be updated .
the regulation permits the buyer to collect an amount of no less than 10 % of the total sale price in installments upon delivery of the sales item , unless the buyer provides a security , or a guarantee of payment against loss and for performance .
the regulation stressed that any dispute between the two parties to the contract , would be referred to judicial authorities for resolution , according to jurisdiction . another clause in the regulation sets a fine of 100,000 riyals for professional tally traders found in breach of this regulation .
the penalty is doubled in cases of a second offense , with the possibility of a final closure order against the trading store for a period not exceeding six months . specialized committees will be formed by order of the minister of trade , to examine offenses and impose the penalties stipulated in the new regulation ; judgments will become final only after the date of the grievance expires , or when a final ruling from the grievance board is issued .
persons who have been issued with a penalty ruling against them , are entitled to present their grievance to the grievance board within 60 days of the notification of this ruling .
it is mentioned that the shura council deliberated on this draft for three years ; a special committee was formed to examine draft texts received from the council , and at the time the decision was made to accept the view of the riyadh chamber tally trade committee regarding the texts of the regulation .
khaled al-jasser , chairman of the tally trade committee in the chamber , confirmed two days ago to al-riyadh that one of the main problems facing tally trading companies working in the country , is the collection of late payments from customers , as it affects the collection of these companies ' outstanding debts , which in turn will delay the reinvestment of funds . he pointed out that there are many practical solutions for dealing with this problem , such as simplifying claims procedures which are carried out either by provision or through the courts , this will reduce the risk to companies facilitating the tally trade , and will have a positive effect in favor of the clients in cost - plus programs .

fighting financial corruption : an urgent requirement for a new era !

fighting financial corruption : an urgent requirement for a new era !
mohammed bin abdullah al-shareef .
17 / 10 / 2005
we have to admit at the outset that financial corruption is almost a universal phenomenon plaguing most countries except a precious few . in some cases it becomes an infestation of rot that eats through government and society , but it can also recede into insignificance , due to numerous factors , among them : the type of the government and whether it is democratic or dictatorial ,
transparency and public disclosure in matters of the economy and finance ,
methods of collecting and spending public funds ,
presence of monitoring bodies with the capability of detecting and revealing corruption and with the authority to bring to account and penalize .
further influencing factors are : levels of education , poverty , religious and ethical restraints and general awareness in society .
the presence or prevalence of corruption crimes can be noted in trade sector dealings , import operations , the procedure of dealings in government departments , the processing of cases in legal departments and even in dealings and general conduct between members of society ; it is also noted in the stories reported by the media . moreover , an independent international organization called transparency international rates countries according to the prevalence of integrity or corruption .
ratings are given through periodic reports , based on information and the constant monitoring of each country .
the most transparent countries are listed at the top of the report , while the most corrupt are at the bottom .
in many cases the rating matches what is known or reported about the situations in each country ,
to the extent that one can actually notice some elements of these ratings in the conduct of individuals within the masses of expatriates amongst us ,
and question , however fleetingly , the wisdom of our extensive recruitment from countries rated as the most tolerant to corruption , whose citizens automatically spread it through their dealings and conduct ,
and the crimes they commit .
i return now to the title of the article and our situation in the kingdom ,
i say , corruption is an existing and tangible phenomenon , according to what we see and hear , what is relayed in society , and through information reported in social clubs and the media .
the discussion of corruption begs the question , what is the extent of this phenomenon ?
has it reached a stage where it is difficult to treat ?
an impartial investigator into this question cannot help
but say that despite the noticeable aspects of corruption like nepotism , bribery , misuse of authority , misappropriation of public funds , favoritism , negligence , and the delays in processing and finalizing court cases , these aspects have not yet become chronic phenomena , especially as some of these aspects have infiltrated , as i said , into our society from external behavior patterns , in the absence of rules regulating many issues
or in the presence of outdated regulations that have become slack and full of loopholes .
there is a debate about the concept of corruption and its limits :
the interpretation of some goes to the extreme of limiting corruption to stealing from others and the belief that public funds are the property of everyone . this goes along with the popular saying , if it is not yours or your brother 's then it goes to the wolves . some use this saying as a justification to deceive themselves , and to deny the illegitimacy of their pilfering .
thus the use of government vehicles at home and for private purposes and receiving airline tickets and travel allowances without moving from the spot is not unlawful .
bribes are regarded as tips , favoritism turns into mediation , nepotism is in the vein of ' charity starts with the next of kin ' and taking over land is not stealing from anyone , because god 's earth is vast , and so on .
corruption is not restricted to overt actions , it involves and infiltrates many things , some of them are difficult or even impossible to expose .
for example , when an official overhauls and performs a full service on his government issued vehicle just before the end of its expected useful life , because he intends to buy it , as per the stipulated regulation for this ; leaking information about an official tender to interested parties , so that they can prepare and take preliminary steps for the required project , which guarantees them winning the tender , since no other parties will be able to meet requirements such as the timeframe ; these are difficult to expose .
there are other hidden methods of corruption , such as exaggerated office renovations and decorations , when there is no real need for them , changing cars and furniture ,
giving employees fictitious overtime tasks in order to use up funds allocated in the budget categories before the end of the financial year , so that the official has an excuse to request more funds for next year 's budget items .
there is a thin line between integrity and corruption ; it is a line connected to conscience , feelings of religious restraint , the spirit of citizenship , and concern for public interests .
even if we mobilize armies to monitor people , we will not be able to expose corruption or prevent it completely , as long as this thin line is blurred by the absence of conscience .
does everyone know for example that an authority like the general auditing bureau , which is in charge of monitoring public funds , annually exposes hundreds of millions spent illegally from government funds ?
this happens every year , without any punishment or trial for embezzlers or illegal spenders ,
a lot more remains undiscovered because , as i mentioned , corruption has numerous methods .
i heard once a contractor speaking at a social gathering ; he said and i quote , we are forced to submit tender offers at below cost prices ,
and when i asked him , how do you make a profit then ?
he said , we know how to make a profit !
from this answer , a na ? ve person concludes that the contractor delivers less than the required specifications to make a profit ,
and that he knows how to get them approved .
returning to the subject of office renovations ,
i remember my visit some time ago to the general accounting office gao , which is in charge of monitoring public funds .
i was struck by the simplicity and antiquity of the desk used by the general accountant himself ,
and my curiosity drove me to ask about it .
i was amazed when he told me that the office has not been changed in 20 years ,
the only thing that ever changed was the general accountant !
where are we on this ?
when an official in our country rushes to change everything in his office as soon as he gets appointed because he did not approve of his predecessor 's taste .
the problem and the major cause of increased corruption is the absence of accountability and punishment .
in the absence of accountability corruption thrives , grows and takes root ; the corrupt official feels confident that his deeds will never be exposed , and even if they were to be exposed nothing can happen to him .
many official have enriched themselves through abusing their positions and nothing ever happened to them .
i will mention here , only as a reminder , mrs. thatcher , former prime minister of britain , who is one of the most righteous administrators i knew .
when she went to hand in her resignation at the queen 's palace , she used the presidential vehicle , but she returned home in her private car .
and in canada , we saw in the news how the president and chief of the royal canadian mint was forced to resign along with aides after accusations of wasting large amounts in expenditures .
among the allegations was that he personally included the amount of one and a half dollars , the price of a packet of chewing gum , in his expenses .
similarly , his colleague , the immigration minister was subjected to criticism in parliament , because he spent 138 dollars on an official business lunch of pizza , where he discussed proposed improvements to the immigration system .
officials in developed countries are required to disclose their properties and assets before assuming their posts , to identify their assets and discourage them from enriching themselves through the privileges of their positions , otherwise they will be subject to inquiry .
in some countries , officials are obliged by law to disclose any presents they receive . such presents are considered public property and government officials have no right to dispose of them privately .
royal order no . 16 dated 17 / 3 / 1382 ah had been previously issued in the kingdom , stipulating that officials should be questioned and called to account on the sources of their assets and the assets of their children ; this was known as the " how did you earn it " system . the system showed the government 's interest at the time for integrity among governmental authorities .
however , this system did not receive any attention and drowned in the wave of prosperity , which came in the absence of discipline , and thus corruption crept in .
i return to what i said previously : the situation is not yet at a stage where it is beyond remedy .
remedy is still possible , with clean intentions , and righteous endeavors . it is achievable by taking reformative , preventive and corrective measures , including : 1 - revision of all outdated regulations , and updating them so that they adapt to new administration methods . this will shorten the work process , and the procedures for accessing public services , through clarifying and announcing them in government service centers .
2 - improving the standard of living socially and economically for some of the disadvantaged classes in society .
3 - strengthening the sense of religious restraint with special attention to the media .
spreading awareness of the damages caused by corruption , through religious addresses at mosques , scholars , writers and teachers .
4 - adhering to an approach of transparency and disclosure ,
announcing financial , economic and statistic figures , as well as information relating to government contracts .
5 - supporting and strengthening the management and funding of financial and administrative auditing systems , so that they can play a more effective roll in auditing public funds ,
monitoring performance , and exposing offences , transgressions and corruption .
6 - giving the media and civil society institutions a responsible role in monitoring and exposing corrupt procedures .
7 - putting together and approving a system for protecting public property . the system should incorporate fundamentals of custody and limits of liability for custodians of public funds ; it should also include the creation of a universal authority for protecting and maintaining public funds similar to what is practiced in many other countries .
8 - giving the consultative council more authority to monitor , control and supervise the performance of government bodies ,
including access to general budget information , approving it , summoning officials and questioning offenders .
9 - rotating sensitive posts that are closely linked to public funds by choosing those who occupy them carefully and limiting their period in office .
and allah shall guide our intentions .

hotel rates in mecca increase 200 % in the last ten days of ramadan .
eilaf - mecca mukaramah
hotel rates in the central area of the haram al-shareef increased 200 % in the last ten days of ramadan and their occupancy is up to 100 % , due to the large numbers of locals and foreigners performing umrah and other visitors who are committed to spending the last days of ramadan in the embrace of the ancient holy mosque .

many hotels in the central areas are fully booked and declined new reservations .
at 3 - star hotels room rates reached 500 riyals during the last 10 days of ramadan , while suites went for 1000 riyals per day .
salem al-matrifi , a hotel owner in the central province , told saudi newspaper al-madina , that the last 10 days of ramadan are the only real season for hotels and residential units ,
with occupancy rates at 100 % . he indicated that 3 - star hotels and residential units make the visitor program during ramadan 's last ten cost between 5000 and 6000 riyals .

standards for employing saudi women in commercial activities prevent mixing and allow privacy .
standards for employing saudi women in commercial activities prevent mixing and allow privacy .
riyadh : ahmad al-mansoor al-zamel deputy for the ministry of labor , labor affairs , said to the riyadh newspaper on saturday 14 / 10 / 2005 , that the ministry of labor 's standards for commercial activities are universal ; the most important of which are giving women privacy and preventing them from mixing with men .
the ministry does not issue any specific regulations , it only gives certification to shops after inspecting them and proving that they do not allow mixing between men and women or any other offences contradicting islamic law . this means that a shop run by female staff should forbid the entry of men .
al-zamel denied that the ministry had allowed women to work alongside men in jewelry and gold shops situated in shopping complexes . he reiterated that this commercial activity serves ladies ' requirements and does not have any different standards of operation when it comes to barring mixing with men .
al-zamel explained that there are women 's sections available in some commercial markets . they are established and licensed to work according to specific standards and regulations . work has already started to implement the decision to employ women in ladies ' clothing and supply outlets , and the license thereof is granted to applicants meeting the requirements .
more than a year ago , the cabinet issued a decision requiring government offices that provide services to women to establish women - only units and sections as needed .
it also required the council of chambers to form a women 's committee to work in coordination with the relevant authorities to identify activities and fields of work for saudi women that do not require opening another loophole for the recruitment of foreign women workers .
the committee will work to qualify and train saudi women for these activities with the contribution of government bodies .
the cabinet 's decision stipulated that the human resources development fund should include the training and employment of saudi women in its plans and programs and that employment in shops selling women 's necessities should be restricted to saudi women .
the ministry of labor was required to set a schedule for implementing the decision and monitoring the progress of it within one year of its issue .
accordingly , the ministry of labor started identifying the types of shops covered in this decision . the implementation to proceed works in two stages : firstly , shop owners would be given a notice period to adapt to the decision , at the same time saudi women would be prepared and trained to work in these shops .
the second stage would be in field of supervision and banning men from work selling women 's supplies and requisites . more than a year has now passed since the cabinet 's decision without men being prevented from selling in these shops .
a number of businessmen who work in these retail activities gave some recommendations , during their meetings with the trade chambers , to simplify the implementation of the decision . among these recommendations are : preparing training plans for the changeover stage , setting working standards and regulations to protect both the employer and the employee and to preserve their rights in cases of negligence and insubordination , in addition to setting standards for dealing with women ,
implementing the idea in large commercial complexes in the main cities , where experienced non - saudi ladies are allowed to perform training and supervision tasks in the first stages of the changeover , determining the salary structures and incentives for female saudi staff , and applying them in all work centers ,
giving women the opportunity to work in the fields of security and cleaning in commercial complexes .
the final objective being the use of the workforce and preparing the workplace .
according to businessmen working in this sector , there are problems and obstacles facing this implementation , among them the lack of a trained workforce who can perform the tasks of selling , administration , and accounting , the lack of women personnel in this field , long working hours , and the need for two daily shifts ,
in addition to the fact that working hours end late at night especially during weekends and public holidays , the lack of clear bylaws and working rules , the large number of holidays for women staff and the aversion of some women to women - only markets in general .
moreover , complete implementation will result in a number of problems and negative side effects .

jeddah
a courteous spirit prevailed among the candidates who were not fortunate enough to win the jeddah chamber elections . women candidates considered the elections a victory for saudi women since they succeeded in the elections at their first attempt .
we might consider that women did not achieve any representation in the first trial of electoral stages in arab countries , whereas they were given a deserved vote of confidence in their first initiative in the chamber 's history ; the vote of confidence is therefore for all women and the trust must be well - placed .
initially , businesswoman batul jamjoum praised the extensive efforts of the " jeddah " group in general , considering their victory a victory for all . she expects strong cooperation between male and female members in the future .
jamjoum elucidated that she expected the participation of elements from other coalitions in order to vary the themes and aims .
she indicated that winning two seats in the election is a very strong experience for women , if we consider the short preparation period preceding this nascent experiment in the history of the kingdom .
businesswoman hanan al-madani expressed the same opinion , when she voiced her pleasure and pride in winning two seats for saudi women . she also predicted the triumph of the jeddah group over other strong contenders because of their outstanding efforts .
responding to a question from okaz on possible future discrimination or differentiation between female members , al-madani answered , confirming that from the outset of this experiment members have agreed to cooperate and compete . she added saying that the victory of lama al-suleiman and nashwa taher will increase this cooperation and strengthen the bond , which in turn will serve the homeland .
on her hopes for what the two winning candidates will provide she said , " we trust them immensely . we expect them to perform an effective and outstanding role in the executive board , making every effort to serve businesswomen and support home projects . we will stand behind them in this effort " .
businesswoman buthaina mumina considered the two chamber seats won by women to be a victory for every businesswoman . she confirmed that this victory will strengthen the already existing support and cooperation bonds between candidates which did not falter in the face of fair competition .

first five saudi women to be employed by a hotel in the eastern region
dammam
saudi newspaper al-yaum reported today that the first five saudi women are preparing to start work at one of the biggest hotels in the eastern region where they have been accepted for a number of hotel jobs , among them a women 's party coordinator and a receptionist , after special separate areas were secured and equipped to provide them with privacy at work .
it is notable that this experiment is the first of its kind in the eastern region , preceded by a hotel in the riyadh region appointing saudi women in the marketing and sales departments .
a hotel in the greater jeddah province also hired saudi women specialized in party planning .
the idea of employing women in several limited lines of work in hotels came about as a result of the pressing need to provide some services specifically for female clients .
this step comes as part of a campaign by the saudi ministry of labor to employ saudi women which was announced a few months ago in given areas of the saudi labor market , especially after a human resources fund was set up to support all trade enterprises , including hotels .

jeddah businesswomen : between supporting and opposing election blocs

jeddah businesswomen : between supporting and opposing election blocs
fahad al-baqmi from jeddah
29 / 10 / 2005
intense disputes are rife between businesswomen standing as candidates for membership of the administrative board of the chamber of commerce and industry . some have joined male election blocs and other candidates have rejected the idea of joining election blocs and prefer to stand as independent candidates .
according to independent candidate ibtisam subhi al-jaridi , there are attempts by businesswomen standing as candidates in the elections to abstain from voting because these practices affect the election process in their view , especially as the female experiment is a new one and still in its early stages .
al-jaridi added that a number of female candidates had held several meetings aimed at persuading businesswomen who joined blocs to stand as independent candidates . she said these candidates refused to back down from joining blocs on the pretext that male election blocs guarantee them membership because of the electoral experience of businessmen involved in previous rounds .
according to election observers , the participation of women for the first time in the chamber council elections has led to something of a change in the orientation of the participating groups .
while election groupings have attracted women to the grouping , a number of women have come to the fore who wish to enter the elections as independents , a step that is regarded as a challenge to businessmen through the formation of a strong female bloc .
in spite of this , some women have refused to join any blocs whatever their form in a step aimed at fighting the election process as independents .
candidate abdulkhaliq saeed , member of the mustaqbal group participating in the election , had previously said that the group was negotiating with a number of businesswomen to get them to join the group with the aim of providing businesswomen with services in the event of the group winning the elections . he said businesswomen understand each others ' needs better than men .
the jeddah group , led by engineer mohamed abdullatif jamil , includes two businesswomen , nashwa abdulhadi taher and luma abdulaziz al-suleiman . other groups with other candidates do not want businesswomen in their blocs while the female competition is led by the alawail group .
a number of observers expect the elections will see sharp competition between election groups in the next stage in order to attract candidates among businesswomen , especially as each group includes influential members among their candidates .
the election race is expected to take off in the period november 12 through 27 at the chamber 's main office .
it should be mentioned that the chamber of commerce in jeddah is about 60 years old and dates back from the end of world war ii . it was set up as a result of a royal decree by king abdulaziz al saud which gave it the right of distinction over other saudi chambers as it was the only one created by royal decree .
over the past six decades , the jeddah chamber has had eight presidents , many of whom went on to become ministers in the saudi government . the post of treasurer has been held by 14 treasurers and its board used to be selected by election with the exception of the period headed by sheikh ismail abu dawud which lasted the 32 years he was nominated for .
the number of male and female members of the chamber is over 22,000 .

modest female turnout at the jeddah chamber elections

modest female turnout at the jeddah chamber elections
jeddah
elections at the jeddah chamber continued for the second day with a modest turnout by businesswomen . six female candidates were absent and preferred to stay in their offices in order to talk to male and female voters . saudi newspaper al-watan reported that the number of voters during the morning period yesterday , sunday , was only 11 , which angered some female candidates while others felt unconcerned .
businesswoman salwa radhwan said she had expected the non - attendance by voters as the number of active trade registers at the chamber of trade that she dealt with personally was 400 , with very few women among them , the remainder being representatives or husbands or suchlike .
she added , " if we want to compare the two sexes , we find that , in the chamber 's elections last year , out of 25,000 businessmen , there were only 14,000 voters . "
radhwan attributed the absence of businesswomen to them looking for opportunities to talk to voters and that staying in their offices would promote the election process more than their presence at the voting center at the chamber .
in spite of the negative aspects reported by the media concerning the number of absentees , she and a large group of businesswomen are very optimistic about winning .
candidate khadija bukhari said she stayed away on the second day because of the lack of seriousness of the visitors she noted on the first day .
she said , " when we ask them to vote , they look at us arrogantly and say " we 'll see , god willing " ; really , the process isn 't about begging . we haven 't spent all these years in the commercial field to get to this point so i stayed in my office all day so that i could talk to all my contacts , both male and female , and managed to get votes , compared to nothing on the first day . "
she added , " i can 't find any explanation for what 's happening and why so where are the women and where are the voters and what happened to women giving their votes to women ? no - one can answer us and i find this a frustration of our hopes and a collapse of our ambitions so how can we face men and say here we come ? "
businesswoman luma al-suleiman was not surprised by the absence of voters and said the number of female voters for the morning and evening period yesterday was 45 but this could rise to 50 over the next few hours . the total for the two days is expected to be 100 by the end of the second day , the majority of whom are men because there are no or very few businesswomen with registers in their personal names , and in terms of proportionality , the outcome is inevitable and all will be revealed tomorrow evening , tuesday .
she attributed the low numbers to the fact that the pre - election period was very short , especially as the month of ramadan and eid are considered to be slow periods for many activities . she said , " our presentation of ourselves and other businesswomen was not as it should have been . even we as candidates were unfamiliar with the election culture at the time so how can others know . we had to learn a lot in a very short period of time so the results we see today are expected . "
businesswomen nawal bitar and samira shik complained about the lack of female voters and attributed this to a lack of awareness of this new experiment for which the relevant authorities should have provided guidance and preparation in the course of the various stages of this experiment but said they had not yet lost hope that male votes would make up for the rarity of female votes .
businesswoman hanan madani said she was fed up with waiting but at the same time said there was hope that the coming hours would bring unexpected surprises even though what she has seen over the two days does not bode well . she said there was still time and it would be hard to know now . she said , " what we are optimistic about is male voters because i don 't think we are depending on what we see in the women 's hall where there is only boredom . "
women vote against themselves in the jeddah chamber elections

women vote against themselves in the jeddah chamber elections
all the beauty products and powders used by businesswomen in their election programs failed spectacularly to draw society ladies to vote at the ballot boxes .
disappointment was the most obvious trait on the faces of female candidates hoping to get a seat in the jeddah chamber of commerce following a low turnout of under a 100 voters out of the total females registered at the chamber of commerce and trade ; their number reach nearly 2000 female trade registers according to figures over the past three days .
the face of this first experience for businesswomen has exposed several bumpy patches in understanding the mechanics of candidacy for the jeddah chamber of commerce as a result of a lack of preliminary preparations for female participation and not giving them enough opportunity to prepare to compete with men for the chamber seats being competed for of which there are 12 .
candidate hussa al-aun defended the participation of women in the first female election seen in the country by saying , " it is a step that has come after much demand and effort and it must be supported in spite of all the negative aspects that arose during the implementation phase . "
she went on to say that businesswomen in jeddah had carried out a statistical study prior to the beginning of elections and found that current trade registers or those not run by saudi men or foreign sleeping partners do not exceed 400 trade registers .
for her part , candidate madhawi al-hassoun thought it unlikely that the number of active trade registers was only 400 , basing this on her contacts in recent days with businesswomen wanting to take part in the voting process but whose requests were rejected as they had not renewed their membership in the three months prior to the beginning of the elections .
for her part , al-aun agreed that not abiding by the renewal condition led to around 50 businesswomen not being able to vote and was one reason for the lack of participation . however , she insisted that proportionality meant that female participation was reasonable given the circumstances the election was faced with , at the top of which was a lack of social awareness and not making an exception for women with regard to the renewal condition , even though approval for female participation came about two months before the elections actually began .
the female election result was not consistent with the voting threshold in spite of the use of a battery of media weapons in the candidates ' manifestos who showed great flexibility in cooperating with the media , their photographs appearing despite them being known for many decades in trade circles , a necessity in the election game .
however , al-hassoun , in commenting on the most significant positive aspects of the election process last saturday and sunday , said that " simply accepting the idea that women can go and vote and breaking the deadlock women were in is a positive indicator for the next elections , especially in the midst of the big media hubbub that accompanied the female vote on the one hand and the opposition of other sides on the other hand . "
businesswomen who did not take part in the elections said that media exaggeration in news coverage is what gave people the impression that there would be huge participation by jeddah businesswomen yet with no consideration being given to the organizational and social obstacles preventing participation in the elections .
on the other hand , al-aun asserted that the absence of a democratic vision by a large section of women should not conceal the ability to see the great capacity demonstrated by saudi businesswomen in their attempts to understand the election game and to carry saudi women through the rules and regulations to the place they deserve , adding that " 100 voting is a step on the 1,000 - mile road . "
real estate in saudi these days . . . and when will it pick up ?

real estate in saudi these days . . . and when will it pick up ?
saudi real estate markets are expected to see activity in the coming period because of capital being taken out of the financial market as a result of concerns about rumors of expected upheavals in the market and as a precautionary measure to preserve capital since property investment is seen as less risky than the financial market .
it should be mentioned that the saudi real estate market has seen a sort of stagnation as a result of the absence of deterrent measures , particularly since a number of fraud operations were stopped and those responsible held accountable .
a revival is expected more and more in this sector as international capital pours into the region as a result of agreements signed on the fringes of the kingdom of saudi arabia 's accession to the world trade organization , in addition to the saudi policy aimed at providing every saudi citizen with a house . some observers see saudi demand as being around 4 million new houses over the next 15 years .
one of the first initiatives is by the british construction company bovis lindleys working alongside architects foster &amp; partners with an investment of 13 billion dollars in saudi to build houses for citizens .
this same company is also working with its saudi counterpart to develop a massive site outside the capital riyadh .
at present , the saudi real estate market is in a state of relative stagnation as the month of ramadan approaches .
it is expected to pick up next month , especially as new real estate regulations and laws will come into effect after the eid holiday . .
however , a number of small deals are being put into practice while others are being prepared in the background , ready to be launched once the new regulations come into effect .
many real estate experts in saudi agree that the coming period will see a big move by investors towards villas , housing units and duplexes and expect that the process will be achieved using methods and means ensuring that new markets open up focusing their activity on housing units and housing complexes .
in this context , the deputy president of the real estate board at the riyadh chamber of commerce and industry , engineer mohammed saleh bin al-khalil , said that what is noticeable is the diverse real estate activity at the start of the month of ramadan even though it is a holy month where there is usually less real estate activity . he mentioned a number of promising deals that are encouraging , even though they are small , and said that the presence of families gathered together has helped increase the sale of villas , apartments and small land plots all over riyadh , with a lot of demand in the north and east .

he added , during a celebration he held recently for members of the chamber 's administrative board which was attended by a number of media people from the area , that a committee would be set up to deal with matters related to dates and would include a group of members of the chamber 's administrative board , date traders , farmers and lecturers from the agricultural and food sciences college at king faisal university .
he said the aim of setting up a committee was to manage date palms , to improve the quality of dates produced and to find new markets to distribute the surplus from date plantations in the region .
he said that the committee for the saudization of private sector jobs , which was established during the previous session , would continue its work and stated that the current session of the new committee would focus on training and preparing saudi youth for the job market and try and find employment opportunities for them in private sector companies and establishments by liaising with the relevant parties , such as the ministry of labor and private sector establishments .

saudi woman refuses to nominate her group to win seats in the jeddah chamber
a female saudi candidate to win a seat on the chamber of commerce and industry yesterday refused to nominate any colleagues in her group for a seat in the chamber , justifying this refusal with " businesswomen in other groups needing her vote " .
madhawi al-hassun , a member of the future group , told " al-sharq al-awsat " that she would not nominate any businessmen in any group whatsoever . a number of members of her group commented that they respected her view ,
but that they would still nominate her .
however , they would not nominate any other businesswoman .
she explained that women at the jeddah chamber had secured a place at the khadija bint khuwailad center
and are currently looking for a structure , in her view , by obtaining the largest number of seats possible in the chamber
and succeeding alongside men in accordance with islamic laws and noble social values .
at a time when voters doubt the credibility of promises made by candidates for the jeddah chamber of commerce and industry , a member of the future group nominated for a seat on the chamber 's board said that his group had a clear strategy for achieving what it promises .
mazin yusuf saleh , spokesman for the future group , told " al-sharq al-awsat " that his group had set out nine objectives , some of which would be achieved within two years while others would take four years to complete , as he put it .
yusuf saleh , said to be an articulate speaker and a poet who only shows his feelings to a few close friends , went on to say
that every one of the group 's stated objectives was subject to a strategic plan to achieve it .
he stressed that his group did not only make promises but would also keep its promises in the event of winning seats in the chamber .
with regard to his predictions abut who would win from his group and other groups , he said " i expect us to win all the seats on the chamber 's board . "
fellow group member madhawi al-hassun disagreed with him and predicted that no less than three women would win seats along with several businessmen from other groups .
for his part , doctor mohammed al-mutlaq , head of the future group , considered the higher number of candidates this year to be a healthy phenomenon and described it as a good thing .
he said the elections this year differed from previous years since they include the largest number of candidates in the chamber 's history since its launch , in addition to being in keeping with international trends giving women the opportunity to exercise their rights in all areas and opening up the possibility of nomination and election to them .
as the countdown for the nomination and voting date began , groups were busy preparing their manifestoes , scheduling dates and liaising with members of their groups ,
as well as giving attention to press meetings , the mirror that reflects their strategies to the jeddah business community in the hope of gaining their approval and their votes .
the 73 candidates were divided among blocs of groups while some chose to remain independent . they all agreed on the importance of making appearances and presentations during meetings with the media in its written , heard and visual forms .
the candidates stressed that one member winning did not mean the group as a whole had lost ; to the contrary , it ensures the group 's message is heard and its strategy set in motion .
it was noted that group members visited the offices of the employment department in jeddah province as part of a program of visits by members of the group to active organizations in the province and attached provinces .

the satirical french weekly , le canard enchaine , has reported that iranian manucher ghorbanifar , who worked as an agent for the israeli intelligence service mossad and the american central intelligence agency , the cia , provided the territorial surveillance department ( dst - the counter - intelligence agency ) with the memorandum that has stirred up controversy in france and provoked an investigation into the french government making a ransom payment in 1988 to secure the release of french hostages held in lebanon and the embezzlement by officials of part of that sum .
ghorbanifar , it added , is resident in france and submitted the memorandum to take his revenge against the 1988 french government , which had not sufficiently rewarded him for his quick efforts to help free the hostages .
it added that he worked as an arms dealer and had become an " indispensable " intermediary between the islamic regime in iran and a number of western states .
on 21 december serious charges of concealing funds and abuse of influence were brought against marie - daniele faure , assistant to the former french minister of the interior charles pasqua , and christiane , wife of mep jean - charles marchiani , on suspicion of conspiring to take possession of part of the supposed ransom .
representatives of the sudanese government and the sudanese people 's liberation army have begun talks in switzerland for a ceasefire in the nuba mountains , central sudan , in a significant step in the peace process , which aims to put an end to the 18 - year civil war in which more than two million have died .
the talks , which have been made possible by american and swiss efforts , will continue for one week . the sudanese government delegation comprises ten people and that of the people 's army a similar number .
the venue was kept secret at the request of both parties .
the spokesman for the swiss ministry of foreign affairs daniella schtofeil said , " it is not in berne , nor geneva . "
she added , " everything relating to the ceasefire mechanism will be discussed : how to implement it , the areas it will cover , its duration and implementation guarantees . "
sudanese people liberation army spokesman , samson kwaje , said before the talks that neither of the delegation was represented by prominent figures .
he added , " they are technical committees which will only discuss a ceasefire in the nuba mountains ... they are not peace talks . "
deputy minister of the sudanese ministry of foreign affairs mutraf sidiq , who heads the government delegation , confirmed that he possessed " full authorization to do anything to make the talks succeed " .
in khartoum , the special american representative to sudan , john danforth , held talks with the peace affairs adviser to the sudanese president ghazi salah al-din al-atabani , in the context of his efforts to make progress on the four points he proposed last november to assess the extent of the determination of the government and the rebels to bring about peace .
these steps include an end to bombing of civilian targets , a ceasefire in the nuba mountains area , identification of safe areas to facilitate and distribute aid and efforts to prevent rebels from trading in civilians .
al-atabani said that progress had been made on three of the points but that further discussion was required on some issues - a reference to the matter outstanding : avoiding bombing civilians in light of the recent breach of a commitment to maintain calm .
he added , " we made clear to the american side that the movement was responsible for the breach and that the government 's position was sound . "
" i myself went to the nuba mountains to look into the situation there and i found that the movement had tried to exploit the period of calm prior to the talks to make progress on the ground . the government will deal decisively with any new attempts by the rebel movement to make military gains by exploiting the present talks . "
nevertheless , he noted that the simple fact of the talks in switzerland getting underway represented " evidence of progress " .
danforth promised to include the comments of the sudanese government in his report , which he will submit to the american administration following his visit to sudan , which began last saturday .
today he is to travel to al-abyad in northern kardafan , kadoqli in south kardafan and rombiq , in the state of al-buhairat , which is under rebel combat , and will return to khartoum tomorrow .

two days after american assistant secretary of state for near eastern affairs william burns announced that no decision had been taken on iraq by america , german foreign minister joschka fischer said that berlin would maintain " extreme caution " regarding the expansion of the american campaign against terrorism beyond afghanistan because this would raise " serious questions " were it to include iraq without there being evidence for iraq 's involvement in the 11 september attacks . turkish prime minister bolant ajaweed is visiting washington to discuss this and other issues .
fischer said , " unless there is irrefutable evidence , the issue ( striking iraq ) will be very difficult " and it will raise " serious questions about the result " .
fischer 's words reiterate the stance adopted by german chancellor gerhard schroeder , who is to meet american president george bush in washington towards the end of this month .
before leaving ankara , ajaweed was asked about his expectations regarding the efforts of the american administration to overthrow iraqi president , saddam hussein , but replied that he wised to make no comment on hypotheses .
he responded to the reports about the spread of the independence tendency in northern iraq , saying , " we monitor all developments in the north of iraq closely and take the measures necessary when the need arises . "
former turkish foreign minister momtaz soysal said , " american policy aims to free iraq from saddam 's rule , which will require military intervention unless turkey does its utmost to persuade saddam to respond to un resolutions (...) this would be preferable to any military action , which no one , neither the government , nor public opinion , nor the opposition , wants . "
the babel newspaper , which is overseen by udai saddam hussein , reported that " officials in turkey that the interest of the turkish people was with and would remain with iraq " .
it added , " what makes our people ask more than one question is the justification which drive turkish official to act towards a country which has tried , and continues to try , to save the neighboring turkish people from the effects of the economic earthquake " , and that the american administration " can provide them with reviving dose but this failing administration cannot solve turkey 's problems " because it wants turkey to be " weak and shaken " .
meanwhile , the executive director of the oil for food program and deputy un secretary - general benon sevan has began a three - week visit to iraq - his first since august 2000 .

saudi nationals returning home from the united states have complained of the violent methods adopted by officials in the american security services during their investigation into those involved in the 11 september attacks .
some believe that the accounts of these people could create tension in relations between washington , where authorities have detained hundreds of saudis for investigation , and riyadh , which confirms that there is no evidence pointing to the involvement of its nationals , despite the belief that 15 of the 19 suicide attacks who carried out the attacks were from the kingdom of saudi arabia .
muhammad , a student from a prominent family who asked to remain anonymous , reported that his fiancee and other relatives of his were violated when american officials mistakenly thought that he was mohammad ata , who is suspected of leading the hijackers of the aircraft which flew into the twin towers of the world trade center and the american ministry of defense , the pentagon .
he said that his fiancee , who was at a hotel in boston on 12 september , " opened the door to take a newspaper and found a man in civilian clothes pointing a gun to her head , who quickly grabbed her and hit her in the face with handcuffs . "
he clarified that american officers had demanded an immediate confession .
he added that his brother 's wife and her brother were forced to kneel and restrained .
he concluded , " i do not want to provoke the anger of the united states ... but i do want to explain what happened . "
whilst the american ministry of justice refused to comment on the matter , the family 's representative in boston , attorney jonathon shapiro said that the treatment received by his clients was " one of the worst violations of civil rights by the government .. . the authorities abused them in a terrible way . "
khalid al-qahtani complained , " the way my brother zuhair and his wife were arrested was barbaric . " they were restrained and the veil was removed from the latter 's head .
he said , " we must make a case and engage a lawyer . "
saudi lawyer katib al-shamri said that some saudis had asked him to initiate proceedings against the american authorities for compensation for material and moral damages suffered by them .

it quoted sources in the russian defense ministry , who said that the talks would continue for two days and would deal with strategic stability following the american decision on the 13th of last december to abandon the anti - ballistic missile ( abm ) treaty .
head of the russian delegation , first deputy to the russian forces general staff general yuri balovski , said that the issue of reducing strategic nuclear weapons would be discussed at various levels between now and next summer .

the court secretariat reported that the court had adjourned after a few minutes and will resume on friday due to the absence of one of the accused , who are under house arrest .
the incident took place on the 1st of last march , and it was announced that soldiers were killed in a chechen rebel ambush . however , the investigation conducted by the public prosecutor 's office discovered that a convoy of special forces from the ministry of the interior came under fire from forces from the same ministry who were heading to the location to replace forces .
this resulted in 22 dead and more than 30 wounded .
it was the worst loss life of russian forces in a single incident since the beginning of the chechen conflict .

the saudi al-watan newspaper yesterday published a manuscript confirming that the ajyad fortress , the removal of which provoked the anger of the turkish government , was built by inhabitants of the area using the funds they provided . the kingdom of saudi arabia has meanwhile opened the door for submission of proposals to execute a housing project on the site of the fortress as part of the framework for modernizing mecca to meet the increasing numbers of pilgrims .
this document is included in a book entitled " the history of the nobles who ruled the two holy places " , which was written by abdullah muhammad abd al-shakur , a hijaz scholar , in the nineteenth century .
the book states that the fortress was built during the reign of the sharif of mecca , surur bin musaid , between the years 1772 and 1788 " by the efforts and funding of the sharif and local , not turkish , workers " .
the manuscript clarified that surur bin musaid " gathered together the laborers and foremen in the country and commenced work on the fortress on top of mt . balbal at the foot of ajyad (...) after buying all the surrounding homes for the wood and stone " .
it added that he " drew together all those able to work on the fortress , with those unable sending their companions , and the amount of money spent daily on the fortress was two thousand piastres , which represented the daily wage of the workers " and that " many of the workers did not take their wages because most of the work was voluntary " .
the newspaper took this to mean that " neither the ottoman state nor turkey had any connection of any kind to the ajyad fortress , other that it came under ottoman rule , as was the case with the other arab areas and countries " .
it confirmed that the ajyad fortress " was a purely local monument , built on saudi territory by the hands of the inhabitants of the arabian peninsula , not those of the turks , " and for that reason , " the turkish interference in the matter of the ajyad fortress has no legal or historical basis " .
yesterday the saudi ambassador to turkey , muhammad al-bassam , said , " every step taken by the saudi government is for the benefit , safety and comfort of the pilgrims " .
the government of the kingdom has requested that proposals be submitted to execute a housing complex project on the site of the fortress . the weekly economic publication middle east economic digest ( meed ) yesterday reported that the project , which had been proposed by the ministry of islamic affairs , had a value of 530 million dollars and would include 11 housing blocks , a twin - tower five star hotel with a capacity of 1200 rooms , a commercial center and garage , and a model of the fortress .
it is expected to be finished in 2005 .
the commercial and housing complex is one of the projects underway to modernize mecca . the faqih research and development center confirmed that " most of the buildings [ which ] are currently situated near the sanctuary cannot meet the increasing numbers of pilgrims " and that " the only solution is to develop the area surrounding the mosque by building towers in order to increase capacity and solve traffic problems " .
the mecca development plan provides for a threefold increase to the present housing area to cover five square kilometers capable of receiving 1.2 million visitors , compared with just 500 thousand at present .
car parks will be capable of absorbing 45 thousand cars and pedestrian areas will increase from 6 to 120 thousand square meters .
at present , markets are spread over 180 thousand square meters around the mosque , whilst the plan provides for the creation of commercial centres covering 660 thousand square meters .
to facilitate traffic flow and prevent jams , 40 side roads will be built leading to the mosque , in addition to pedestrian tunnels .
a project similar to the accommodation buildings and shopping centre is to be built on the site of an old hospital near the mosque , which bears the same name as the ajyad fortress , and a new hospital will be built inside the complex .
three constructions companies , mecca construction , the bin ladin group and awjih al-saudiyyah , have come together in a single consortium for this project .

general parvez musharraf came to power as a result of a military coup in protest at former prime minister nawaz sharif 's acceptance of the withdrawal of kashmiri fighters who had penetrated indian lines in kashmir between may and july 1999 .
the political basis of the coup was to put an end to nawaz al-sharif 's concessions in the face of american and indian pressures at the time .
nawaz sharif was viewed at the time as having abandoned pakistan 's central national historical cause , kashmir .
yesterday , general parvez himself , now prime minister and responsible for pakistan 's general policy , went to the people to offer the greatest concession to india : to commit himself to dismantling the military infrastructure of the kashmiri resistance movements and prevent " cross - border operations " .
were nawaz sharif able to appear in public today , he would have said to his successor , " now you understand the meaning of international pressures when they increase and intensify , and the price for standing up to them becomes so high that you just can 't pay . "
the rest of the story is not hard to guess : widespread arrests in the ranks of kashmiri and islamist activists and the targeting of islamic schools along a path that leads , for the first time since pakistan was founded , to an examination of the curriculum of those schools in the name of unifying the government educational system . it is the logic of the state and its supreme interests that leads us to the point where it is no longer possible for it to coexist with statelets and private armies , no matter how great their popular , historical , political or moral legitimacy .
ultimately , only the state can become subject to international accountability in isolation from every national or religious duty arising from an issue that successive generations have learnt to venerate . ..
the musharraf of 1999 is the same as that of 2002 .
but the world is no longer the same .
that is what is important .

and now lebanon : it is no secret that one of the most prominent achievements of president emil lahud 's recent political life , which , it is said , paved the way for his selection as president of the republic by deceased president hafiz al-asad , occurred in 1993 when he seized on the syrian atmospherics with noticeable speed to reject implementation of the decision taken by the lebanese political authority at the time , which had decided to deploy the lebanese army in the south in the wake of the israeli operation " settlement of account " .
the lahud political and propaganda machine continues to present this event as evidence of the general 's sound reading of the correct national posture . it has been employed elsewhere to settle political accounts with the former president of the republic ilyas al-harawi and prime minister rafiq al-hariri .
one of lahud 's boasts as president is that he , by virtue of his political steadfastness during negotiations with the united nations following liberation on 25 may 2000 , secured the return of 17 million square meters of lebanese territory and retained the right to an armed resistance that is inseparable from hizbollah .
his stance as guarantor of a unified national position , alongside and with the continuation of armed resistance to date , albeit without any certain or verifiable consensus , provides another example .
but there is a long time between the summer of 1993 and may 2000 .
and there is a long time between may 2000 and september 2001 : lebanon 's legal status has changed .
shabaa is undefined in the lexicon of resolution 425 .
at the gate to baabda , larsen 's presence was clear , to the extent of being uncouth .
he did not pay lahud any compliments . nor did he exchange formal courtesies in a way that would satisfy the lebanese president .
america is closer to israel and is on the point of accusing us all of terrorism .
it is not hizbollah alone , but the state that supports and offers it sanctuary , that opens the door to military operations on the borders with israel .
what israeli has failed to do in half a century is exactly what india has failed to do in the case of kashmir .
following 11 september israel has wholly won over the american position , largely gained the european stance and much of that of the united nations .
following 11 september india , after half a century , has gained international support for labeling the kashmiri resistance " cross - border terrorism " .
and ultimately , musharraf could do nothing but weigh up the balance of probabilities of a heavy defeat to be added to the loss in afghanistan .
and so he elected to save the state , the unity of the country and its place in the international balance .
he did not act recklessly , even though he has nuclear warheads .
despite the fact that he knows that he may pay with his life for this spurt of rationality , rationality which pakistan has lacked for a long time .

lebanon : the day on which it will confront decisive choices is not far away .
either the state , the logic of the state , the unity of the country and its place in the international community , or a continuation of double standards and pretending to be clever towards an international situation which has clearly tired of the " clever " lebanese who now exaggerate their own significance .
* * *
the lahud of 1993 and 2000 is the same as that of 2002 .
but here too the world is not the same .
and that is crucial .

contacts are taking place away from the spotlights with the aim of sounding out views on the possibility of progressing negotiations on the lebanese and syrian tracts should talks continue to stumble on the palestinian front as a result of the continued exchange of violence and the failure to reach agreement on a durable ceasefire .
these contacts , which are being undertaken by american and european parties , aim to find out the extent to which syria and lebanon are prepared to enter into talks with israel on the basis of implementation of resolutions 425 , 242 and 338 , whereby israeli forces would withdraw from the golan and the shabaa farms , prisoners and detainees would be exchanged between the three parties and peace would be realized between israel on the one hand and syria and lebanon on the other . efforts to establish peace between israel and the palestinian authority would continue .
the question being asked is this : would reaching an agreement in negotiations conducted on the syrian and lebanese tract in isolation from talks undertaken on the palestinian front complicate the process of arriving at a comprehensive peace ? or would it simplify it , given that negotiations have succeeded in bringing about individual solutions , as was the case with camp david , which resulted in an agreement between egypt and israel , the israeli - palestinian talks which produced oslo and the israeli - jordanian talks which led to the wadi araba agreement . at the same time negotiations have sometimes stumbled on the syrian and lebanese tracts and sometimes stopped altogether , on account of israel failing to implement the agreements made between it and the palestinians authority , thereby failing to reach a peace agreement between them which would allow a move to negotiations on the syrian and palestinian fronts and bring about a comprehensive peace in the region ?
there are some who say that getting an agreement between israel on the one hand , and syria and lebanon on the other , may be easier that waiting for a complex agreement between israel and the palestinian authority , in order to prevent the syrian and lebanese tracts from freezing up given that talks on the palestinian tract have sometimes stumbled and sometimes stopped altogether .
at the same time , an agreement between israel on the one hand , and syria and lebanon on the other , might give impetus to and speed up the agreement between israel and palestinian authority to prevent the authority from being the only party outside the peace process .
in addition , an agreement between israel on the one hand and syria and lebanon on the other would negate the reasons for continuing the lebanese resistance because both the shabaa farms and the golan would have been liberated . the continuation of resistance in order to liberate palestine , which has people of its own to assume this responsibility , would be unacceptable .
and then there are those who say that there can be no comprehensive peace in the region unless it is achieved on the palestinian , syrian and lebanese tracts and that fragmenting solutions may achieve temporary security or truce on the lebanese and syrian borders with israel , but it cannot achieve a comprehensive peace and permanent and lasting security .
and perhaps it is the palestinian question that lies at the heart of the middle east crisis : any solution agreed with israel that fails to resolve this question would ensure that the situation in the region remains critical and disturbed , and keep a comprehensive peace at some considerable distance .
resolving the palestinian question is thus the key to resolving the other issues that make up the middle east crisis , but solving all the other issues is not the key to resolving the palestinian question , the solution of which would pave the way for a comprehensive peace .
and it could be difficult for arab borders with israel to remain calm were there to be a war between israelis and palestinians .
in addition , the problem of palestinian refugees , should it continue without solution , would make it difficult for lebanon and syria to sign a peace agreement with israel . it is not sufficient for israeli forces to withdraw from the shabaa farms and the golan or for there to be an exchange of prisoners and detainees to achieve peace unless the refugee problem , which represents a time bomb for lebanon more so than other host arab nations , is also solved because their presence in lebanon has a political aspect : they are permitted to bear arms to defend their cause and their right to return to their homes .
but those engaged in contacts with the aim of progressing the lebanese and syrians tracts if the palestinian front remains blocked believe that it is possible to achieve security on the lebanese and syrian borders with israel by an israeli withdrawal from the shabaa farms and the golan .
but full peace in the region can only be achieved by agreement between all the parties , the palestinian authority , syria and lebanon in particular , and with such an agreement , the problem of palestinian refugees would have been solved .
it may be that to achieve comprehensive peace in the region requires time and more effort . realizing security before achieving such a peace may be easier and closer to hand . if syria and lebanon do accept an israeli withdrawal from the shabaa farms and the golan in return for security along the length of the borders with israel , then negotiations for a comprehensive peace could take their time in an atmosphere of calm , security stability or truce .

" the electricity utility is bankrupt .
there is no complete plan for a remedy and , if there was , there would be a problem in securing the funds necessary to implement it . "
this is how the new director general of electricity chose to start his impossible tasks by shedding light on this gloomy situation , so that no - one will later say , " the responsibility lies wholly with the department . " for the department has just been handed a grounded cow , which the knives are working to bone , or at least those bones that remain .
we do not understand what it means for the public works and transport committee to announces its support for the new department when what is required is an emergency plan because the patching up which has taken place over the last two days will not last for more than three weeks . it is certain that we will return to the ' dark ' crisis .
if the story of the " life - belt " represents a difficulty that has yet to be resolved , despite the sufferings faced by the people in the bleak midwinter , what about the problem of collection or that of securing the funds necessary for the fuel ?
those responsible for the state finances and the public coffers , at the forefront of which stand fuad al-sinyurah , have the right , if not the duty , not to fund bankruptcy .
for , ultimately , they make unjustified payments with the people 's money to an institution hemorrhaging , consumed by extravagance , waste , negligence and inadequacy , to the extent that it has not the courage to collect its dues .
so as not to cause injustice to the poor employers of this institution , we say that it is political corruption , feudalism , favoritism and higher directives that have brought it to this downfall and bankruptcy , whilst owners of private generators , from the level of " abu naasah " and below , make profits and organize their electricity services excellently .
of course , kamal al-hayek and his colleagues in the new department deserve a chance to try to remedy the chronic semi - paralysis , but the costs of this opportunity are more than the financial capability of the state can bear and more than those people who pay the bills can imagine . they continue to pay , whilst others do not , causing the debts to rise , the burdens to accumulate and the impudent and sick state of bankruptcy to spread .
the opportunity that the new board of administration demands may cost about 400 million dollars , that is the cost of the fuel deficit for a period of ten months , and we do not know whether it is possible to improve collection to reduce this sum , which , by the way , secures a fixed and not a permanent current .
we know that corruption , regional strength , personal grip and the long arms that steal , plunder and forge will certainly prevent the introduction of a fair charge . the company does not who steal from its lines and who does not and how can we collect , and on what basis , from a feudal arrangement which has no meters ? we are certain that following up the matter of collection to its logical conclusion is tantamount to cutting off someone 's livelihood and the consequences thereof . the evidence for this lies in the words of the chairman of the public works and transport committee , deputy al-sidiq muhammad qabbani , yesterday , about the company being asked to impose a genuine charge by resorting to the security forces , for it was said in the past that these forces tarried and the company was asked to draft a report to demonstrate this but the report never arrived . for all of the above we urge the minister of finance not to pay one piastre unless there is a balanced plan to prevent loss and waste .
if hibco company , as it is said , wants 60 million dollars from the electricity utility in late payments for fuel and that it continues to secure ships using this debt on the basis of promises from president lahud and president al-hariri that they will receives their dues and that they must not plunge the country into an electricity crisis , then , if this is the case , and with all due respect to the eagerness of the president and prime minister to ensure the continuation of the electricity supply in the country , we say that we should not continue to incur debts to pay for the fuel , unless their excellencies are going to pay these millions from their own pockets .
we do not know how to interpret the words of deputy qabbani when he says , " it is the duty of the electricity utility to collect and to improve collection by any means , and if there is a need to use force , then let it be so . . . the legal and security agencies can be called upon . "
hasn 't there been a call to resort to the security and judicial forces ?
and what was the result ?
and if what is required of the board of directors of lebanon 's electricity , which they blamed yesterday and which they will blame tomorrow for the responsibility of this widespread scandal , that it reform political corruption in the lebanese republics tearing each other apart and put a stop to the chaos that extends from al-naqura to the great river ?
we do not know why people in lebanon are waiting to organize themselves into a silent and civilized revolution , initially to stop paying electricity bills and the concession companies hanging on to the mother company , at least so that we can see what those who do not pay or those who squander the current by virtue of social standing , force , authority , revolt or indolence , will do !

the observation made by the united nations special coordinator for the middle east peace process terry rod larsen in damascus following his meeting with senior syrian officials and shortly before he traveled to beirut , in which he pointed out that the shabaa farms were occupied syrian territory from the perspective of the security council , did not receive any comment either from the syrian foreign minister faruq al-sharaa or the syrian press , which usually writes what officials would not want to say in public .
it is not the content of what rod - larsen said , which is nothing new , that is worth noting - it has been stated on previous occasions and reiterated by un officials more than once , and syria knows the un position and the legal reasons on which it is based - but given that damascus had affirmed that the area is lebanese territory , one would have assumed , at least , not a response to rod - larsen but confirmation that syria stands firm in its position that the shabaa farms are lebanese .
meanwhile , rod - larsen 's words have left the impression that syria implicitly agrees with what he said . it did not deny it in the media , with the implications this has for protecting the right of resistance in operations it mounts in the shabaa farms and underlining lebanon 's right . nor has it refuted this in documents to the security council in the last two years .
this syrian refusal to enter into a debate about the shabaa farms that could be revived does not stem from damascus renouncing its adherence to the statement on the lebanese identity of the shabaa farms . nor , indeed , does it stem from a renunciation of its retention of resistance as a vital card until the peace talks resume and conclude , albeit that this card is no longer as effective as it was in the past . in fact , according to diplomatic sources , the syrian refusal to enter into debate is based on a whole raft of dues and considerations , at the forefront of which are :
1 ) that syria , with effect from the start of this year , has become a non - permanent member of the security council for a period of two years .
and the " prohibition " imposed on it has been lifted in order for it take up this seat , which it last occupied 30 years ago .
not to mention that its transformation into a member of this effective and influential organization carries with it a considerable amount of responsibility , which cannot be ignored .
the very least that is required of it is to participate in the efforts to combat terrorism , notwithstanding the fact that its understanding of the word may differ from that of the international organization , which it may subsequently attempt to amend , but it is certainly compelled to abide by its rules as long as it remains an active member of the organization .
given the implications of this commitment , it must also document the lebanese identity of the shabaa farms if it wants to refute the position adopted by and the resolutions passed by the united nations in this regard , namely that the farms are syrian and come under the supervision of undof and not unifil . it cannot simultaneously be a member of the security council and refute its resolutions .
this syrian refusal to discuss with rod - larsen this issue in public , according to what is known about his discussions with syrian officials , has in turn led to a lebanese refusal to enter into a similar debate , bearing in mind that rod - larsen reiterated in beirut that , from the perspective of the security council , the occupied shabaa farm land is syria , and this did not provoke the rancor of those concerned as it used to do .
2 ) the american openness in the first instance , and that of the west generally , towards syria on the basis of co - operation in the struggle against terrorism .
former american ambassador to syria edward djerejian did not fail to point out the large number of american congressional delegations visiting syria at this time , notwithstanding the fact that they are also visiting other arab states .
but the visits of american officials or united nations officials to damascus demonstrate the international interest in maintaining contact with syria , which sees , in light of the demands that have imposed themselves , notably since 11 september , an appropriate climate for it to benefit from the opportunity available to weave relations with the united states , relations which will keep it on the list of states co - operating with the united states in the war on terror in line with what american president george w . bush likes to describe as those states that are with the united states and the others that are with terrorism .
what was noticeable in the speech of the american president , and in the recent statements made by his national security adviser condoleezza rice , was their accusation against iran and hizbollah of involvement in the case of the ship smuggling weapons to the palestinians and the accusation made against iran of supporting terrorism without any reference or allusion to syria , bearing in mind that both iran and syria remain on the american list of states supporting terrorism .
this was explained by diplomatic sources as an encouraging distancing of syria and a spur towards greater cooperation in combating terrorism , especially following the noticeable calm in the shabaa farms , which is due to syria in the first instance .
two delegations from the american congress visited damascus last week . today a delegation headed by the democratic leader in the house richard gephardt , and next sunday the american ambassador to the united nations john negroponte is to visit .
3 ) the consequences of the 11 september attacks in the united states have imposed a review of syria 's list of priorities and we can say that what was prior to these attacks does not apply to what followed , although those concerned do not wish to affirm or announce the changes .
damascus knows and has studied these changes more than most countries . the evidence lies in the many signs it has shown after the pressure to disband hamas , islamic jihad and other islamic organizations with a presence in syria , for we can say that damascus has not literally abided by them , but nor has it ignored them either .
it is as if lebanon has not suffered enough abuse that it should turn the issue of its hosting the arab summit into a point of disagreement requiring the secretary - general of the arab league , amr musa , to tour several states to resolve the issue and settle , once and for all , the matter of the venue . even the attempts to put right the mistake appear fragmented , weak and unconvincing .
thus , whilst arab leaders , including the syrian president , confirmed to musa their decision to hold the summit in beirut , we find the threefold official lebanese position diffident , if not wrapped up in internal accounts and settling of scores .
the lebanese may have grown used to this from their leaders , and may not expect anything better , but the image put out to the arabs has inevitably lost much of its credibility , if not become a laughing stock .
the president of the republic says that he will dispatch ministers to deliver the invitations to arab leaders .
whilst the prime minister stresses that the council of ministers alone formulates lebanon 's political stance .
and we can deduce from musa 's statements that he found a warm welcome from the speaker of the chamber of deputies and a commitment to hold and an interest in the summit .
if this is true , then thank god and let us hope that musa succeeds in resolving the intricacies caused by the previous position of the speaker of the chamber of deputies , which have become problem in themselves .
but even this is insufficient to transform the official lebanese positions into a unified lebanese position , a strong and decisive stance in preparing to host the summit .
and this is what is required , especially if the real concern of the speaker of the chamber of deputies is the fear of the pressures that washington might bring to bear on the arabs to put an end to the resistance , whether in palestine or in lebanon .
why ?
because the arab summit is the best thing that could happen to a lebanon fearful of pressures , even when the syrian stances towards the summit topics , resistance and terrorism , are enough to dissipate , at very least , some of the lebanese fear .
in any case , a lebanon that is united and convinced of its position towards resistance needs the summit in order to ensure an arab position that supports it and goes beyond the mere formulation of such a position , in order to hold fast when the pressures brought to bear on it do increase . the alternative is for lebanon to find itself without effective arab cover when the pressures brought to bear on all the arabs increase .
such a position could be extracted from the arab leaders at a summit that brought them together in lebanon , provided that the lebanese position was unified , convincing and , above all else , governed by reason . by contrast , the fragmentation that prevails today makes this almost impossible , no matter where the summit is held .

india , pakistan 's traditional enemy , has helped to push pakistan , specifically its president , general parvez musharraf , to take the side of the united states in the war on taliban and bin ladin terror in the wake of the 11 september attacks , and to provide the military facilities the united states needs to win this war .
this has not been easy for musharraf because fundamentalist islamic currents have been active in his country for some time and they are capable of stirring up the streets of pakistan as and when they want , and because afghanistan 's former rulers quickly embraced these currents with the aim of deploying them in the struggle for kashmir with india and to encourage the taliban movement , which it conceived and assisted , to take control of afghanistan with the aim of deploying it in the same struggle .
but it happened because general musharraf found himself caught between two very difficult choices .
the first was to resist and fail to respond to the americans .
this would have put his country on the america list of terrorist targets to be struck and eliminated .
it would also have created the right conditions for india to settles it complex and long - standing accounts with pakistan .
and india has the capability to do this by virtue of its strength , advancement and the green light given to it by america .
the second was to respond to the americans and subsequently gain their varied support and guarantee their intervention at the appropriate moment to resolve the long - standing problems between india and pakistan , or at least prevent it from escalating and developing into a full - scale war .
naturally , musharraf could only choose the second option , which is what he did .
and then the preliminary results of the war against the taliban movement and al-qaeda became apparent , the most prominent of which were the removal of taliban rule and the break up of al-qaeda , and confirmed that he had made the right choice .
but does the recent deterioration in relations between india and pakistan , which has been translated into a massive mutual military mobilization and full preparation for war , mean that musharraf 's decision was not the right one ?
certainly not . the deterioration that has brought india and pakistan to the brink of a harsh conventional war , which could quickly develop into a non - conventional war if one or both of the two states found that their interest required this to avoid massive loss or defeat , has mobilized the streets of pakistan for a nationalist goal after they had been mobilized over the past few years , in particular the last four months , in pursuit of an islamist end . this has demonstrated that islamic fundamentalists could lead pakistan to disaster , which has allowed general musharraf to carry out what he has clearly labeled a " revolution " against the situation which had prevailed in his country for many years and it will allow him to turn pakistan into a moderate islamic state , one with an essential role to play in the region and in confronting terrorism there .
does this mean that all that is happening on the indian - pakistani borders is a scenario planned and scripted by the united states and performed by the rulers of these two hostile neighboring countries ?
many who follow the conditions in this region of the world , the international political conditions in particular , cannot stop themselves from saying in response that a meeting of interests took place between washington , new delhi and islamabad on a number of issues over this last period .
these included : an end to the internal challenges to musharraf 's regime in pakistan ; an end to the kashmiri - pakistani challenges to india ; the eradication of the pakistan atmospherics that allowed islamists and those accused of terrorism who came out from under their cloaks to expose the whole world to danger .
a meeting of interests is closer to reality than the scenarios and conspiracies that are formulated and prepared in dark , closed rooms .
but this meeting of interests is , on its own , insufficient to establish calm , even relative calm , between pakistan and india , to stabilize general musharraf 's regime and make him succeed in building a moderate islamic state . the united state must make this not a temporary meeting of interests , but one that is permanent and stable , and this is possible by several means , including rapid efforts on its part to resolve the problem of kashmir .
it is also possible by being generous with any aid required by pakistan .
will pakistan infect more islamic states that have participated directly or indirectly , deliberately or without intent , in strengthening and protecting what america labels as terrorism for there to be similar experiments in " moderation " ?
this is not easy because the conditions in one islamic state differ from those in another and because reason dictates that musharraf be given a reasonable amount of time to see whether his experiment will succeed .
it also requires that we wait to verify the sincerity of american support for such an experiment and for any similar experiment in the islamic world .

some days ago israeli seized a ship loaded with weapons and claimed that it had originated from iran and was heading for palestine to support the intifada .
israeli intercepted the vessel at 500 km distance from the israeli coast on the red sea .
israel quickly exploited the incident to provoke a storm in which it accused the palestinian authority , iran and hizbollah of smuggling weapons to the palestinians , whilst stressing that the arrival of the weapons was a clear breach of the atmosphere of calm which american was trying to induce and which chairman of the palestinian authority yasir arafat had accepted , announcing a ceasefire against the israeli occupation in return for a return to the negotiating table . note that the commitment to maintain calm was unilateral , from the palestinian side , whilst israel is free to behave as if it were not so bound and hardly a day passes without new israeli crimes : the killing of palestinian young men ; the destruction of homes in the palestinian refugee camp in south gaza , which left dozens of families sleeping in the open air ; and the complete destruction of gaza airport .
america , as usual , rushes to justify israeli savagery : secretary of state colin powell declares that these israeli attacks are no more than defensive measures .
this horrific situation causes us to raise a number of questions , the most of which are as follows :
first , from where did israeli obtain the authorization to intercept shipping outside of its regional waters , at a distance of 500 km from its coast ?
does this mean that israel is monitoring all shipping in the red sea ?
what is the position of states overlooking the red sea , including the kingdom of saudi arabia , egypt , yemen and jordan , towards this incident ?
the palestinian authority has denied involvement with this arms shipment and hizbollah has mocked the spurious charged directed against it .
secondly , what crazy arab would try to send a ship loaded with weapons to palestine when it is known by everyone that all palestine 's coasts fall under direct israeli control ?
where could the cargo have been offloaded without passing under israeli observation ?
is it not possible that this incident has been fabricated by israel to condemn and embarrass the palestinian authority before international public opinion and make it responsible for challenging the american initiative to put an end to the violence in the occupied territories ?
it is perhaps no coincidence that this incident should occur on the eve of the arrival of the american representative ( zaini ) to the region .
is there anyone who can dismiss the possibility that this tale has been spun from the ideas of israeli intelligence , mossad ?
thirdly , should the palestinians say sorry for trying to obtain individual weapons that are well past their sell - by date when israel is continuously supplied by america with the most advanced military technology , including f - 16 fighters , apache helicopters , heavy tanks , missiles , heavy bombs and other weapons of death and destruction ?
notwithstanding the great gulf that separates the palestinian position of resisting the occupation of its territory and the confiscation of its liberty from that of israel , which deploys all these weapons to retain territory it has captured , put an end to palestinian right to self - determination and finish off the palestinian question , which is supposed to be the arabs ' central issue .
is this approach in line with the values for which america calls , namely liberty , democracy and human rights ?
or is america determined not to give to others what it wants for itself ?
what does it mean for america to deny the palestinian right to obtain these values ?
in any case , we believe that the palestinian intifada does not need weapons to achieve its aims .
for at its very beginning the intifada was not an armed revolution , but one that was armed with nothing but rocks .
and no matter how much palestinian weaponry develops it will never reach the same level as that of israel .
thus for the palestinians to bet on weapons is to back a certain loser .
the scene of the child muhammad durrah being martyred had greater impact in the world than any subsequent armed operation carried out by palestinian resistance .
the intifada must continue and honorable civil resistance must escalate , armed with demonstrations , sit - ins , media campaigns and an embargo against israel .
this presupposes the absolute solidarity of all arabs with the intifada , with massive demonstrations , widespread media campaigns and a comprehensive and total pan - arab embargo against israel , from the ocean to the gulf .
in our view the two arab states who have made a settlement with israel and are now linked by normalized relations with it in all areas have a special responsibility in this regard .
the palestinian revolutions must , in other words , be the revolution of all arabs .
if the palestinian question were relabeled as a pan - arab issue , it would be because the fate of the arab nation and all of its peoples depends on the fate of the palestinian question .
if the arab peoples are currently anaesthetized or suppressed , then day must follow this night .
if the weapons ship is a scandal , it should be a scandal for israel .
are not the savage israeli operations against civilians , leaving dozens of palestinian refugee families homeless , terrorist acts ?
so why does america support israel and justify these operations ?
doesn 't america know that this stance only supports terrorism , the terrorism of the state of israel , whilst the war on terror spreads all over the globe ?
what is regrettable is that the palestinian authority behaves as if it were defeated and had surrendered , which is the greatest threat to the palestinian intifada .
i have known jan ghanim since the beginning of the 1980s , if not before then , through friends and acquaintances in hamana as " jano " , the name that stuck with him until his death ,
president bashir al-jamil , for whom jan ghanim was his right - hand man , used to call him jano . former minister ilyas habiqah before becoming leadership of the " lebanese forces " used to call him jano , as did dr samir jaajaa , despite the differences between the two men .
jan ghanim , aged 57 , was a good friend even to his political opponents . he was the most flexible of his contemporaries in the kataib and the " forces " , and more recently in the al-waad party , even at the height of the political confusion in 1992 when he stood for election and won on the votes of those other than his own supporters , who boycotted the elections . the same happened during the elections of 1996 .
jan ghanim remained as he was . he did not change and the smile remained on his face for all to see .
he came to prominence in his parliamentary activities with the national defense and health committees .
but he lost the 2000 elections and the relationship between him and his colleague ilyas habiqah , who also lost in the elections , was lukewarm .
jan 's name was most obvious during the war with the establishment of the four party security committee , in which his name was a permanent fixture as representative of the " forces " . he accompanied the two representatives of " amal " , ( deputy ) ayub hamid and ahmad baalbaki , and the two representatives of the progressive socialist party , ( deputy ) akram shahib and said al-dawi .
all were active with the army representatives staff brigadier jan nasif , moving from barricade to another , attempting in vain to stop the war and remove the barricades .
from the security committee to the brigade headquarters , where he took part in the uprising of the " forces " on 12 march 1985 against party leader at the time aili karamah , along side habiqah and jaajaa . from that time the kataib and the " forces " came to be on separate sides .
ghanim 's star continued to shine in the party and political arena . on 28 december 1985 he headed for damascus to witness his friend , ilyas habiqah , director of the executive authority in the " forces " , sign the tripartite agreement with the leader of the amal movement ( speaker ) nabih birri and leader of the progressive socialist party ( deputy ) walid janbalat , under senior syrian patronage and in the presence of a number of prominent lebanese witnesses .
but the tripartite agreement did not continue . a dispute arose between the director of the executive authority of the " forces " and the chief of staff samir jaajaa . jaajaa led the uprising against habiqah on 15 january 1986 , which resulted in his victory and in habiqah being forced to leave lebanon for paris accompanied by ghanim and a number of the executive authority staff , and from there to damascus and zahlah until 1990 , when he returned to beirut . his return coincided with the beginning of implementation of the taif accord , the removal of the military wing of the " forces " and the work to found the al-waad party .
jan ghanim , a doctor specializing in diabetes and gland disorders , believed in freedom of opinion and kept on good terms with everyone , which is why friends gathered around him from all sides .
jan ghanim 's heart stopped yesterday at the heart of jesus hospital following a coma that had lasted for about two weeks as a result of a traffic accident in al-hazimiyyah .
and whilst jan ghanim may have closed his eyes , the smile will remain on his face , which never frowned .
* speaker of the chamber of deputies nabih birri and members of the chamber lamented the death of former deputy ghanim . prayers will be said for the repose of his soul at 2 pm today in the al-mukhallis church in his hometown of hamana .
a short piece about him was distributed and included the following : " former deputy dr jan ghanim , born in hamana in 1945 , completed his studies at the aintura institute , before joining luvan university in belgium to study medicine .
he graduated as a doctor specializing in treating diabetes and glandular disorders in 1975 from lyons university in france .
he returned to lebanon where he practiced medicine in various hospitals , including sainte charles and baabda , as well as various clinics in the district of baabda during the war years and thereafter .
he was one of the al-kataib party leaders and representative of the " lebanese forces " in the security committee during the war . his priority was a ceasefire , the liberation of prisoners and tending to the wounds .
he was the subject of assassination attempts and was injured whilst trying to calm the fighting at the contact lines between disputing parties .
he called for the unity of lebanon , an end to violence and war , and rejected sectarianism .
he stood for a seat as a deputy in the district of baabada in 1992 and 1996 and won on both occasions .
he was unsuccessful in reaching the chamber of deputies in the last elections .
he worked in the council of deputies in the health and defense committee within the framework of the deputies committees , and won the wounded and war medals of the french red cross in 1985 .
for more than 25 years he worked in humanitarian and health services at disability centers and clinics .
he died yesterday ( monday ) , 14 / 01 / 2002 , following a traffic accident about two weeks ago which left him in a coma .
by khalil falihan :
ministerial sources have reported that lebanon has rejected a proposal from secretary - general of the arab league amr musa to postpone what he has termed since his arrival at beirut airport on sunday afternoon " confirmation of the summit venue " .
they mentioned that more than one minister who had met with musa since his arrival at his headquarters in the phoenicia hotel had felt that he was portraying the summit venue as a problem and giving the libyan proposal more leeway than was necessary , bearing in mind that the written support of djibouti for the proposal did not require any delay in setting the date .
they noted that , during a press conference at the hotel following his meeting with minister of culture ghassan salamah , he had been careful to refer to the increased number of countries who had informed him orally that " they had no objection to holding the summit in cairo and not in beirut " .
they revealed that these countries , the names of which musa had passed on to the official he had met , were : sudan , somalia and qatar .
they said that as far as qatar was concerned , the matter was not certain because the embassy in beirut had contacted an official to enquire about hotels and reservations from now for members of its delegation to the 14th regular arab summit .
however , musa 's attempt to persuade officials of the importance of waiting for the results of what he termed " quiet arab diplomacy " on the pretext of taking the positions of these countries into consideration , had been officially fenced off at a senior level . this was not just by simple rejection of the attempt , but by issuing of two statements . the first emerged from the republican palace and included a list of 8 ministers sent to the president of the republic emil lahud to pass on letters and invitations to arab kings , presidents and princes even before the secretary - general reached baabda and whilst he was meeting with prime minister rafiq al-hariri , who also issued a written statement confirming , like lahud , lebanon 's concern that all arab leaders should take part in the summit and lebanon 's determination to hold it on its territory .
they noted that al-hariri 's statement had greater detail than that issued from baabda and focused on the point that the lebanese council of ministers " alone was responsible for formulating lebanon 's political positions " .
it also stressed " lebanon 's firm adherence to the importance of col. muammar gaddafi attending " the summit .
the statements issued by lahud and al-hariri were judged to be an official public response to musa and to libya 's attempts , which were based on a significant maneuver with a major arab country , according to information available to officials about what libyan agents at the arab league were doing under the leadership of abd al-munaim al-huni .
they said that that the statements issued by the president of the republic and the prime minister had headed off the justifications brought by musa , on the basis that messengers had begun to pack their bags to deliver the letters and that lebanon was keen to welcome the libyan leader .
they indicated that al-hariri 's statement had not surprised musa given that contacts had been held with him as to its contents .
he had asked for an official statement from the prime minister since he regarded what al-hariri said at a press conference in brussels with president of the european commission , romano prodi , about lebanon 's concern for gaddafi 's attendance , as no more than a press statement .
they believed that the prime minister had gone further than was necessary in his official statement , since musa had not asked for gaddafi to be named .
they responded to musa 's fears that the threats directed against col. gaddafi were not insignificant and should be taken seriously by saying , " the security measures being put in place aim to protect all those participating , notably the leaders of the delegations .
there are no exceptions and the security forces , including the army , the internal security forces , general security and the state security service , will implement these measures with the involvement of land , sea and air forces .
no one will be allowed to enter the " red zone " where the conference is to be held , namely the phoenicia hotel .
no one will be allowed to enter without official permission .
they did not wish to predict the effect of the two statements on the libyan leadership , and before them on musa , wishing instead to focus on actual preparations for the summit in beirut on the 27th and 28th of next march .
they noted that musa had increased the number of his statements since arriving . on the first day he had given two statements and a press talk . on the second day he had given four statements , containing some contradictions .
deputy prime minister isam faris yesterday visited speaker of the chamber of deputies , nabih birri , and discussed the developments with him .
faris provided birri with the atmospherics to the visit he will make at the start of next week to russia . the speaker hoped that " he would confirm to the leader of the russian duma the invitation to visit lebanon that he had previously made to him when they met " .
faris chaired a meeting of the ministerial committee charged with studying the general contracts law and the project to define the powers of the tenders departments , to amend the holders thereof and to draft a new tenders system .
president of editors syndicate milham karam yesterday met at the association 's headquarters with iranian ambassador muhammad ali subhani and first advisor at the embassy abu al-hasan zaafari in the presence of a number of members of the association 's board .
subhani invited karam to participate in an islamic conference to be held in tehran on the 29th and 30th of january entitled " the international conference for media in the islamic world to support the intifada " .
the invitation was addressed from the director of radio and television iran in collaboration with the iranian ministry of foreign affairs .
maronite patriarch cardinal mar nasrallah butrus safir yesterday met in bikirki with members of the " popular decision block " , deputies faris buiz , farid al-khazin and abbas hashim .
following the meeting buiz said , " the visit was to exchange felicitations on the feasts with the patriarch . of course , it was an opportunity to discuss the matters from which the country suffers and complains , whether these be political or economic , or relate to the people 's circumstances and services . i believe that the conclusion of the discussion was that we have arrived at a catastrophic economic situation in the country . "
chairman of the american congressional delegation , and leader of the minority democrats therein , richard gephardt believed that " achieving peace is very important for lebanon and the united states " . he stressed the need to fight terrorism " because it destroys and spreads chaos " , noting that " lebanon has witnessed terrorist acts and has been affected by terrorism perhaps more than any other country " .
the american congressional delegation led by gephardt and members of congress believed
the roman orthodox metropolitan of beirut , archbishop ilyas udah , met yesterday morning at the headquarters of the archbishopric with minister of the interior and municipalities ilyas al-murr , who said , " i visit archbishop ilyas every two or three weeks to see how he is and to discuss political and social issues of concern to the lebanese , particularly the orthodox . "
he was asked what they had discussed in the meeting .
he answered , " the fact is that the archbishop is preoccupied with many things during the period of the feasts and we have not met since three weeks . there was a need for a long meeting , but i stress that it is the heart that is talking . "
on the arab summit he said , " my basic comment is that security in lebanon is excellent , if the pretext is security . "
i have known jan ghanim since the beginning of the 1980s , if not slightly before that , through friends and close associates in hamana , by the name of " jano " , the name which stuck until his death .
president bashir al-jamil , for whom jan ghanim was his right - hand man , called him " jano " . former minister ilyas habiq used to call him " jano " from before the time he became leader of the lebanese forces and dr samir jaajaa , despite the differences between them , also called him " jano " .
jan ghanim , aged 57 , was a good friend even to his political opponents and was the most flexible of his contemporaries and peers in the military units and forces and finally in the al-waad party even at the height of the political confusion in 1992 when he stood for election and won on the votes of those other than his own group by virtue of their boycott , and again in the 1996 elections .
jan ghanim remained as he was , without changing . the smile remained on his face for all to see .
he became prominent in his parliamentary activities with the national defense and health committees .
he came across as a senior official authority , giving reassurance that lebanese american relations had not been affected by the differences in views on terrorism .
files that were opened by the judiciary during the government of president al-hiss and then frozen have not yet been closed .
the words of speaker birri with american ambassador vincent patel in an earlier meeting and the arab league secretary general amr musa on regional affairs did not correlate .
following his meeting yesterday with prime minister rafiq al-hariri , minister of the economy basil falihan confirmed , " the partnership agreement with the european union will strengthen economic relations with europe and open its markets to lebanese products . "
after al-hariri had evaluated with him the benefits anticipated from the agreement , which was signed a few days ago in europe , he said , " we have initialed the partnership agreement with the european union and , god willing , it will finally be signed in three months time and start to have automatic effect , because lebanon has agreed with the european union to sign a phased agreement so that all the commercial provisions will take effect on final signature and , god willing , the agreement will take effect within 3 or 4 months and we will start to feel its impact . "
asked about the importance of the agreement , he answered , " the importance of the agreement is , firstly , that it strengthens economic relations between europe and lebanon and opens the european market to lebanese agricultural , industrial and food industry products . this will take effect on the first day of final signature because the agreement is phased . there is no doubt that lebanon will , in the sixth year following signature of the agreement , begin gradually to reduce customs duties . what is important in this context is that we will begin to reduce our duties on european products after we have realized and implemented in full the arab free trade zone agreement . there will thus be a liberalization of trade with all the arab states before our duties are reduced in relation to europe . thus lebanon will be capable of confronting the coming challenges from european competition within a framework of the greater arab trade area . "
al-hariri met with minister of labor ali qansu , followed by minister of energy and water muhammad abd al-hamid and minister of state michel faruun .
he then met with deputy ayub hamid , followed by director general of state security , maj. gen. ( staff ) edward mansur and artist mansur al-rahbani .

leader of the progressive socialist party , deputy walid junbulat expressed his fear at the " major deterioration in the economic and social situations " , calling for " the necessity of creating at least a bare minimum of solutions in order for citizens to stand firm in light of the present situation " .
junbulat said this during his tour of a number of villages in the region of al-kharub , during which he met some owners of industrial firms , which have been recently closed by their owners , notably in the village of burja , due to the economic deterioration , increasing production cost and foreign competition .
a number of agriculturalists from the same area brought the same complaint to junbulat and told him that they could not face up to foreign products constantly sweeping the markets and damaging local agriculture .
junbulat 's tour included the villages of shahim , katrmaya , al-wardaniyyah and burja . ala taru and the progressive party representative of the al-kharub region munir al-sayyid accompanied him .
junbulat held meetings with the people of these villages in the presence of the village leaders , notables and chiefs . he heard the suffering of the people , which centered on the living and economic conditions , the problem of power cuts and " haphazard and often unjust legislation " .
they also discussed the late payment of compensation and dues to those displaced and the follow - up of the technical committees in a large number of villages .
junbulat concluded his tour with a meeting held in the village of al-dabiyah , attended by deputy nabil al-bustani , and with a visit to the church of jadra village , accompanied by head of the village council father joseph al-qazzi .
junbulat is known to have discussed the demands of the al-kharub region with prime minister rafiq al-hariri during their meeting yesterday .
director of political affairs at the ministry of foreign affairs and expatriates , ambassador naji abi asi yesterday began exercising his functions as secretary - general of the agency . former secretary - general zuhair himdan , who has retired on reaching the legal age , continues in his office until the end of this january as part of the handover .
a ministry source did not give a decisive indication on the possibility of the council of ministers giving a decision this week on the appointment of a permanent secretary - general or whether this would be deferred on the grounds that it relates to other outstanding appointments .
it indicated that abu asim was the most promising in view of his professional competence , especially after the proposal to appoint an alternative from outside the holders of foreign affairs positions was dropped .
deputy chairman of the supreme popular islamic council , sheikh abd al-amir qablan met with a delegation from the national union of associations contracted with the ministry of social affairs under the leadership of tawfiq asiran and informed him of his movements .
qablan had contacts with minister of social affairs asad diab and discussed with him ways of dealing with the issue of contracting parties .
the media office of scholar mr muhammad hussein fadlallah reported that fadlallah had fallen ill on his return from damascus where he had given advanced lessons at the al-murtada precincts . he has been forced to remain in bed on the instructions of the physician treating him .
the following clarification has reached us from the media office at the kuwait embassy :
" the al-nahar newspaper published on monday 14 january 2002 acquainted us with a letter from an official in the press department at the iraqi embassy , minister plenipotentiary khalid jaafar shawish entitled : inaccurate statements .
his response followed the tour by the national committee for kuwaiti prisoners and missing persons in iraq to the area led by dr muhammad al-haddad , member of the national committee , which is chaired by shaikh salim al-sabah .
al-shawish says that the kuwaiti statements are inaccurate when the issue of the prisoners is the one of most concern to kuwait and at the top of its priorities . iraq , meanwhile , ignores all the humanitarian calls for their fate to be revealed . it further ignores all international decisions and security council resolutions concerning the prisoners , which stipulate that they be freed without restriction or condition ( resolution 686 ( 1991 ) , paragraph ( c ) ; resolution 687 / 1991 , paragraph 30 ; and resolution 1284 / 1999 ) .
how can out statements be inaccurate when kuwait has submitted the documents left behind by the iraqi forces defeated by kuwait to the united nations , which reports prove that the iraqi regime did arrest a number of kuwaitis and arabs and other nationals , whom it transported to iraqi territory on the instruction of the national command ?
iraq 's non - attendance at the official meetings from the end of 1991 to mid - 1994 has slowed the search process .
similarly , iraq has boycotted meetings of the tripartite committee since 1998 .
how can our statements be inaccurate when there is nothing dearer to us , the kuwaitis , than to reach a realistic formula to end this humanitarian disaster , which has been on - going for 11 years and which has affected more than 600 kuwaiti and arab households ?
why does iraq not return to the geneva convention and the tripartite committee to end the suffering of our people and our prisoners ?
why does iraq propose to amend the membership of the tripartite committee , which was agreed upon from the start ?
if iraq is sincere in co - operating on this humanitarian issue , it must first attend the committee meetings !
how can the statements of kuwaiti officials be inaccurate when a number of arab officials have tried to involve themselves as mediators in this matter and were accepted , unfortunately with procrastination , postponement and falsification of the facts by the iraqi side ? perhaps syrian president bashar al-asad and the former secretary - general of the arab league ismat abd al-majid know the truth of the matter .
we would remind mr al-shuwaish that he is forgetting the results of dr abd al-majid 's efforts and his repeated visits to the iraqi capital , from which he would return with empty hands as a result of the obstinacy of the iraqi officials and their lack of cooperation , exactly as the international committee of the red cross did !
mr al-shuwaish says that iraq lost the prisoners in kuwait .
how can it have prisoners lost in kuwait when it occupied kuwaiti territory by force , thereby breaking laws and international norms , international law and the geneva convention ?
the occupying forces ( and the iraqi regime in this instance ) are responsible for the conditions , the inhabitants and the prisoners of war in the occupied territory .
yes , kuwait has prisoners in iraq , as is established by the documents submitted to the united nations .
we are the sorrier because our prisoners are people of kuwait and from among our arab brothers .
how can iraq want to turn a new page , when arab fraternity , an arab right and arab dialogue have been violated for more than 11 years , when we are on the point of an arab summit and are in greatest need of arab solidarity .
mr al-shuwaish says that iraq took the initiative to effect a positive resolution of the issue under the aegis of the arab league and under the supervision of the international committee of the red cross , and that iraq has 1137 files relating to the number of iraqi prisoners in kuwait .
and at this juncture we would remind iraq that the files on these missing persons only appeared in 1994 .
how can kuwait have prisoners when the iraqi forces were occupying kuwaiti territory ?
and in control of it ?
what is striking is that the iraqi regime should remember that it has 1137 missing iraqis in kuwait six years after kuwait 's liberation .
1137 or 1124 ?
the iraqi official does not know the correct figure : on 5 october 2001 a statement published by the al-nahar newspaper reported that iraqi has 1124 missing persons , whilst he now says that the number is 1137 .
which is the right number ?
if iraq is prepared to turn over this painful page from our history , why does it not cooperate with the tripartite committee , which was convened with the approval and participation of , and under the aegis of the united nations pursuant to security council resolutions 686 ( 1991 ) and 1284 ( 1998 ) , and is permitted to investigate this humanitarian issue ?
our brothers in iraq : just one prisoner with an arab brother or neighbor is equivalent to the prisoners of a nation in its entirety .
will iraq show us its good intent by cooperating with representative of the secretary - general charged with the kuwaiti prisoners and other nationals , ambassador yuli foronotsov , and cooperate with the secretary - general of the arab league , amr musa , who is preparing to visit iraq as part of an arab tour to bring about the success of the arab summit ?
at the invitation of the association of al-butrun village leaders ( " al-nahar " ), village leaders from the province met for dinner at the samarna restaurant in the town of samar jubail . deputies butrus harb and sayid aql , governor of the north nasif qalush , head of the maronite archdiocese of al-butrun archbishop bulus emil saada , administrative officer for al-butrun ilham al-duwaihi al-hajj , and a number of officials from the al-butrun and duma offices attended .

* the emergency workshop in tripoli municipality ( " al-nahar " ) completed the repair and maintenance of the road parallel to the al-mulula bridge leading to al-qubba . it had been closed for a month due to a fracture in the al-shifa water main and works uncompleted by the contractor .
the municipal police opened this link road to cars under the supervision of the head of the municipality samir shaarani after the emergency workshop repaired the fractured water main in cooperation with the tripoli water department and prepared the road to reduce congestion .
shaarani clarified that the municipality had taken this step to rescue the situation and had opened the road after the contractor , who is responsible for surfacing the road and completing the works , had closed it .
he asked those responsible for infrastructure works in the city to implement projects as per the specifications in the conditions documents . he noted that the municipality had the right to supervise projects in order to preserve public safety .
he hoped not to be forced to take preventative measures against those in breach .
* the municipality of al-duwair ( al-nabatiyyah ) called inhabitants of the town who wished to surface their private roads , from which three or more homes would benefit within the jurisdiction of the municipality , to submit applications at the municipality headquarters for an inspection and subsequent surfacing .
it also asked those who wished to do this to append to their application a map showing the road , a notice of ownership and a document showing the record of the person concerned , in addition to a certificate of acquittal from the municipality . it noted that the maximum road surfacing should not exceed 120 meters in length and 3.80 meters in width for private roads . the maximum for public roads should not exceed 180 meters and 3.80 meters in width .
the official national media agency yesterday quoted an investigation into the land of the town of al-adisah ( authorities ) , which contained the following :
" despite one and a half years passing since the drawing of the international southern border , which was carried out by the united nations , following the israeli withdrawal from southern lebanon , and the establishment of the so - called " blue line " , which was accompanied at the time by lebanon expressing reservations about territory from which israel had not withdrawn , in particular in the towns of al-adisah , ramish and al-ghajar - al-abbasiyyah " , a problem confronts the inhabitants of al-adisah : their inability to gain access to 3000 dunums of their agricultural land due to the international force closing the areas and agricultural land which separates their town from the israeli settlement of maskafaam with barbed wire left behind by the israelis . in addition , an iron gate has been set up across the road which links the town with the land referred to and surrounded by barbed wire and mine fields , thereby indirectly making it a buffer zone and line of defense for the israeli settlement . entry to this territory requires prior permission from the headquarters of the international force in al-naqurah due to security concerns and on account of the mine fields .
a number of lebanese journalists managed to enter this territory after crossing the iron gate and traveling over roads surfaced by the israeli forces and used by the indian battalion for its vehicles on their way to the site facing maskafaam settlement . they reached the south - eastern heights of al-adisah , close to the blue line , which has been marked with blue paint on a surfaced road , but did not cross it , at a distance of 50 meters from the dividing line , which lebanese civilians have reached for the first time since the israeli occupation in 1976 .
on these heights , the israelis established massive military sites where they erected columns on which reconnaissance equipment was fixed , surrounded by barbed wire and minefields . a state of readiness was apparent among the occupying soldiers within the fortified area , and a military vehicle roamed the area .
from the other side , two units from the indian battalion advanced to the area of the iron gate and prevented a number of inhabitants of al-adisah from crossing without prior permission .
commenting on this , deputy qasim hashim said , ".. . since the united nations declared the blue line following the withdrawal of israeli forces , lebanon has expressed reservations at this situation at more than one point , predominantly the shabaa farms and the kafr shuba hills , in addition to various areas of land along the blue line , notably that of the town of al-adisah . .."
deputy nazih mansurah said , " this territory , which was occupied prior to 1988 , about which the lebanese government has expressed reservation with regard to the larsen line , but which he did not notice , and , as deputies of the area , we are keen to restore all the territory because the blood that has watered this land cannot be wasted . "
head of the municipality osama rammal said , " we are about to mount a popular movement to restore the land , which the international committee prevents us from entering , as a minimum for obtaining our land , and we will do this in agreement with the relevant lebanese authorities . "
village leader khalil rammal clarified , " there are 3000 dunums of the village 's land still cut off by the israeli occupation . it is located in the south - eastern area of the village in al-khalali and al-uwja , parallel to the maskafaam settlement , on which houses for settlers have been constructed .
the israelis occupied 1800 dunums in 1976 and reoccupied 1200 dunums in 1983 .
we demand the return of our land so that the people can farm it , live there and secure their children 's future , especially in these difficult economic conditions , and we call on the officials and international authorities to stand by us ; otherwise , there will come the day when we will have to do something to secure the return of our land .
we are not scared of the mines , about which they speak , even though we do not believe that there are mines in the land , other than in a specific area which we know well . "
the weather prevailing over lebanon for the last three days has been cloudy at times , clear at others . the cold has been everywhere , whether ice in the peaks or very cold air on the coasts .
this may not continue for long , however , on account of the rapid changes in the winds , which determine weather conditions .
the winds have been northwesterly or northeasterly over the last three days , and they only bring a little rain to this area . we must wait for change .
according to the records of the nicola shahin observatory , the amount of rain falling in january 2001 was just 46 mm . the amount of rainfall falling this january to date is 114 mm with snow covering the areas to a height of 580 meters . last year snow only covered heights of 1200 meters and above .
the total rainfall this year is 399 mm , which compares with 192 mm for this time last year .
the general accumulative rate to this date in year is 462 mm .
air pressure yesterday evening was 768 millimeters of mercury ; humidity was 71 % and the temperature 14 degrees .
from these figures it can be concluded that it is possible the rain may return once more with effect from this evening , but it will be light rain .
it may continue or stop on account of the wind , which plays with the weather as it wishes .
the temperature expected on the coast will range from 11 to 17 degrees , in the mountains from 5 to 10 degrees , and in the beqaa from 0 to 6 degrees .
the human rights for lebanon organization ( cedar watch ) has recorded various violations of freedoms and human rights in lebanon at the start of the new year , including " the directorate of general security forcing the al-sharq al-awsat newspaper to undergo censorship prior to distribution , tens of the directorate forces storming two virgin megastores in beirut and zuq mikhail and confiscating more than 600 audio and video tapes . . . and the continuation of the campaign of summoning activists from oppositionist organizations , especially the ' lebanese forces ' ".
it reported , " a number of members of the force were recently summoned to army intelligence centers in beirut and other areas , where they were subject to investigation and banned from conducting any political activity . they include claufis shwaifaty , charle gris , george al-alam , ibrahim muslim , george shahadah , ilyano al-mir and ghazi jaajaa . "
it called on the lebanese authorities and the security agencies " to stop these practices " .
they demanded that the public prosecutor for cassation , justice adnan adum , " change his mind with respect to his recent arrangement , by which he rendered terrorist operations , organization of demonstrations and the distribution of political leaflets one and the same " .
ice has taken over the roads , obstructed traffic and caused the closure of schools in the peaks after pupils were unable to reach them without slipping .
in the desolate area of aliyyah and al-matan al-ala ( " al-nahar " ) snow - ploughing and road - opening operations have continued , notably in kafr al-salwan , hamdun al-mahattah , hamdun al-dayaah , balshamaiya , aliyyah and the villages of the " hamdun - al-jard al-ala union " .
all main and international roads in the administrative areas of aliyyah and baabda have been cleared .
for the third day the cold wave has continued . temperatures in aliyyah and al-matan reached the highest levels seen by the two areas for a long time .
as the snow remains by the roadside , it melts during the day and turns to ice from 6 pm .
for this reason , most of the schools in aliyyah and the area of al-jard and al-matan al-ala closed .
maintenance teams from the ministry of public works continued to distribute large quantities of salt on the international road and main roads linking aliyyah , al-matan and al-shawf .
the amount of salt spread is estimated at about 25 tons . in the early hours , this action helped the ice to interact with the salt and it began to melt at about 10 am , depending on the height of the area and the thickness of the ice from one area to another .
the schools of jazin ( " al-nahar " ) and the surrounding area were closed for the second week on account of the snowstorm and ice .
pupils were unable to reach their schools in the morning out of fear of slipping .
movement in the town was also paralyzed until 11 am .
it is expected that government and private schools will reopen today but not before 9:30 am , once the heat of the sun has melted most of the ice .
after the storm departed , more material losses became apparent to the woodland resources in the area of jazin , especially the forest of bakasin , which has many productive pine trees .
one week after the snowstorm the opening of all mountain village roads in the area of rashiya ( " al-nahar ) was completed ; however , the accumulation of ice on most of them , has prevented citizens from moving about early in the day . school pupils only reached their schools at 10:00 am .
only the hasbiya - rashiya road via ain ata remains closed because no one has tried to open it .
pupils of the village , who are studying at the al-kafir government secondary school called on the relevant authorities to give the necessary instructions for it to be opened .
at the invitation of the association of al-butrun village leaders ( " al-nahar " ), village leaders from the province met for dinner at the samarna restaurant in the town of samar jubail . deputies butrus harb and sayid aql , governor of the north nasif qalush , head of the maronite archdiocese of al-butrun archbishop bulus emil saada , administrative officer for al-butrun ilham al-duwaihi al-hajj , and a number of officials from the al-butrun and duma offices attended .

israeli military aircraft violated lebanese airspace for the second day yesterday , and broke the sound barrier in beirut and tripoli .
the guidance directorate in the army command issued the following statement : " today , at 10:25 , 8 israeli military aircraft breached lebanese airspace and circled above the areas in the south , beirut and mt lebanon , heading north .
they then departed in the direction of the occupied territories at 11:25 . "
elsewhere , the united nations media office issued the following statement : " after a calm that has lasted 10 days , 9 israeli military aircraft breached the blue line on three occasions on sunday , the 13th of the present month of january .
mr stefan de mistura , personal representative of the united nations secretary - general in southern lebanon , noted , with all regret , the resumption of these air violations , and demanded that israeli authorities put an end to them . "
the " al-nahar " correspondent in hasbiya reported that the military aircraft circled over al-bildah , rashiya , the western beqaa , in addition to the international borders and the occupied area of the shabaa farms . they circled four times over the farms land .
the israelis have intensified their mechanized patrols near the critical strip between occupied syria area of al-ghajar and maghar shabaa .
ukkar - " al-nahar "
the head of the roman orthodox archdiocese of ukkar , archbishop bulus bandali honored the following syrian and lebanese security leaders in ukkar at a " friendly dinner " held in their honor at a restaurant : col. ( staff ) muhammad muflih , responsible for syrian security ; lt. col. bassam al-ayyubi , commander of ukkar regional police company ; lt col. antwan makkari , responsible for state security ; and lt. yusif abdallah , responsible for the general security center in halba .
* citizens from qashu ' street in al-ashrafiyyah al-ghaitawi , and residents in about 30 buildings , have complained at the ongoing power cut due to excessive demand and the inability of the transformer to cope with the power required for over two years . the situation deteriorated with the snowstorms . their visits to the utility in order to strengthen the transformer have been in vain and they have demanded a solution to their problem .
citizens from the al-makhul street , in the farah , qansu and abu shaqra buildings , have complained about the power cuts , which continue for several hours , when the supply is available in neighboring streets . they have demanded that it be provided in theirs .
citizens from the area of al-tayunah , ragheb allama street , have complained of a fault in the wires leading to their quarter . their contacts with the repairs department in order to put the fault right have been unsuccessful and they have asked for power to be made available .
* " division 19 " was in permanent contact with the electricity company for two days , but the numbers for the repair department were permanently busy or perhaps out of order .
as regards the 145 number , set aside for complaints , we have contacted it on more than one occasion but the member of staff said that the officer was not there , that she could not do anything and that the officer would attend later .
at this time , it also became apparent that the officer was absent and that the person charged with dealing with division 19 complaints in the company had been transferred to another , unspecified directorate .
faced with this regrettable situation , and in light of the absence of any official that one could contact at the company to deal with complaints , they must be published as they are until such time as the absent officer responds to them and resolves them .
from michel jurji sadqa :
" from more than two years and three months , i subscribed to the al-shiffa jubail water utility ( subscription number 91817 , dated 08 / 09 / 1999 ) , but i have had no water in more than 3 months .
i repeatedly contacted those responsible at the utility , but they have done nothing despite their promises to me .
for two months , and following persistent visits , they told me that they were prepared to give me water , but at street level where it would not reach my home , which is about 150 meters away , in spite of the fact that i myself have acquired the necessary pipe , bearing in mind that the house is at the bottom of the village .
i would like to know why the utility insists on providing me with water that does not reach my house , as it should , despite the fact that i pay the subscriptions without delay ? "
* an official in the jubail water utility said that the utility had proposed to the complainant that the meter be installed at the start of the property , at the point where the water reaches it , but he had refused and requested that it be placed where it is now , whatever the quantity of water that would reach him .
he pointed out that , from the technical point of view , the water will not reach the point where the meter is presently installed , i . e . a high point in an agricultural building .
samaan al-khuri has proposed to the ministry of the interior that the blood group be added to the driving license in order to facilitate the transfer of any person involved in a traffic accident to hospital and the provision of first aid .
citizens from the area of duha aramoun , near the al-azhar mosque , have asked when the area will be equipped with telephones .
* a source in the office of the minister for telecommunications confirmed that the area is currently being equipped with telephone cables . the work will be completed within months and residents will be able to obtain telephone lines .
from amin muhammad tabbarah
" from time to time , places of worship are targeted , whether as a criminal act by explosives being thrown or as a felony , by theft of the contents , including votive offering and possessions , or by throwing them into disorder and thereby creating an atmosphere of tension in the country .
in order to prevent those who fish in these muddy waters from continuing their actions , which breach security , in particular those targeting the security of the nation and the citizens of lebanon , i propose that a special team be formed charged with protecting places of worship from any act of aggression .
from ghalib subarah :
" with reference to my previous letter , i can now tell you that the municipal council of beirut has recently begun to restore lighting in al-istiqlal and al-jazair streets and to repair the faults there .
i thank those responsible for their concern and timely action . i further hope that the officials will fulfill their remaining promises at the earliest opportunity , in particular to restore the infrastructure in the two streets ( water , sewers , pavements and surfacing ) and plan and modernize them . "
the karin a is a new scourge plucked by ariel sharon from the sea with which to continue lashing the palestinians , their authority and their president , yasir arafat , imprisoned in his ramallah cage .
unusually , however , the israeli tale of the operation to capture karin a has not been woven well .
the weapons are at once from iran and from iraq , and simultaneously for the authority and for its political opponents in hamas and jihad .
sometimes israel says that the cargo was to have been offloaded in egypt to be transported by tunnel to rafeh , and at other times it claims that the cargo was heading straight for the shores of gaza to be offloaded there . contradictory accounts that have failed to convince many , including some israelis , and annoyed the propaganda experts who specialize in the arts of deceit , spin and cinematic production .
but nor was the palestinian refutation successful , because the official announcement about the arrest of three senior officers in the authority was enough to prove the charge brought against the accused , and to rub out all the palestinians denials and attempts to wash their hands of the matter . it was also enough to know that to carry out operation such as this one required a substantial amount of cash , and everyone knows who has their hand on the purse strings in the authority and the plo .
this haste to announce the arrests at the first sign of american pressure nullified all the arguments about the capability to acquire weapons from the israelis themselves and the troubled relationship with tehran , and put the authority in the position of one found guilty of a crime that has been witnessed at first hand .
in any event , sharon did not need a palestinian confession : an american statement confirming the involvement of the palestinians would have been enough for him to proceed in what he intends to do .
and the statement came on a silver platter , made by the supposedly " rational " member of the american administration , his highness secretary of state colin powell .
the calm , balanced general did not limit himself to the demands made by the old israeli general . he even gave the israelis the green light to continue the collective punishment of the west bank and gaza as a " defensive measure " against the territories it has occupied to confront the ( occupied and angry ) palestinian " terrorism " .
what powell did not say was said by other american officials , who did not hesitate to stick the charge on the authority , iran and hizbollah collectively without any evidence , as if they were preparing to target them with a single stone in order to save time and effort in a rapidly changing , take - away world .
sharon wants this statement to complete what he began in the wake of 11 september by putting arafat up against a rock , in preparation for removing him and his authority and taking him out of the political equation in order to achieve his fundamental objective : the establishment of the state of greater israeli and thereby realize the dream of the first zionist pioneers , which was stopped by the borders of the 1948 war .
as for washington , which appears not yet to have given in to arafat 's final removal from the game , its pressure on the palestinian leader to acknowledge the involvement of members of the authority in the smuggling of weapons exempts him personally from the immediate israeli charge and temporarily keeps him away from that rock .
but it does put him in a hard place , from which there is no escape other than to comply with washington 's narrative for settlement in the region , help stifle the discordant voices rising from the palestinian question and join the choir of those chanting for the new , post - 9 / 11 world .
and between arafat 's attempts to escape from the israeli rock and his failure to comply fully with the american will , the palestinians find themselves in an arab climate very different to the reality of 1948 .
for the arabs are enjoying the anaesthetized state in which they have lived since that date and have no sense of there being any need to restore consciousness and wake up . their regimes behave as if they were responsible for 11 september , bartering and making concessions even before they are sought , negotiating both in secret and in public to put their affairs in order with the great state to avoid the evil of something they did not do , burying their heads in the sand so as not to see what is happening around them and prepared to do anything in order to wake up and find themselves on their thrones for another day .
regimes , from the regional waters of which a vessel is hijacked in what is tantamount to a closed arab lake , and yet no one dares described what happened as piracy . in fact , they accuse those behind this " attempt " of " foolishness " , " conspiracy " or of having been " foisted " on the cause .
there can be no doubt that the world is changing quickly after 11 september , and that these changes force a politician to respond with wisdom , reflection and some measure of flexibility , at least until the storm passes . but exaggerating one 's weakness only tempts the strong to pounce , to encourage those of sharon 's ilk to carry on their bloody game to the very end .
judicial overload exists in the most advanced and progressed countries , notwithstanding the particular characteristics of each country and the features of its legal system , and lebanon , in turn , also suffers from this .
the following reached us from the ministry of finance in the syrian government :
with reference to the article published in your newspaper on page 10 , saturday , 5 january 2002 , entitled " syrian inflation " by abdallah al-ahmed , and notwithstanding our respect for freedom of opinion , expression and sound dialogue , we must clarify the following :
1 . the article states , " but the minister of the economy at that time , who is our minister of finance today , has transformed syria in seven years to a giant state of solid , strategic production , " using sarcasm instead of purposeful scientific method . you should know that dr muhammad al-atrash was only minister of the economy for 1 year and 11 months and went by the title of minister of the economy and foreign trade pursuant to decree 3 ( 14 / 01 / 1980 ) . he remained in this position until 02 / 12 / 1981 , when a new ministry was formed under decree 747 ( 3 / 12 / 1981 ) , of which he was not part .
it is thus strange that mr abdallah al-ahmad cites the production figures and exchange rate of syrian lira against the american dollar , without taking the trouble to find out those who occupied the position of minister of the economy during the period in which dr abd al-rauf al-kasm occupied the position of cabinet chair .
2 . the development of gross national product in fixed prices is a more common measure of success or failure of an economic administration during a given period .
if we take the period for which dr muhammad al-atrash was minister of economy ( 1980 - 1981 ) , we find that the growth rate for gross national product in fixed prices was 11.98 % in 1980 and 9.51 % in 1981 , against 3.63 % in 1979 and 2.12 % in 1982 ( source .
1998 - 1990 ( 8 ) 24 -
of course , dr muhammad al-atrash does not attribute this high rate to himself alone : it was the combined efforts of the government , institutions and individuals , in addition to other objective circumstances .
note that the exchange rate of the syrian lira against the american dollar remained essentially stable for the years 1908 - 1981 at an average of about 5 - 5.60 syrian lira
to the american dollar . note that the increase in the price of the dollar , although small at that time , can be attributed to the increase in interest rates for the american dollar and european currencies during the first years of the 1980s , when the interest rate reached for a period of two months 20 % on 24 / 12 / 1980 on the american dollar , which encouraged investment in these foreign currencies at the expense of the national currency .
out of our belief in the freedom of opinion and expression to establish constructive dialogue , we have clarified these facts to correct the errors in mr abdallah al-ahmed 's article so that the arab reader may be aware of them and judge their content .
we ask you to look at and publish this clarification in your respected newspaper .
dear citizen ,
you must have heard that the ministry of energy intends to stop importing petrol containing lead and to replace it with petrol that is free from this environmental pollutant .
as many do not know the extent of the effect of changing petrol types on a vehicle , it may be useful to give a brief presentation on this important topic .
a review of the pages of the major oil companies on the internet ( notably that of the saudi company aramco ) makes clear the following :
- lead - free petrol provides the same level of energy and performance as that provided by petrol containing lead , but the performance of old vehicles will depend on how well they have been maintained .
- there is no need for modifications or tuning of the engine , but some vehicles may require the timing of the engine spark plugs to be modified in order to obtain better performance .
- there is no link between the use of lead - free petrol and engine problems , such as knocking or deficient burning of the petrol after ignition .
- new vehicles that are designed to run on lead - free petrol are equipped with catalytic converters and other exhaust systems . catalytic converters are anti - pollution devices in the exhaust system of vehicles that are filled with rare metals , such as rhodium and palladium . during chemical reactions they convert pollutants in the exhaust gases ( such as carbon monoxide , non - combustible hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxide ) into water , steam and nitrogen , which are more compatible with the environment .
catalytic converters can limit 95 % of emissions of compounds harmful to the environment .
the use of lead - free petrol in old vehicles has no effect , but it may be necessary for some old models to undergo minor modifications , for example to the timing of the spark plugs , to obtain a higher level of performance .
the use of lead - free petrol aims to improve the environment by limiting the emission of harmful gases from the exhausts of vehicles running on leaded petrol , which , in turn , limits the health problems linked to the use of leaded petrol .
in addition , the use of lead - free petrol extends the life of spark plugs and the exhaust system , provides better protection for the engine by increasing the time between oil - changes and limits engine corrosion .
- there is no need to change the quality or type of oil used in the motor of the vehicle following a change to lead - free petrol .
- we do not anticipate any change to the fuel consumption of the vehicle .
- we can use lead - free petrol safely in small internal combustion engines , such as motorcycle engines provided that such engines are compatibles with lead - free petrol .
- portable petrol cans and other containers used for temporary storage will not require cleaning before being filled with the new petrol .
the calm continued on the discount market in beirut for the first few days of the week , with demand for the american dollar limited to meeting the normal commercial requirements of dealers , which were met from the offers available in the currency , outside the scope of the bank of lebanon , the wider margin of intervention of which remained from 1501.00 lira ( buy ) to 1514.00 lira ( sell ) .
it was nominally closed at an average published price of 1507.50 lira , as it has been for more than 2 years and 4 months .
however , in light of developments in the movement of offers and demands , it was actually circulating in banking operations at the top end of the central bank 's margin of intervention , between 1513.50 and 1514.00 lira , for the duration of working hours in a market automatically balancing itself , the total volume of which did not exceed 6 million dollars circulated between the banks in both purchases and sales .
abroad , international discount markets operated in light of the speech given by the president of the american federal reserve , alan greenspan , last friday in san francisco , in which he expressed the view that the american economy , although sometimes appearing to have overcome its contraction phase , was not able to enter the developmental stage in any clear way , and remained susceptible to all manner of risks in the foreseeable future in view of the weakness of investments in the united states and the deterioration of the labor market in such a way as to reduce consumer spending by american families , which typically constitutes two - thirds of american gross national product .
this position has truly given a powerful shock to workers , most of who were gambling on a revival of the american economy with effect from the second quarter of this year , in contrast to the picture painted by the head of the american federal reserve , which , in the view of many , makes probably a new reduction in interest rates on union funds in the united states , despite the large reduction last year from 6.50 % to 1.75 % , which failed to lead the economy out of recession into which it fell .
however , to date , this has not provoked a wave of speculation on an increase in european currencies , the euro and sterling in particular , notably following the study published yesterday by national institute for statistics and economic studies , which indicated that industrial activity in the euro region continued its fall last month . at the same time , it was apparent that the number of unemployed in germany touched on 4 million for the same period and british industrial production fell by 0.3 % in november and 4.8 % annually .
at the same time , the dollar suffered from profit - taking operations in the currency against the yen following the positions announced last week by senior officials in the japanese government , which contained a clear warning against those speculating on the continued deterioration of the japanese currency , which has begun to threaten tokyo 's economic interests and its relations with its asian and american partners .
the green bill showed an inclination to fall , especially following the weak opening of the wall street and nasdaq exchanges yesterday , which closed in london as follows :
- 0.8940 against the euro , compared with 0.8920 last friday in new york .
- 1.4495 against sterling , compared with 1.4480 .
- 1.6560 against the swiss franc , compared with 1.6575 .
- 132.00 against the japanese yen , compared with 132.20 .
gold prices fell by a small amount on the eve of the bank of england putting up 20 tones of britain 's stores for sale by public auction today whilst the result of the operation is awaited . one ounce fell in london to 286.20 dollars , compared to 287.40 dollars last friday in new york , after it had stabilized at 286.40 dollars before noon and 286.35 dollars thereafter .
in line with this move , silver fell with one ounce closing at 4.62 dollars in london , compared to 4.6910 dollars last friday in new york , after it had settled at 4.65 dollars in the afternoon .
european stock markets moved to fall in wake of the doubts raised by the speech of head of the american federal reserve , alan greenspan , about the areas open to the economy in the united states for a recovery this year . this put stock exchanges on the other side of the atlantic in a weak position , as was the case with wall street and nasdaq .
this led to pressures on the technology , communications , banking and insurance companies sectors , whilst the flight from spanish shares continued against the backdrop of the argentinian crisis .
this led to the extra dax index at the frankfurt stock exchange closing at a loss of 144.13 points at 5065.84 points . the cac 40 index in paris lost 100.72 points to close at 4453.97 points . the financial times index in london fell 85.10 to close at 5113.50 points .

m , sun microsystems , general electric , bank of america and city group , on the other .
at the same time , pressures continued on key mart large warehouses , ford motors and dow chemical due to the suspension of the pricing of enron shares , which affected the petroleum sector .

following signature of two credit line agreements to a value of 27 million dollars , the number of agreements signed by the arab trade funding program with lebanon is 42 , the credit facility value of which is about 300 million dollars , distributed among 15 banks from among a total of 129 banks or arab agencies .
these figure were announced yesterday by the chairman of the program , dr jasim al-manai , during a line of credit signing ceremony with francebank , represented by chairman of the board , adnan al-qassar and his deputy adil al-qassar , in the presence of a number of economic notables , including vice president of the beirut chamber , robier dabbas , president of the industrialists association , jacque sarraf , president of the beirut traders , naddim asi , and secretary - general of the banking association , dr makram sadir .
in his speech , al-qassar referred to the continuing contributions of the arab trade funding program to encourage trade exchange between arab states " whether at the level of providing basic information about arab trade , or at the level of providing the funding necessary for import and export operations " . he believed that these contributions were in line with the arab moves to establish a free arab trade zone .
he announced that francebank would , under the new agreement , obtain a line of credit totaling 15 million dollars , following its obtaining lines of credit to the value of 15 million in 2000 , 10 million in 1998 and 7 million in 1997 .
he explained that the new line was moveable and unconsolidated , pointing out that the total funding obtained by the bank up to 19 / 12 / 2001 was about 57.9 dollars for 124 commercial operations between lebanon and the arab states , thereby consolidating the position of the bank as " a national agency for the arab trade funding program , just as it strengthens its role in support intra - arab trade exchange " .
he called for an increase in commercial exchange between the arab states , at a time that steps are being taken towards trade liberalization and the importance increases of international trade as the central pivot for increasing wealth in the world economy and spreading economic growth .
he believed that the permanent development of arab economic labor organization in the manner seen with the arab trade funding program constitutes the cornerstone for the process of establishing integration on firm foundations to ensure the best for the arab states .
in turn , al-manai said that the occasion reflected the extent of interest of parties in the arab world in increasing cooperation between them , which would have benefit for arab economies . he pointed out that the signing of the new line of credit agreement for francebank came in this context .
francebank is one of the first banks to deal with the funding program and has been encouraged to increase its dealings with lebanon " since we now have about 15 banks dealing with the program .
and these dealings have allowed an increase in credit facilities for lebanon 's trade with arab states and consequently with non - arab states . "
he spoke about the signing of another agreement with the lebanese - french bank to a value of 12 million dollars , which will increase volume of cooperation and facilities provided by the program to agencies and banks , in the service of the lebanese economy .
he said , " today 's ( yesterday 's ) agreement is the 42nd with lebanon . the value of facilities has reached about 300 million dollars , which reflects the movement and dynamism of lebanese banks in respect of the trade sector , which is one of the most important sectors for activating the national product . "
he expressed his satisfaction at dealing with lebanese banks , " which make repayments on time " .
he hoped to increase dealings " given that the program wishes to expand its grant to lebanese banks , in order to assist lebanon 's commercial economic movement with the arab states and support its exports and economy " .
in reply to a question about the arab states benefiting from the program , al-manai said that most countries of the region were benefiting from the contributions of the program : " five years ago , we were dealing with 18 agencies ( or banks ) and now we have 129 arab banks , which confirms the comprehensive nature of the cover and that facilities are not limited to any one country " .
he called on arab states to benefit from the volume of arab trade and the efforts being made to expand intra - arab exports .
he said that most arab states had adopted economic reform programs , which focused on liberalization of trade , bearing in mind that most had signed up to international trade agreements or european partnership agreements , such as lebanon , which confirmed the importance of the trade sector and the desire to deal with markets in order to benefit from opportunities in foreign markets .
he announced that the volume of facilities granted to arab states was about two billion dollars " which is an important figure given the modest volume of intra - arab trade " .
he pointed out that the arab trade funding program had begun with capital of 500 million dollars , which had now risen to about 700 million , " bearing in mind that we are keen to distribute profits to shareholders regularly " .
in turn , al-qassar said that the program provided funds for the banks according to specific conditions , with the risks at the responsibility of the bank " which must scrutinize the quality of the borrower and the risks associated with his position , and then formulate the margins in terms of the scale of the operation , its precision and the situation of the borrower " .
he pointed out that the loans were made to the economic sectors , including trade , industry and agriculture .
following two weeks of improvement , ready liquidity in the lira fell by 10 billion from the week between 28 december and 3 january as a result of a fall in the volume of money in circulation and a reduction in deposits on demand .
however , savings deposits in the lira rose by 51 billion following last week 's fall , paralleling a renewed fall of 13 million dollars in foreign currency deposits .
paid - up treasury bonds for the non - banking sector continued to fall , which amounted to 3 billion lira .
the directorate of statistics and economic research at the bank of lebanon reported that the cash block had developed in this period as follows :
1 . ready liquidity in lira ( 1 ) recorded a fall of 10 billion , as a result of a fall in the volume of money in circulation by 8 billion and a reduction in deposits on demand by 2 billion lira .
2 . savings deposits in lira ( 2 - 1 ) rose during this week , by 51 billion lira .
development of cash block in lira ( 2 ) remained low at 13.52 % .
3 . deposits in foreign currency ( 3 - 2 ) fell by 13 million dollars , thereby making the annual development of the cash block ( 3 ) 6.07 % .
4 . development of the cash block in its wider sense ( 4 ) over the year reached 4.38 % .
paid - up treasury bonds for the non - banking sector fell by 3 billion lira over the week .
discount market : the discount price of the american dollar in the beirut market stabilized this week at 1507.5 lira .
the following table shows development of the cash block :
1 = cash in circulation + deposits on demand .
2 = 1 + other deposits in lira .
3 = 2 + foreign currency deposits .
4 = 3 + public bonds outside the banking sector
cash rule = cash outside bank of lebanon + current banking deposits with bank of lebanon + term banking deposits with the bank of lebanon .
director general of the arab labor organization dr ibrahim quwaider believed that " arab states must provide between 3 and 4 million job opportunities annually until 2010 " . he noted , " there are countries such as egypt , which must provide 619,000 job opportunities annually to prevent unemployment rates increasing in the arab world . "
on the problems of unemployment in egypt , he said , " it stands at the head of arab countries in terms of the size of the labor force , which totals 23,817,000 and increases at an annual rate of 3.6 % .
egypt is thus required to make available 1.6 billion dollars annually to resolve its chronic unemployment problems given that the cost of one job opportunity is 50,000 pounds . "
he added , " the egyptian government has approved 8 programs to provide 1 million new job opportunities . these 8 projects include the employment of 150,000 young people in the administrative apparatus of state , providing 300,000 job opportunities in non - government sectors , creating 150,000 positions as part of the export support program , giving loans to 300,000 young people and craftsmen to implement small projects , employing 50,000 people abroad and 50,000 young people for village and district development . "
on unemployment in the gulf states , quwaider explained , " unemployment in these countries has its own unique nature in view of the presence of 8.1 million foreign workers , and so local nationals form only 28 % of the general labor force . " he added , " unemployment in the states of the gulf cooperation council is 17.8 % , which has driven these states to expand the localization of positions policies , replace migrant workers with local nationals , establish strict restrictions on the entry of foreign workers , impose large fees on work and residence permits , provide more facilities to expand the implementation of nationalization polices , establish special funds to support employment of young people and improve the information available about the labor markets . "
to escape the arab unemployment crisis , the director - general of the labor organization called " for urgent closer ties and cooperation , for the arab states to have the opportunity to build a strong economic market and to direct capital to the states and locations within these countries where labor is available , and not the reverse ; and for the urgent development of human involvement in the formulation of development strategy , to work to increase production , raise quality levels in work , and for arab government to make the required move towards flexibility and use of modern technology in manufacturing and administration , in order to develop and progress arab labor markets and improve their capacity to absorb new entrants . "
president of the republic emil lahud yesterday met with the chairman of the board of the kuwait fund for arab economic development , sheikh badr al-humaidi , accompanied by the kuwaiti ambassador , ali sulaiman al-said , the fund 's representative in lebanon , bassam al-uthman , chairman of the board of development and construction , jamal aitani , and chairman of the board and chief executive of the al-laitain water utility , eng . nasir nasrallah .
the visit took place on the occasion of the signing of an agreement to fund the second part of the first stage of the southern irrigation project , the cost of which is 217 million dollars , of which the fund is contributing 65 million dollars .
lebanon previously signed a loan to the value of 100 million dollars with the arab fund for economic and social development , thereby making the total cost of the first stage of the project 165 million dollars funded by the two funds , with the state funding 2 million dollars .
lahud was acquainted with the work of the kuwait fund for arab economic development and the projects that it funds but which are executed by government departments under the supervision of the development and construction council by al-humaidi .
he praised the support provided by the kuwaiti fund to lebanon to assist it in its progress towards economic recovery under the direct guidance of the amir of kuwait , sheikh jabir al-ahmed al-sabah and senior kuwaiti officials . he believed that the position of kuwait in continuing to provide support for lebanon " underlines the depth of relations between the two sister countries and reflects a common will to develop and consolidate these relations in all areas " .
the president of the republic expressed his delight at the recovery of the amir of kuwait following the health indisposition he suffered some time ago and at his safe return today to the country .
al-humaidi and the delegation then visited speaker of the chamber of deputies nabih birri at his office in ain al-tina , following which he gave this statement :
" i had the honor of meeting speaker nabih birri . the aim of the visit was to inform his excellency about the work of the kuwait fund .
at the beginning of the meeting his excellency inquired about the health of his highness the amir of kuwait and i reassured him that he would return tomorrow ( today ) , god willing , following his recovery .
his excellency expressed to me his greetings to and wishes for the health and well - being of his highness . "
he added , " i informed his excellency that a new loan to fund a project for which the lebanese have waited for a long time , the al-laitani river project , would be signed tomorrow ( today ) . this is the project that we discussed during the visit of his excellency the speaker to kuwait last year and during my meeting with him some months ago .
and as we promised , the agreement , under which the kuwait fund will provide a loan of 20 million dinars to fund the project , in addition to other contributions from the arab fund , will be signed .
in signing this agreement we hope to begin implementation before the end of this year .
i informed his excellency of what had happened in respect of the use of kuwait 's grant for the reconstruction of the south following its liberation and , thanks to god , i am delighted to say that the fund 's grant was fully used to rebuild 850 homes liberated from israeli aggression . "
speaker birri said , " today , the day on which the amir of kuwait returns to his home , his family and his people , he extends the hand of assistance to a project which our old men and grandparents dreamt about before our young people and children , namely commencement of the al-laitani project , which is to take place this year . the first loan will be signed tomorrow ( today ) . the project is a national humanitarian offering from kuwait and an integral part of kuwait 's numerous contributions to combat the israeli occupation , because israeli always used the pretext of water wasted in the sea to justify its invasion of lebanon .
we note that the first operation under which it attacked lebanon in 1978 was called operation al-laitani .
in this climate we welcome brother badr al-humaidi and once more thank kuwait , its amir , its council , its government and its people , in the name of lebanon and in the name of every southerner . "

but her role was exposed , she was arrested and made her confession to the public appeals advocate in the south antwan farahat , in which she revealed that she had worked for 7 years in the clinic of dr jamal h .
she had decided to kill his wife in order to marry him .
two months ago she stole the keys to the dentist 's home from his clinic and made a copy of the house key . on 10 / 01 / 2002 , whilst the dentist and his family were away from home , she went there , stole the jewelry of his wife laila . she then set fire to the house and sold the jewelry in the market to husain ali gh .
, age 32 , and hassan ibrahim l .
, age 28 .
she was not content to stop there , but determined to continue her devilish plan by killing her employer 's wife .
to carry out her plan , after having learnt that laila al-jardali was not at home , she asked the dentist to excuse her whilst she went home to change her clothes , which were covered in oil . he agreed and , carrying a stick and a knife , she hired a car to the dentist 's home in al-hilaliyyah . she entered the house and waited for laila 's return . on her return she savagely attacked her and hit her repeatedly with the stick . she then tore her dress and stole three of her gold rings , one of which was inlaid with precious diamond stones . she then stabbed her with the knife as the victim begged for mercy and compassion , stabbing her six times . she then left the house after locking it with the key and threw away the knife , the stick and the keys in the public road .
she then went home and hid the rings , changed her clothes and coldly returned to the clinic . at the same time , laila was transferred to hamud hospital in sidon where she received the necessary first aid and received a medical report for a period of one month .
after the public attorney , antwan farahat , has listened to the victim , she told him that the person who had attempted to kill her was rima salih saad , who worked in her husband 's clinic . she was arrested , quickly broke down and gave an interesting confession . she revealed that she had decided to kill her , burn the house and steal the gold in the first instance and that she had sold the gold to husain gh .
and hassan l .

all the stolen items were recovered .
after hearing dr jamal and both husain ali gh .
and hassan ibrahim l .
they left their residence documents and rima was remanded to trial on the charge of attempting to kill her employer 's wife , set fire to the house and steal the jewelry . the crime confirms to provision 549 of the punishments law and the death penalty is prescribed .
, aged 24 and ahmad mahmoud m .
, aged 21 . in the investigation conducted with them , the former confessed to stealing 12 vehicles on earlier dates from al-hamra , burj hammud , ras al-nabaa , al-tariq al-jadidah , furn al-shabbak and al-sanai . all the vehicles were seized in the areas of ras al-nabaa , al-tariq al-jadidah , al-jamaah al-arabiyyah and they include 8 hondas , a pontiac , a toyota and a mazda .
the second individual assisted the first in stealing vehicle cassette players and other effects inside the vehicle . both sold the effects and divided the money between them .
they also took hashish .
the two detained were referred to the relevant court .
it is thus requested that citizens who fell victim to their acts come to the headquarters of the al-dahiyyah detachment at al-awzai , al-naqib al-shahid mustafa ali hasan building , or contact 01 / 850843 or the emergency number 112 , to give what information they have in preparation for the necessary legal steps to be taken . "
the public relations department of the internal security forces have distributed the following announcement : " the directorate general of the internal security forces , pursuant to the instruction of the public appeal prosecutor in the south , jamil bairam , have made public the photograph of muhammad ali s .
, aged 40 , was detained by the sidon judicial detachment in the legal police unit , on account of his conducting numerous armed burglaries , sometimes using a blue renault 12 with blacked - out windows or a yellow van .
the directorate general therefore requests that citizens who fell victim to his acts attend the sidon judicial detachment or contact the following two numbers , 07 / 725830 or 07 / 724990 , or the emergency number 112 , in order that the necessary legal steps may be taken . "
public prosecutor for cassation adnan adum has approved the request of the former political advisor to the leader of the " lebanese forces " , tawfiq al-hindi , to attend the funeral rights of his mother , yuland razzuq al-hindi , to be held this afternoon in the syrian catholic church of sayyidat al-bisharah in mahalit al-mathaf .
al-hindi will be transported from his place of detention in the rumiyyah prison directly to the sayyidat al-bisharah church for a period of two hours , accompanied by members of the internal security forces , in order to take part in the burial and final viewing of his mother , who died last friday following a chronic illness .
adum , to whom the request made by advocate joseph naamah on behalf of his client , al-hindi , was referred on the basis of his jurisdiction , said that he had agreed to the request made by the former official in the " forces " to attend the prayers for his mother 's soul " on condition that he made no media comment or statements , that others must respect the occasion and must not chant slogans , in order to preserve appearances and prevent unrest .
we have given instructions to the internal security forces in this respect . "
in response to a question , he said , " we intended to agree to him going to the house before the church but it became apparent that his mother 's body was at the mortuary of the otil dio hospital . "
on the reason for his rejecting the request made by the editor of al-hayat , detained colleague habib yunis on an earlier and similar occasion , he said , " the investigation with yunis had not yet finished and the charge sheet in his file had not yet been issued " .
in response to another question , he said , " al-hindi 's lawyer wrote moving words in his request and that the mother of the latter had repeated her son 's name whilst breathing her last . "
it is noted that the permanent military court will commence al-hindi 's trial in the case in which he is detained with the media figure antwan basil in a sitting on the 13th of next february .
the public prosecutor for appeals adnan adum ordered the detention of 24 bengalis on board a ferry , who are to be prevented from leaving until an investigation into a case concerning suspicions of foreigners being transported illegally is complete .
it is understood that the investigation include the captain of the vessel , a syrian who part owns the ship , and a lebanese maritime agent , who obtained permission for the bengali detainees from the general security department to bring them into lebanon for 48 hours , provided that they leave lebanese waters at the end of that period , after they have traveled from their country on the vessel on which they are now detained .
local interpol telegraphed their greek counterpart to find out whether the vessel 's captain had previous involvement in the smuggling of foreigners by sea
and whether he had previous charges brought against him in greece , whether he was responsible for transporting them to the port in greece , or whether he did not transport them there after receiving information that there were two groups to be transported from bangladesh before the group detained .
information in the possession of the judiciary suggest that there were operations to smuggle foreigners at sea between lebanon and syria after they had been transported from their country by sea , with some to be left on the shores of france and others transported to germany .
it is noted that a german security delegation had visited adum before
minister of education abd al-rahim murad opened a training workshop for teachers from government secondary schools participating in the school net and schools on line project , which is a model experiment undertaken by the ministry between a number of government schools to establish contact between teachers and pupils and to assist these secondary schools to develop the teaching methods of their teachers by encouraging them to conduct scientific research and create an educational reference that will help pupils demonstrate their talents over the internet .
in his speech , murad said , " schools should not be disrupted tomorrow ( today ) by the strike of teachers contracted with the government secondary and primary education . " he confirmed that the law on permanent appointments was before the chamber of deputies .
he added , " when we draw up the draft permanent appointments laws and it comes before the chamber of deputies , they strike once more .
unlicensed contractors and others have demands . i looked into this matter when i was minister of vocational education in 1995 and i approved a proposal in this regard to give permanent appointments to those contracted in vocational education , which i followed up in the education committee .
i saw how much discussion this law took up in the administration committee and financial and offset committee with regard to the small , precise detail .
the matter is currently in the hands of the chamber of deputies and the specialist committees . for this reason , the schools should not be disrupted again , when they have already been disrupted in the mountains because of the snow and ice . you know the importance of the number of days of study , especially for classes studying for official examinations . "
he hope that those contracted would primarily concentrate on the permanent appointments law , which would take its time in the chamber of deputies until the civil service council set a date for the permanent appointments examinations .
he said , " we cannot continue with this novelty of contractual relations . nor can we ask contractors to work when they have not received their dues in 18 months . "
he confirmed " the preparations to overcome the administrative routine in the ministry " . he said , " we suffer from a shortfall in material capabilities and the painful reality of school buildings , and we must develop the laws to overcome administrative routine .
we will strive to secure larger resources because human resources are the most important investment . "
he added , " the implementation workshop for school buildings , the corner - stone of which we have already laid , starts next march . we will meet with the chairman of the development council soon to this end . we will have about 150 new schools in all areas . "
the new director - general of education , george naamah , spoke saying , " i do not claim that i have come to perform miracles , but to cooperate with everyone in order to reduce the problems , not inflate them . this will take time .
i do not believe in working on one 's own . my firm belief is that no matter how physically or mentally endowed a person is , he cannot build alone . proper construction requires collective activity .
an institutions rests on both their junior and senior members . "
" a discussion about lebanon 's hotels cannot take a conventional form , as that of any history book .
everything told about them is a combination of truth and history , the nostalgia of those who lived those days and albums of half - torn yellow photographs , and the dreams of those who have read , heard and written with the quill of memories they possess , but have not lived them .
on reviewing the histories of european , american and oriental hotels , without neglecting the lebanese , it becomes apparent that each hotel has a story . . . and every hotel has a thousand and one tales covering politics , commercial deals , velvet parties and long nights that would fill the books of memoirs and history . "
" lebanon 's hotels : history , nostalgia and future " is the second title , following on from " lebanese industry : history and civilization " , published by capt. joseph al-raidi in volumes by which he seeks to inform about " the long history of the economy and tourism in lebanon and the extent of its worth , experience and excellence , which allow it to meet the challenges of the future " .
this is the second book publication of which is sponsored and financed by the sana insurance company .
the publisher prefaces his book with a quote saying that the hotel industry and the philosophy of hosting gave birth to each other .
" what we know today of the high and civilized standards of this industry is a natural development in which sociology , customer psychology , architecture and the natural beauty of time and place are combined .
but important historical stages have changed much in this industry and put it in front of new demands towards constant development . ..".
under the title " the past " , the originator of the book , edgar jallad , returns to the time of mary , when she gave birth to the baby jesus and was searching for an inn or place to say .
the idea developed to places of refuge and reception , and from there to hotels as they are known today .
the writer divides the book into four sections , each containing a collection of titles embellished by old black and white picture and other bright new color pictures of lebanon 's new hotels or those renovated with their spacious halls and magnificent rooms .
the first section , back to roots , returns to the time of phoenicians and their accommodation and travels , continuing through the religious tourism seen by lebanon in the first centuries ad when pilgrims traveled to the holy places , notably in palestine , passing through lebanon , syria , iraq and other countries .
this need for places to stay continued with the islamic conquests when the map changed and the number of pilgrims fell . these centers were used for travelers moving from the arabian peninsula to southern europe and vice versa .
under ottoman control , the khan was born , which comprised a building usually of two floors .
the book shows the frank 's khan in sidon .
the second section of the book , " a trip through memories " , focuses on beirut and the splendor and lights in al-burj square before moving to the regions : the mountain : heart of lebanon and the reminiscences associated with it ; the beqaa : romance of the plain ; the north : happy nights ; and the dreamy south .
in the third section , " the lights go out and the dancer sleeps " , he presents the last night before the outbreak of the lebanese war on the eve of 13 april 1975 , when beirut performed its final dance in the nights of time .
the lights went out , the candles were lit and the tears continued for about 25 years . ..
the nation 's children were tested , the conspiracy won and hotels paid the price of the war of lebanon 's enemies . "
the book calls 1974 " the year of the summit and the fall " , and then begins to discuss the dusting off and the return of the dancer to light the nights of the east .
the publishers dedicates the fourth section to hotels that have made a difference to the lebanese tourism industry , such as : san joseph , a thousand nights and stories ; al-bustan , the dream of a night in the thirties ; phoenicia , the pearl of the coast , lebanese marriott , the albergo , where history is a guest , berntania , mountain palace , riviera where the sun does not sleep ; bristol , the elegant ; bay view , the heart of the city .
they depict the presenter as irritating , terrifying and murderous , perhaps more suitable for scaring little children than presenting a competitive program like this . and so everyone criticizes her and most chat programs on our channels present her as bogeywoman working to insult people , abuse the participants , forgetting that every game has its own rules .
perhaps some like the weakest link so much that they have exaggerated their praise for it , talk of its success and the manner in which it is presented , which those responsible for it have tried to make comparable to the similar original , which the lebanese have been able to watch over the satellite , even to the extent of matching the haircut and spectacles of the presenter .
and perhaps some hate the program so much that one person said that his ulcer hurt him every time he watched it and that he quarreled with his children , asking them to change the channel so that he could relax .
but between these two groups of people let us pause as colleagues to observe the detail of what happens via the screen in front of the eyes of the program 's presenter in terms of how man treats his fellow human being when it comes down to winning or losing .
there is courageous voting , when the strong work hard gradually to eliminate the weak from their way from the beginning of the game , so that the end of the program is a struggle between the strong . it as is we are stood before the united states and the soviet union in the days of the cold war , and some countries have become pawns , which the rules of the game allow to be eliminated during the struggle .
during the voting it is clear how the bigger players are able to push the smaller ones to adopt their way of voting , so that they burn each other up and leave only the bigger players at the end of the game , when the clock stops and the struggle comes to have no limits for them . this embodies the capitalist mentality of competitiveness where only the strong , and not just the good , survive . strength does not require that one stand on the side of truth , but with the strength , on the basis of the saying that " truth is power " .
the two strong players hurry to fill the bank with profits , thereby persuading the smaller ones to burn each other up , just as the big states fund the wars of the small .
there is also cowardly voting , when weaker players seek to eliminate the strongest player whenever one appears , thereby leaving only the weak in the center . the bank does not fill with cash , which is supposed to be won , nor are there successive rounds for a qualitative accumulation of successes . in fact , every person who succeeds becomes a target for everyone else in the competition .
in this way , the weakest eventually wins but with the smallest profit , which is the way of the fox in inciting the lion to attack the wild beasts of the forest in order to be able to eat some of the prey 's flesh when the lion has finished eating .
this is similar to the situation of some developing countries , which strive to win a point here and a point there at the expense of the larger countries , which allows these countries to win some points in order that they be kept busy with one another and it remains on top of the struggle .
this is the situation of the strong player who has withdrawn from the game in spite of the fact that he is the strongest link . he leaves strong before the viewers whilst the winning strongest link triumphs but , in the eyes of the viewers , he is the weakest in practical terms , which is why he deserves to be described in terms of " cowardly voting " , because he is a member of the party of successful enemies , the largest party in the arab world generally , and in lebanon in particular .
we note that in the program everyone tries to link the chain . everyone wants to add to the profit store in the bank by saying " bank " whenever they get a question right . everyone wants to give the right answer and believes that in eliminating others , they maintain spirit of the team or the chain .
this resembles the readiness of some countries to accept one of their number being struck by the hand of larger countries thinking that it is preserving itself , when , in fact it will end up eating nothing , as happened with iraq when it invaded kuwait and with kuwait when iraq was hit .
in this respect the weakest link is an exemplary program in expressing the reality of life in the world , and no one has the right to object to the attack to which one of the players is subject when they make a mistake , since there is no room for mistakes in a game which is supposed to be played by adults , i . e . those with more knowledge and technology . otherwise , they will end up like afghanistan , when it decided to confront the united states .
the weakest link shows some of the values prevailing in this new world . the age of globalization in which we live cruelly throws the facts before our eyes , and when we reject them , it means that we remain closely tied to our old world .
but when we sink into acceptance and participation , this means that we have fused with this new world and the standards of its globalization . but in both cases the presenter of the program reminds us every second that we watch it that we are living under the banner of globalization and must learn to take a stance on what is happening , which , in many cases , is to reject it as a result of our place in the world under globalization . but its nothing personal !
the national union of private associations contracted with the ministry of social affairs has organized a protest movement at the failure to pay their salaries and financial dues for the months of november and december .
members of the national union of private associations began their protest by assembling outside the ministry of social affairs bearing banners demanding payment of their salaries . a delegation from among them then met minister asad diab . president of the union tawfiq asiran spoke on their behalf , saying , " the problem of the private associations is not with the ministry , nor is the demonstration directed against the ministry , because the ministry today is a victim just like we are .
we have decided to move via the ministry and by coordinating with it . our move today is to defend the rights of the ministry and to secure the rights of employees , associations and workers .
we thus understand the efforts being made by the ministry . our move is not directed against any measure taken , but to find out from the minister and the director general the steps that indicate that the ministry will reclaim its rights . "
he added , " the problem of the private associations is this : 79 % of the ministry of social affairs ' allocations have been withheld and how can this ministry , which it was said would solve or help solve social and economic problems , work when 79 billion lira is today being withheld from it . why this ministry ?
is it because it is the ministry of the poor , those on low income , the disabled , people with difficult social circumstances and orphans ?
we want the various official and religious authorities to support us in our move . "
minister diab said , " today you are expressing your right and the pressurized situations and we , as a government , are responsible at the level of the ministry of finance and the ministry of social affairs .
we hope to cover as soon as possible the urgent portion despite the difficult financial circumstances . but our aim and concern is to alleviate people's problems so that we , and not the people , bear them .
we are convinced of your demands and your case is a serious one . i hope that your concerns will be lifted because the private associations bore the social concerns during the war and , without them , we would not have reached this level of social work .
these associations , which deal with a large group of people , should not have to feel the pinch . i single out for thanks the union , which has been concerned with education and joint action . you should be rewarded , not suffer . "
diab then asked that a committee from the associations follow up this matter with the ministry .
the delegation from the private associations then proceeded to the ministry of finance where they met minister fuad al-sinyurah , who promised to look into their demands .
the higher monitoring committee for government primary education announced yesterday in a press conference convened at the syndicate of editors that it will hold a protest demonstration at 11:30 am today outside al-saraya al-kabira in protest at the failure to meet the demands of teachers .
it demanded payment of all the sums due from the last academic year and a retrospective increase to the hourly rate for the years following the decision to increase wages and provision of all social securities , including health and payment of a transport allowance .
colleague antwan shidyaq , representing the syndicate of editors , spoke at the conference . he said that education in lebanon was in need of patronage because it concerned the lebanon of tomorrow and future generations .
he added , " the press can only stand beside those who are striving for the lebanon of tomorrow . "
rakkan faqih then read a statement from the higher committee , which said , " our living and professional conditions , as contracted teachers , has deteriorated to such an extent that it can no longer be tolerated under any circumstances , no matter what the pretexts and justifications put forward by the government , which refuses to remedy this social and educational issue in a fair manner , after the collapse has gone beyond the inability to secure the transport allowance which allows us to reach the schools which we ensure operate in remote rural areas and congested areas of the capital and major cities , thereby rendering our lives an unbroken chain of worries and problems arising from the worst conditions of contract , including the failure to pay the sums due for the last academic year , bearing in mind that the hourly rate we are paid has not exceeded 6,000 lira in the last eight years .
at the same time , all staff and teachers in the private and public sector have had more than one increase to their salaries over this long period . we have been excluded from this for no proper reason , not to mention our having been deprived of all the social securities , including health and the travel allowance .
remember that the hourly contract rate at the secondary stage of education is 24,000 lebanese lira ; the rate for the primary stage is just 6,000 lebanese lira , which clearly demonstrates the extent of the injustice and deprivation . "
the statement added , " therefore , pursuant to the above , the higher monitoring committee calls on all contracted teachers at government primary stage to take part in a strike and protest demonstration before the al-saraya al-kabir building in beirut at 11:30 am tomorrow ( today ) to declare further , escalating steps , before moving to continue the protest in front of the council of deputies building until the following demands are met :
- all sums due for the last academic year shall be paid in one payment without delay .
- payments for the present academic year shall be secured and paid monthly .
- the hourly rate shall be retrospectively increased for the years following the decision to increase the salaries of all government employees and teachers .
- all social securities shall be provided , including health security .
- a transport allowance shall be given , as is the case for all employees and teachers .
the draft law of appointment for contracted teachers has been placed on the agenda for the meetings of the relevant deputy committees for approval following amendments , guaranteeing all contracted licensed and unlicensed teachers the opportunity to sit the entry exam for public position .
- the number of years of experience and university qualifications shall be taken into account . "

tense relations continued between the administration of sayyidat al-luizah university and pupils who went on strike yesterday in protest at expulsion decisions and warnings addressed to a number of them .
meetings continued from the morning , some headed by the university chancellor father butrus tarbih and attended by the deans and the head of student affairs . the families of the expelled students attended a meeting to which they were invited in the morning .
what was the result of the meetings , which continued until 9 pm ?
head of student affairs , dr shahin ghaith refused to make any statement and referred all contacts with the media to the public relations and media office , run by suhail matar , who , in turn , refused to discuss the meetings and refused to deal with the issue in the media , " because it is a simple matter and not worth it " .
he thought it sufficient to say , " the issues were moving towards a resolution " .
a number of students stood at the entrance to the university and prevented their few colleagues from entering the campus .
they informed them of the decision taken by the " student government " to suspend lessons .
the expelled students attended the university along with the academic and administrative staff who worked normally .
a statement was issued in the morning by the director of academic affairs dr george eid , which stated that yesterday was a normal working and teaching day .
but there were groups of students who returned home or went skiing who did not read its contents .
the students distributed two statements ; the first addressed the academic staff , accusing one of them of sowing discord .
the statement said :
" in view of the current circumstances and conditions , and the events witnessed by sayyidat al-luizah university , we want to provide you with a clear and frank picture of what is really happening on the ground .
we wish to inform you that our non - attendance at classes today does not mean that we are against the university , but we hope that the knowledge we acquire in a civilized university will be to our credit and , at the same time , make you proud , thereby making us as one hand , lecturers and students cooperating to remove anyone trying to sow discord between the university and the students . "
in the second statement , which was addressed to the students , the student government covered some problems , saying , " either we have freedom within ourselves or it will not exist , liberating and not restricting us .
the slave in authority cannot hear the voice of one calling for truth and freedom .
this freedom makes us concerned with the interest of the students . we are fed up with deceit , hypocrisy , exploitation and standing before the student affairs office receiving its response of ' no ' , yesterday , today and tomorrow .
our demands remain suspended on files in the hands of people who believe that the university is made of up columns and doors that they build and drag as they wish .
people who work to put an end to us because we took part in the bread of true independence and rejected the bread of false independence among the columns of the university , and because we want a solution to the problem of the new finance law , bearing in mind that the suspension of the strike on monday was conditional on implementation of these promises and a solution to the bus problem . the response , as if to put pressure on the students , was to pay a subscription allowance for the car park .
the administration rewarded us by expelling some and sending warnings to other and by putting the problem in the media .
in spite of everything we remain committed to our promise : we will do what we deem appropriate for the interests of the students of the university and not for the interests of its columns and buildings .
for as we move further away from defense of our rights , we come close to need and fear , and our situation will get worse as long as we remain silent , choose to accept instead of reject and to wait instead of to act .
our work today is to justify to the university our rejection of its unfair policy and that we , as students , will be one hand in confronting all the means of pressure imposed upon us . the closing of classes today ( yesterday ) is no more than an expression of our rejection of the status quo but without us closing the door to dialogue . "
the on - going meetings may come to a solution , the seeds of which will be seen today with the return of students to the classrooms .
if the problem has grown and come to be of broad concern , it is not limited to the expulsion of 4 students for one week and the warning of 4 others , given that it may the administration 's right to take such a measure if there has been a breach of internal regulations . the real problem is the breaking off of dialogue with the young generations in institutions that have made upbringing , and not education , their aim .
the seeds of a solution appeared at 10 pm , but it is better that they arrive late than fail to come at all .

cairo - wsf - the egyptian authorities yesterday destroyed a wall surrounding the home which was to have been the residence of the new israeli ambassador in cairo , jidaun bin ami , in the suburb of al-maadi .
a security source said that the objective in destroying the wall was to widen the road and deploy additional security units .
bin ami arrived in cairo in october and this month submitted his papers for approval to the egyptian president , husni mubarak , but he had not yet moved into his residence , which is different to that used by his predecessor zafi mazil .
a representative of the israeli embassy in cairo confirmed that there was a dispute but did not clarify the reasons for the objection of the new ambassador to these works .

they were directly linked to the report prepared by the special committee formed by the board of directors to uncover the reasons for the largest bankruptcy in american history .
the report did not blame the two vice presidents but their place in the group hierarchy and their positions put them at the heart of the scandal , alongside former finance president andrew fastow , who established a money - smuggling network with a secret and suspicious link to enron .
causey and buy refused last week to speak before the senate trade , sciences and transport committee , maintaining their constitutional right to silence .
meanwhile , watkins said that she had tried to seek an explanation from her bosses for the complex partnerships in which the company had become involved but had not received convincing answers .
she said that she met lay on 22 august , and that he had promised to consider seriously her fears about the company 's collapse , but he had deemed it sufficient to charge a firm of lawyers to investigate her complaint .
she had asked him again on 30 october to declare the company 's financial losses .
chairman of the committee , jim greenwood , said that watkins had warned lay and other officials of the " significant tampering with enron 's financial statements , the recording of falsified entries and the covering up of actual losses " .

he responded to another question , by saying , " yes .
i kidnapped him by my own will . . . i have no wish to defend myself .
i did it .
whether i was right or wrong , i had my reasons .
i do not believe that pakistan should be allowed to become a contractor for the interests of the united states . "

where is his body ? "

tehran has confirmed that it received information from the united states about members of the fundamentalist al-qaeda organization led by osama bin ladin fleeing from afghanistan to iran , but it described this information as " old , incorrect and inaccurate " .
the iranian islamic republic new agency ( irna ) reported that the special american representative to afghanistan zilmai khalil zadeh had told the bbc that washington had provided evidence to iranian diplomats during multi - party talks held in afghanistan .
it quoted the spokesman for the iranian foreign minister hamid rida asfi , who is accompanying minister kamal kharazi on his visit to bangladesh , as saying that " this information is old , incorrect and inaccurate " .
the iranian government has previously denied repeatedly that it provide a safe haven for taliban or al-qaeda fighters . it said that it had detained a number of them whilst they attempted to flee across the common iranian - afghan border , which is a mountainous area .
asfi said , " iran has made many efforts to combat terrorism " and will submit " soon a full report on the matter to the secretary - general of the united nations " , kofi anan .
the iranian jumhuriyati islami newspaper quoted sources in the iranian parliament as saying that islamabad had expelled cadres suspected of belonging to al-qaeda and said , " the pakistanis have closed their borders with afghanistan and expelled al-qaeda members to iran " .
it explained , " following the closure of quranic schools in pakistan , pakistani students of islamic jurisprudence have illegally entered iran to continue their studies . to date 280 have been detained . "
iranian radio broadcast that the authorities has recently detained in the south - east of iran 150 foreigners , most of whom were arabs , some of whom held french , british , belgium and dutch passports .
based on officials in the iranian security agencies , it said that these foreigners were from arab and african countries and had entered iran illegally from pakistani territory after covering about 750 km and that among their number were holders of french , british , dutch or belgium passports , intimating that these foreigners may have links to al-qaeda .
he announced , " we have informed the relevant embassies of the illegal entry of these persons , some of whom are accompanied by their families and children . "
* in islamabad ghirat bahir , spokesman for hizb - i islami , which is led by qalb al-din hikmatyar , stated that the latter was prepared to leave iran , where he lives in exile , if this would help improve relations between iran and the united states .
this statement was made two days after the iranian authorities closed the offices of hizb - e islami in iran in an attempt to limit american criticisms of tehran on account of washington attributing to it attempts to rock the stability of the transitional afghan government lead by hamid qarzai .
hikmatyar opposes the presence of foreign forces , including american forces , in afghanistan , which have followed the flight of al-qaeda and the taliban movement .
bahir said , " we have informed our iranian friends that their problems with the americans cannot be dealt with by closing the offices of hizb - e islami or by expelling hikmatyar . . . the americans have misgivings with iran , which range between nuclear installations and support for the palestinians and hizbollah , and the americans want to impose a regime of their choosing on iran . "
he pointed out that hikmatyar had been planning to return to afghanistan last year , but he changed his mind for " specific " reasons .

paris - by george sasin :
israeli foreign minister shimon perez confirmed yesterday , " the immediate declaration of a palestinian state will get us past the impasse " . he affirmed that he had failed to persuade the american administration of his point of view .
french newspaper le monde yesterday published the key excerpts from the " non - paper " drawn up by perez and the chairman of palestinian legislative council , ahmad qurei ( abu ala ) .
in an interview published with le monde , perez said , " the palestinians must be given political horizons or they will have no reason to make a move . "
he added , " to get out of the present situation , there must first be a ceasefire and to date the palestinians have sufficient motives to undertake to honor it .
then international support must be secured , but we see a difference between the united states and the european union .
there must also be political dialogue , but there is none at present . "
he noted that the recommendations of the international fact finding committee , chaired by former american senator george mitchell , and the document produced by the director of the central intelligence agency ( cia ) , george tenet , represented the " prevailing mentality " of the united states on the palestinian - israeli conflict , but " whilst these documents provide a train line , the engine and the carriage , the problem is that that does not take us anywhere " .
he opposes the french idea , which called for elections in the areas under the palestinian authority " because they would be in the interests of extremism " .
we inferred this in 1996 .
the israeli press will cover this matter .
for public opinion does not need this at the present time . "
the excerpts published by the newspaper from the " non - paper " formulated by qurei and perez one month ago said , " the oslo agreements did not give the palestinians the independence which both sides wanted . "
it convinced the palestinians that they are subservient and come under the state of israel , as was the case in the past .
the attempt to put an immediate end to the struggle failed .
and it showed the condition of giving up on dreams was impossible . "
" two sensitive topics - jerusalem and the refugees - were put forward at the heart of the talks when people were not yet ready for this .
for this reason a path has been prepared to reach the final solution and will be implemented gradually , according to stages determined previously (...).
( the proposals ) have not been prepared to take the place of the mitchell report and the tenet document , but to provide a framework in which they can be implemented .. . the present situation requires a fundamental change . . . immediate recognition of palestinian state can lead to talks between equals on the borders of the final solution .
a palestinian state may give greater responsibility to the palestinian leaders , who would no longer be able to say that they have no authority .
this would also force them to establish institutions of government with all that they entail , such as distribution of responsibilities and determination of different ministerial duties .
( the proposals ) comprise the following stages . . . return to stability and establishment of a ceasefire , allowing progress on the political front .
the ceasefire would be implemented with the participation of the united states .. . this stage includes measures designed to build trust between the two parties , including a persistent fight against terrorism .
the mutual acknowledgement between the state of israel and the state of palestine would temporarily be based on the areas currently subject to full or partial palestinian control .
in the future , final borders would be put in place and determined on the basic of security council resolutions 242 and 338 .
talks on the final solution would begin in the eighth week following a ceasefire and conclude within a year .
they would deal with matters relating to the borders , refugees , jerusalem , settlements , security , water and relations with other countries . .. . implementation of the agreement would take one year with effect from ( the date of ) signature . "
prime minister al-hariri is entering the harshest of battles on the economy , which no one else before him has tried to do out of fear of defeat . in entering this battle it is the solidarity of those in power that will guarantee victory .
the fact is that to deal with the dire economic , financial and living conditions requires difficult decisions , some of which will harm large sections of the people , whilst others will affect large merchants and owners of monopoly agencies , which causes the voices of protest to increase .
an increase to customs duty , for example , will keep one group happy , whilst a reduction will do the same for another .
value - added tax puts greater burden than they can bear on lower classes and those on low income , and so they unite to reject it . but bear in mind that this tax is a necessary evil , as the former deputy prime minister michel al-murr said .
for without it , and without other painful economic measures , the lower classes and those on low income will face a bigger loss when the economic and financial conditions worsen and lead to a reduction in the purchasing power of the national currency .
a review of the status of monopoly agencies undoubtedly provokes the anger of those who have benefited from them for 60 years , given that these agencies are limited to a small group of major merchants and importers , who represent economic and financial figures and prominent persons and who form one of the centers of power in the country , a center that is hard to touch .
but , according to those with experience , and before any decision was taken on this matter , the abolishment of monopolies required that a widespread media campaign be organized , one which would explain the reasons for a review of the status of monopoly agencies . this would have reassured their owners of the step being taken by the government in this area and the protection of their rights . it would also have ensured the positive response of all sections of the people because it will lead to a reduction of prices by opening the door to competition . in addition , it will be in harmony with the international trend , with the laws of international trade and the european partnership agreement , which requires entry into a stage in which laws are updated and developed in accordance with international legislation . it will further restore lebanon 's role as an arab - asian marketing center after economic and political changes in lebanon and the region have prevented it from continuing that role .
in this regard al-hariri says that he is not looking to see who will benefit and who will be harmed by the economic and financial measures the government is taking ; rather , he is looking above all to the interest of the country by defining a role or function for it in light of the changes that are taking place and are expected to take place , by transforming it into a shopping center able to compete , with the merchant no longer thinking about big profits from small sales , but from small profits from big sales .
when the lebanese market offers good products at a reasonable price , lebanon will then be able to compete with all markets . it would be wrong and stupid to suggest that this has a sectarian tint to it .
the disturbances that are preceding the results of the implementation of value - added tax and the review of monopoly agencies are thus disturbances with political background or a background of self - interest .
the logic of dealing with the government and its measures requires that we wait to see what these measures will produce in order to pass judgment for or against them . if the results are in the interests of citizens , why should there be any need to mount unjustified strikes , demonstrations or marches ?
those who oppose or criticize the government 's measures should not prejudge them and view them as ineffective : they must wait a few months and , should they be proven to be ineffective , they can then call the government to account . and should they prove to be effective then it will be they who are to blame and in the wrong .
the government that is responsible for dealing with the economic and financial conditions must take the measures it deems appropriate and effective and bear the results , whether they be good or bad . one cannot obstruct the taking of such measures and then blame it for their failure to deal with the economic and financial conditions , especially when there remains a series of painful measures still to be taken in the service of the nation and the citizens , and to save the economy .
some of these measures concern maritime estates , the excess in government departments , a review of the status of the chamber of deputies , the supreme aid authority and other organizations and councils that can be dropped in order to relieve the pressure on the treasury and reduce spending . this is to stop the waste of public money as far as is possible in all its different forms , including the continuing corruption in some departments and organizations .
to continue sound preparation for the important leap to rectify the financial situation , by means of the process of privatization , with the aim of reducing the public debt , in readiness for the convening of the paris 2 conference , with the government having completed most of what is required in order to obtain at this conference the aid and loans that will allow lebanon to escape from its economic and financial crisis . this requires that the leaders cooperate in taking the necessary economic measures and set aside political differences to avoid any shocks from them , even until the date set for the arab summit in beirut and the paris 2 conference . this is what makes president lahud stress to some of his visitors , " the unity of lebanon 's stance appears today to be more necessary than at any other time in light of the challenges facing lebanon , especially the economic challenge , which requires cooperation between the state and the citizens . the priority in the current circumstances is to focus on the daily needs of the people . "
away from the debate and discussion , the question in which the people are interested is this : will the measures taken by the government and those that the government has yet to take deal with the economic , financial and living conditions and will the liberalization of the economy whilst preserving its freedom reduce prices and combat inflation ?
it appears that the coming few months , and not predicting the results , will give an answer to this question on the ground . and then the government will either be revered or blamed .
emil khuri
arafat has been in the fiery swamp of the ramallah siege for weeks , but his patience is waning thin and he wants to get out .
it is astonishing that , instead of building bridges to safe shores , he is bent on blowing them all up without guaranteeing that there will be any way of return , as they say . and thus discussion of fateh 's decision to abolish its two military wings , the al-aqsa martyrs brigade and the al-awda brigade , is no more than a desperate attempt to conform to american - israeli bluntness , albeit at sword point or beneath that sword .
it is not clear to what extent arafat can respond to the unending series of crippling and harsh demands . but it seems that he must press on and give 100 % to end the violence , even to the extent of hanging himself at his own hands .
we do not know how a decision could be taken to stop the intifada in installments when the israeli forces continue their open massacres of palestinians ! there can be no doubt that the discussion at the meetings of the " revolutionary command council of the palestinian liberation organization - fateh " , which ended with the decision to stop the two military wings , coincided with the israeli tracked vehicles setting out on their series of portable invasions . but the question that can be asked on the margins of this decision is this : what meaning can this council or the movement have after such a decision ?
of course , there is no need to answer .
but you would have to be very superficial to believe the " statement of obedience " which , it was initially said , had been issued by the al-aqsa battalions , after the revolutionary council had issued its decision following discussions which arafat had personally led over a two - day period , since subsequent statements rejected that very decision .
the rejection is both natural and expected because the decision cannot be implemented in the present context of aggression : it not only asks the people to put an end to their anger as they die in the face of the invasion machinery , but to drown in delight and joy as they do so !
in any case , arafat knows full well that even if he were serious about stopping the two military wings of fateh , neither israel nor america would believe him because when fateh tries to gobble up the new generation , which is trying to correct the process of delusions that began in oslo and has continued up to the ramallah siege , that means the seasons of defeat and disaster will continue . and so an examination into the fate of intifada activists , such as marwan al-barghuti , hakam balawi , uthman abu gharbiyyah and ahmad ghunim , is no more than a frail attempt to say that arafat is on the way to giving 100 % effort to end the violence !
even were the above decisions merely a contrived exercise , can we begin to imagine the emotions of palestinian and arab public opinion no more than 48 hours later when the hear news of an armed incursion into the gaza strip resulting in six palestinian dead and dozens wounded ?
once more there is no need to answer . but there is another perplexing question that suggested itself yesterday : what is arafat gaining from the statements he made to the italian la republica newspaper , in which he said that the hamas movement was the willing tool of the israelis ?
would sharon then release his captive and negotiate with him once more ?
and would america then sense that the limits of the 100 % efforts against terrorism had been reached ?
of course not .
arafat has revealed that ishaq rabin once said to him in front of king hussein , " we acknowledge that the establishment of hamas was a major error on our part . " but if hamas is israel 's prodigy , israel will not accept that this fact come to light and nor will hamas ever accept the charge .
we do not know what arafat gains by saying that " hamas ' missiles are a primitive joke and not to be feared in the slightest " because this will irritate israel , which tries to give the impression that that the al-qassam 2 ' tubes ' are intercontinental missiles . it will also irritate hamas , who have been accused on not being able to scare a cat . and , ultimately , washington will not change the daily reminder to give a 100 % effort to stop terrorism .
even if he were to hang himself he would not reach " the blessing " of this impossible figure .
haartz yesterday revealed a document never before published , an unofficial paper prepared by the miguel anjel moratinos , special european union representative to the middle east following talks in taba in january 2001 between the israelis and the palestinian . the document records the points agreed between the parties and those that remained a matter of dispute .
despite the fact that this document lacked any official status , it received the approval of both parties .
among the most important points on which agreement was reached was israel 's recognition that the borders of 4 june 1967 would constitute the basis for the borders between it and the palestinian state .
it also accepted the evacuation of jewish settlements in the jordan plain and the gaza strip , provided that it would incorporate the major settlement blocks , which contain 80 % of settlers .
the two parties agreed to the principle of exchanging land provided that israeli and palestinian territory remained geographically continuous .
the gaza strip would most probably be under full palestinian control .
on the matter of refugees , the israeli party unofficially agreed to a gradual return over 15 years on three tracts .
the first concerned return to israel , for which no numbers were agreed , but the unofficial paper speaks of 25,000 in the first three years of implementation of the plan , and a figure of 40,000 refugees annually for the first five years was mentioned verbally .
the second concerned the absorption of refugees from areas that israel would hand over to the palestinians as part of the exchange of territory . the third related to the absorption of refugees as part of a framework to reunite families .
the two parties agreed to give priority to refugees returning from lebanon .
on jerusalem , the two parties agreed to the plan of president bill clinton , which proposed that arab areas of the city come under palestinian sovereignty and that jewish areas come under jewish sovereignty .
it also agreed to make jerusalem an open city .
the israeli side agreed that the city should be the capital of two states : urshaleem , the capital of israel , and al-quds as capital of palestine .
but differences were apparent on control of the al-haikal mountains , the tunnel under the wailing wall and the land surrounding the maaliya adumim settlement and ghafaat zaifi .
haartz correspondent zaif shif commented on the document , diminishing its importance .
he quoted advisor to ehud barak and the director of his office at that time , jalaad shir , as saying that the document was just " scribble " .
notwithstanding this , shif acknowledged that it comprised an accurate compilation of the stances of the two parties on various topics .
he concluded , " in taba the palestinian met with a moderate israeli delegation , of which delegation members yusi sarid said that it was perhaps the first time the palestinians had met a similar israeli delegation .
today the palestinians want to return to the opportunity now lost .
and there are serious doubts about whether the lessons of the present intifada will allow the governments of israel to adopt these same positions . "

written by ruzana bumunsif :
successive developments in the wake of approval of the draft general budget for 2002 by the chamber of deputies have released a range of very negative indicators , with the spat between the government and economic organizations over the abolishment of commercial monopoly agencies and liberalization of medicine imports forming only a small part .
in the absence of a clear plan and mechanism which the state can follow , the government , by means of the steps it has taken in order to absorb the rancor over the value - added tax , has translated them in a haphazard and ill - conceived way , thereby overthrowing in reality the desired positive effects , if , indeed , there were any positive effects , on the basis of a terrorizing verbal attack launched in all directions , instead of reassuring us .
on the one hand , there has been no shortage of evidence of a political spat and a complete lack of agreement between the leaders , which the economic organizations tried to effect in order to put the brakes on the government 's drive towards abolishment of monopoly agencies in light of the provisional neutrality and patience attributed to the president of the republic on this matter and a desire for a deeper and more comprehensive study .
this impression is only broken by the words quoted by the speaker of the chamber of deputies following his meeting with president emil lahud about the agreement of the three leaders on this matter . the president of the republic was forced to declare openly his agreement before the meeting of the council of ministers in view of the political and sectarian nature of the step the government intends to take . otherwise , his impartial stance would lead to the overthrow of the government , had he gone further in maintaining the distance that he wanted between him and the government on the economic front , not to mention the advice he received in this regard .
some confirm that the media campaigns against the prime minister would not have gone as far as they did unless they wanted to exploit the distance drawn by the president of the republic .
but the overthrow of the government is not desirable as was apparent from the meeting to approve the draft budget , bearing in mind that there was an initial move on the part of deputies , and there were slogans which many rallied behind , on the basis that this was an option . in fact , matters went much further than this when the speaker of the chamber of deputies headed a meeting of the leaders of the blocs in order to organize the sessions for the debate but with the aim of taking control of matters in bringing the government to account .
this meeting discussed the possibility of giving the opportunity to a limited number of deputies to express themselves on behalf of their bloc or otherwise , bearing in mind that delegating deputies to speak on behalf of their colleagues is unconstitutional and has previously led to crises , the least of which was when delegation was given on formation of the government at the beginning of president lahud 's term when prime minister al-hariri rejected the principle of delegation .
this recent political development , when understood in these terms , reflects a confusion as to how to manage affairs irrespective of the principle of organizing sessions , which , may , be required in reality , albeit without prejudicing constitutional and democratic principles , given that events themselves may breach them , as was the case in the budget vote .
in parallel , the government has been obstructed in carrying out what it had intended to be a moral step before being a practical one , irrespective of whether these steps were innocent or otherwise , for ultimately the abolishment of protection for monopoly agencies , as in the case of liberalization of medicine imports , may have a positive effect .
but one cannot discount the possibility that the government hopes that this creates conflict and interference in the private sector , by which it may be able to implement more taxes for at least another year , during which time some things may become clear and it may have scored a few points for consumers .
but until it reaps what it has kept secret , whatever it does will be a problem because no one understands where it wants to go in the absence of any , at least moral , guarantees offered in return .
no less dangerous than all these indicators - the continuing , implicit political conflict between the leaders despite their denials , the absence of a comprehensive government program to make clear the scale of the assistance required from citizens without stubbornness , nor indeed the concealment and covering up of the facts - is the failure of the bank of lebanon to publish a payments budget , in view of the large deficit recorded in the first 9 months of the last year , before it could be rectified by the governor of the bank .
according to specialist observers , this indicates one of two things : either there is a new policy on information technology or the payments budget has some negative aspects and the bank of lebanon does not wish to publish negative information , given that this would imply a difficulty in covering the commercial debt and the consequences this would have for the principle of transparency of information , given that much of the information at the present time is damaging and harmful and , as such , there is no need for it .
whilst this measure is important , it should not be interpreted so much as scare mongering at the situation as a message to those concerned that the matter has gone beyond being just empty words . in practical terms , it should be interpreted in terms of the central bank playing wisely with the cards it still has in its hands as part of the " engineering " of the state finances that it is carrying out , extending lebanon 's ability to withstand . it has introduced a range of steps : the imposition on banks of the 15 % compulsory reserve on foreign currency was not the first ; the last was the request made to banks to take stocks in scattered debts at the banks in liras , as it wished to establish a liquidity with which it could work .
all these indicators , which are linked to the remarks made by the deputies about the government and its policy in approving the budget , make it difficult for positive reassuring factors to prevail , no matter what efforts or attempts are made .
storms like these do no harm from time to time .
at very least we should remember that lebanon is not just a country of different sects ; it remains , in fact , largely a nation of merchants . neither the wars for positions and appointments , nor political in fighting , has undone the concept of class interest .
of course , matters are always complicated in lebanon where the arbitrariness of the ruling class must also corrupt the " perfection " of the class contradiction , not to mention the hidden intentions that quickly become semi - public in the name of " sectarianisation " . then everyone seeks the forgiveness of god at this metamorphosis as if it had just entered the life of the nation but without anyone daring to refute the sectarian dimension to which a modest reference was made .
but , despite these complexities , the contest that flared up surprisingly quickly over the draft abolishment of monopoly agencies succeeded in confirming that reading marxist political economic literature was not a waste of time for anyone who did so in lebanon .
perhaps this speed , with which the media / advertising campaign against the proposal was characterized , was in itself evidence of the importance of the commercial clique in the economic structure of the country .
for it is not just the haste of the government alone that explains the speed of the movement against it . laws used to be passed virtually by stealth without us witnessing one quarter of the mobilization observed by readers and viewers in less than a week , even when these laws touched upon the bases of the nation 's society and included laws for successive elections .
nor can the fury of the campaign be explained by some of the visual media , which is usually compelled to ruminate on the higher national interest on behalf of their exclusive agents , the lords of censorship and political security , finally finding an opportunity to express the oppression they feel .
for the percentage of journalistic effort here too is low when compared to the " norm " of repeating the press dictation , albeit from different sources . or even assuming that this is how it is , we cannot forget the possibility of there being a disjunction between an economic , class - based dictation on the one hand , and a political - security one on the other .
for when the government trips up , all knives are useful .
and the fact is that the government tripped up without being helped by anyone . its move was defective in many respects , most prominently in the failure to coordinate its message , which made it appear like a chameleon " changing its colors as it changes victims " , as the former ambassador simon karam said , especially given that the process of acclimatization with the dictates of international trade provided by the european - mediterranean partnership or world trade organization , does not require such haste .
but none of that should diminish the significance of the context against the government 's proposal .
in a country that both loves money and is embarrassed by it at the same time , that continues to shrink from the material accounts that are at the heart of its existence , the emergence of class interest into the public domain constitutes an invitation to review some of the conclusions that were thought to be final following the war .
the most important review is that which should extend to the firm power of the old classes and their ability to deal with changes to the political surface .
but economic policy can never be abbreviated to in simplified terms of social class , as some would like .
for the issue is not a battle between those who have monopolies and the deprived .
for citation of the " old classes " is of no benefit unless it leads to observation of the " new classes " who , in turn , are striving to have their share of the cheese platter .
bearing in mind that the enthusiasm of the leader of the amal movement and the chamber of deputies may help us to understand the scale of this demand , albeit that it may also muddle the debate and cast it in sectarian terms .
but what is of greater importance is that political economics is supposed to take into account the wider context of trade , namely the regional context .
in this sense , a class - based analysis will only be correct if it also includes the " old " and " new " classes in lebanon , but also the classes in control and those trying to gain control in countries that belong to the same geographical and economic area , but enjoying one " major benefit " : they are not governed by laws as much as they are governed by customs and , sometimes , by the scales of pure power .
this means , in as much as it means anything , that the merging of arab economies in an international trade movement free from restrictions will have a negative impact on most unless the measures striving towards openness ( towards the outside world ) are completed by opening arab markets to each other .
this should push the lebanese government to work to drive forward the proposed greater arab trade area during the beirut summit .
and if this project will , in turn , provoke contests enriched by local class - based accounts , it may , in return , help to bring these accounts in line with the national economic interest .
or let us at least say that it may prevent the trade area from becoming a dedicated arena of secret wars , similar to the police stories in circulation in lebanon and syria , or indeed the arabian peninsula , by virtue of the integration of interests , or the lack thereof , between the laws .
samir qasir
former deputy habib sadiq welcomed the plan to abolish monopoly agencies but he questioned " the competence of the government authorities , in both their visible and invisible wings , to bring about this required move " .
he also asked , " why has the authority not tamed its appetite for plundering public money nor corrected its lost sense of direction ? "
yesterday sadiq stated the following :
" there is a clamor in the country which two parties , who lack the balancing confidence of the vast majority of the people , are trying to kindle from above .
but this does not , and should not , prevent clear and firm positions being adopted on the principal issue , the subject of this furious clamor .
in principle , there is nothing to justify the monopoly dispute in any of its present forms .
in general terms , monopolies are an offence against the whole system of human values .
and so people generally , with the exception of those who pursue their own private interest , stand firmly opposed to any form of monopoly , from a monopoly of power in all its different forms to a monopoly over a grain of salt .
here the lebanese , with the exception of those with an individual or group interest , join to welcome the lifting of every official order concerning monopoly agencies , in particular those that have a monopoly on the things which people cannot live without , such as food , medicine , clothing , educational items and housing .
but , as they welcome this official move , which has been needed for many decades , all lebanese are asking about the competence of this ruling authority , in both its visible and invisible wings , to bring about this required move , in exercise of a correct process that will bring benefit to citizens generally and not just to this group or that , which benefit from the protection of one or more wings of the government .
then the lebanese ask whether the new official approach is really part of some new , comprehensive method of government adopted by the authority for the benefit of all the lebanese people , which is how things should be if lebanon were a state of law , institutions and independent national decisions .
why has this promised state unfortunately not yet materialized in lebanon and why , consequently , does this method have no practical effect , for if it did why would the social - economic situation in lebanon be crashing into the abyss at an ever increasing speed ?
does the request for a tax on added value imply a change of method has taken place in the tools of government , one that aims for the good of the country and its servants , or is it a measure that will increase the severity of the present crisis and add to the misery of the wretched , who form the vast majority of the people ?
and if we repeat , once more , our support in principle for every measure designed to limit every form of monopoly in the service of the people 's interest , we also ask why the authority , in both its visible and invisible wings , has not tried to tame its appetite for plundering public money and rectify its lost sense of direction in the economic - financial and social administration , so as to slow the speed of the present collapse ?
there can thus be no way out of the neck of the bottle unless the forces of the democratic opposition in all their forms unite on a common position , from which they can rectify the present government imbalance on all levels and by employing all the means provided by the provisions of the constitution and called for by the principles of democracy . "
the defense , interior and municipal councils committee has unanimously approved the draft law for a security agreement between lebanon and armenia , but has postponed a decision of the draft law relating to organization of civil aviation in order to examine some of the observations made by deputies .
after the meeting , chairman of the committee deputy sami al-khatib said , " the committee had postponed a decision on the second draft because the minister of defense 's signature was not on it .
it was returned to the committee following signature by the minister of defense and the ministers of justice and finance .
there was no reason for it to be returned .
we therefore discussed the draft at length without going into the details of the articles .
we found that two of our colleagues had made valuable observations on the draft and we postponed completing the study of the draft until a meeting next thursday after the deputies have seen these observations , so that the debate would be more effective and beneficial . "
he clarified that the observations concerned the national guard and the civil aviation security authority and other observations , and " we recalled the draft submitted by the ministry of the interior , which required the establishment of an organization for aviation security , to be called the air police , which exists in developed countries . the task of this police would be to monitor vehicles entering and leaving the airport . "
the education , higher education and culture committee continued to study the appointment of secondary school teachers taking into account the academic examination , personal interview , experience and the number of years in service along with working hours . we will continue the discussion in a meeting to be held on tuesday .
the chairwoman of the deputies committee , bahiyah al-hariri , stated , " this is the third meeting that we have allocated for this project , which requires more detailed examination in order to ascertain the real need for secondary teachers , to secure schools ' requirements and thereby decide on the excess teachers . we have begun to draw up plans for the coming stage , to distribute teachers among schools according to requirements without resorting to contracts by opening the faculty of education in the manner specified by the ministry .
more than one thousand teachers are known to retire annually .
instead of plugging the gaps by contract , we intent to formulate a strategy for the next five years incorporating the needs of schools . "
she noted , " the committee has received another draft from the government concerning the lebanese university , examination of which will commence next week . "
in response to a question about the amendments made to the draft relating to secondary teachers , she said , " we incorporate precise amendments in order to maintain the level of teachers , specialization and competence , which make them suitable as secondary teachers . we also take into account social and educational circumstances . "
she clarified , " this initiative is restricted to secondary teachers and we give priority to education , which will form the basis of selection . "
she noted , " the number is as determined by the minister of education and higher education , in the range of 2600 teachers . we are endeavoring to obtain from the ministry of education some information , figures and the specializations in each district . "
she said , " those to be offered permanent government appointments will remain in their position in the regions , according to requirements . the teachers know that we are serious about ending the matter within this period and that we are not acting under pressure . our only concern is the interests of pupils and education . this will be the least year of contracts . permanent appointments will be phased according to the requirements of the faculty of education . treating this matter in all its aspects will reflect in stability for all teachers . "
she added , " the transfer of teachers from one school to another can no longer take place in the traditional way , as was prevalent . it now requires a causal decree issued by the council of ministers and on condition that transfers take place before the start of the academic year . "
the national economy , trade , industry and planning committee announced its support for the government shift to lift protection from commercial agency monopolies as it " was in the interest of the consumer and lightens the economic burden " .
the committee focused on the need to maintain product quality and standards , in particular in relation to medicines .
chairman of the committee deputy ilyas sakkaf announced that the committee was in the process of preparing for a seminar on the economic situation and how to deal with it .
former norwegian prime minister and director general of the world health organization
the united nations commission for environment and development has for 15 years adopted a pioneering approach by putting people at the heart of the development process .
today , the commission , comprising 18 international specialists in the economic and health sphere , including two nobel prize winners and former finance ministers , has endeavored to submit a report which is tantamount to a new international plan to eradicate the gap between rich and poor and to encourage development in developing countries .
the report , which is titled " macroeconomics and health : investing in health for economic development and progress " , stressed the urgent need to put people at the heart of the matter .
in other words , it views investment in human resources as a pressing need and central factor in development with the aim of breaking the poverty trap in developing countries .
it also constitutes a fundamental factor in economic progress and social development and a key condition for increasing productivity and creating fairer and more effective societies .
our world is determined to combat those who would sow terror and death among us .
but we must be more determined to improve living conditions for hundreds of millions of poor who do not obtain a fair share of the world 's wealth and opportunities .
and we must do this not just because it helps to create a safe world for everyone but because it is the right thing to do .
poverty robs hope , sows despair and gives birth to frustration .
strengthening health is a key part of the solution .
health directly contributes to human security .
at the same time , by focusing on international and local facts , it helps to erase the poverty gap .
millions die each year and millions of others suffer from easily preventable or treatable diseases because they , or the country in which they live , suffer from degrading poverty
the commission 's report shows how little effort we must make and how great the rewards if we can ensure the establishment of an effective basic health system in all countries .
basic health services can be provided for 34 american dollars per person per annum .
but this figure is three quarters the amount allocated by poor countries today , estimated at 11 american dollars per person per annum .
if we add these sums , we find that they show we must spend an additional 66 billion american dollars on health each year until 2015 .
developing countries must secure half of this sum from their own budgets , with the other half to come from the increasing development aid given by industrial countries .
namely , an amount equivalent to one cent for every 10 dollars of the gross national product of the wealthy countries of the world .
the profits would be massive . members of the commission estimate that 8 million people would be saved each year and annual economic profits would reach 360 million american dollars , i . e . a sixfold return on the original investment .
can developing countries absorb this huge sum of money and use it in an effective manner ?
this is what dr sash and his colleagues on the commission , who include dr manmohan singh , former finance minister in india , and former deputy prime minister of thailand , supachai panitchpakdi , believe .
the key to lasting work and effective results certainly lies in health becoming a priority at the highest levels of political leadership .
for the political leaders will take action when they see their people demanding it and when they see a new inclination emerging .
over the last two years we have seen increasing political commitment to health in all areas of the world .
nevertheless , it is only the beginning and we can all help maintain this momentum .
the commission recommends establishing macroeconomics and health commissions in each country , the task of which will be to determine the tangible steps necessary to support the health system and organize the known and effective methods of protection against the principal diseases of poverty .
the world health organization will work with these countries as they follow up the recommendations of this report .
the analysis and results of the report will be included in national , regional and international events .
countries will be encouraged to implement their decisions by modeling the work of the commission through existing forums or by establishing national economy and health commissions .
the countries of the world have no interest in ignoring an opportunity like this to carry out effective work for the benefit of future generations and to preserve the health of the peoples and the earth .

with the harmful waste management project comes to an end next march , the ministry of the environment has issued the following statement :
" the ministry of the environment , as part of its working policy , endeavors to formulate the plans necessary for the preservation of the environment and to combat pollution , whatever its source , to draw up legislation and propose specifications to guarantee the quality of the environment and ways of dealing with environmental dangers arising from urban spread in all its forms .
on this basis , and under funding from the world bank mediterranean technical environment assistance program , a project was begun in march 2001 to manage harmful waste . the project is implemented by an italian consultancy company with the support of a consultancy committee drawn from the development and construction council , the ministry of trade , the ministry of public health , the ministry of energy and water , the lebanese industrialists association and a number of representatives from three different industrial sectors .
the aims of the project may be summarized as follows :
1 . estimate the volume and quality of harmful waste produced in lebanon .
2 . prepare the necessary legislation for how this waste is to be managed .
3 . prepare a comprehensive national plan for the management of this waste and how to dispose of it in a sound environmental manner .
4 . set up activities , prepare materials to educate relevant persons , and hold educational events in the regions about the dangers of this waste and how to dispose of it .
at the end of this project the ministry of the environment has prepared new legislation to manage harmful waste in lebanon , including : draft decree on categorization of hazardous industrial waste ; draft decree on management of harmful industrial waste including ways of storing , transporting , treating and final disposal of hazardous waste , and all the requirements for the management process thereof ; draft decree for management of waste produced by health organizations and how to dispose thereof ; and draft decree to license and issue permits to organizations disposing of harmful industrial waste . "
the statement added , " both at the level of awareness and guidance , the working team will establish dialogue with relevant ministry officials on determining the harm caused by such waste , sound environmental ways of disposing of it and the tools provided in these decrees for this purpose .
it will also organize discussion groups in all lebanon 's governorates on harmful waste and ways of managing it , ways to implement the relevant legislation , to include officials from the governorates , municipal council , private environmental organizations and industrial complexes .
special leaflets and a guide to managing harmful waste in the proper manner will be distributed . "
* a source at the ministry of tourism said that the director general nada al-sarduk is conducting an investigation into the complaint .
a resident of kafr hura village in the district of zaghrata has complained of the failure to repair the electricity network in the village , despite this having been done in all areas . the village requires a second electricity transformer .
he said that the people have approached the qadisha electricity company , but to no avail .
* " the distributor " previously tried to follow up the complaint directed against the lebanon electricity organization but was unsuccessful in locating a single official who could deal with it .
further to the complaint of salum aazar concerning the attack on his property , number 964 , in al-ashrafiyyah , and the inflow of water from the car wash , which was published by " distributor 19 " as having been referred to the buildings department in the beirut municipality for the necessary action to be taken , the director of the buildings department isam tannir has notified us of the following :
" following the inspection conducted by the municipality department of property numbers 964 and 3768 in al-ashrafiyyah , and following an examination pursuant to the documents , it became apparent that the settlement of the subject of the dispute between the owners of the aforementioned properties was the responsibility of the relevant authority . "
we have previously sent two letters of clarification to mr. salum aazar , owner of property number 964 , al-ashrafiyyah , on 22 / 08 / 2001 and 02 / 10 / 2001 respectively .
with regard to the complaint relating to the inflow of water to property 964 , the cleaning department in the beirut municipality has sent warnings to those washing the cars and thereby causing the water to flow into the aforementioned property . they have complied and removed the damage .
a female citizen says that she has been taking a medicine ( its name ) , which involves 4 pills each month , i . e . 1 per week , but that the nation social security fund have refused to pay the costs of the said medicine , on the grounds that it only recognizes the small containers of this type , which contain 30 tablets . she asks whether this is reasonable .
* a source in the national social security fund confirmed that the fund only pays the cost of medicines registered with the ministry of health .
residents of a the jadidah al-matan are complaining about a supermarket that does not subscribe to the lebanese electricity organization and which has three electricity generators working 24 hours each day . none of them meet the public safety conditions .
they added , " we are permanently choking on the oily smoke rising into the air , which causes breathing difficulties and other illnesses .
and we cannot open any windows or external openings or the black smoke and residue comes into our homes .
we submitted a complaint several years ago and the response was that the generators comply with the required specifications .
this is the voice of children , young people and the elderly screaming , asking those concerned to come and inspect the place , even once , to see the reality of the situation .
* would the complainants please specify the address in detail so that they can be helped with the relevant authorities ? the al-jadidah area is very large ; it is not just one street .
we are certain that the sharia law was not made for adults , but for sinners and reprobates , for the immoral and sinful , for those deem permissible and perpetrate those things that have been prohibited , for those who kill their mothers and fathers , for murderers and adulterers (...) for liars and those who break their word , for all those who break the sound teaching . "
is the age over , despite the fact that the historical distance separating us from its end is two and a half years ?
and did deputy walid junbulat mean when he said a few days ago that " we must all protect ourselves behind the maronite patriarch " that the man would be a refuge for the liberated and the opposition to the end of his era , especially following the attack on the minister of health sulaiman faranjiyyah by those he called " the security dogs " by means of rumors circulated about him and his wife being the subject of a murder attempt by members of his own family and that his wife was wounded by a bullet and had been transferred to a hospital in a serious condition ?
and if what the former advisor to the leader of the lebanese forces , dr tawfiq al-hindi , said at the military court the day before yesterday is correct , namely that the confession he had previously given , which led to him being accused of having dealings with israel , were extracted from him by force and that he had been forced to lie and deceive to save himself from torture and physical and psychological pressures brought to bear on him following his detention last august ,
then the picture painted by minister faranjiyyah does not give much cause for optimism , especially after he noted that president lahud tries to avoid talking about political matters and , instead , prefers to talks about swimming and diving , and to say that policy was undertaken by " others " outside the government and constitutional institutions .
the syrian detainees are entering their fifth month of detention at the ministry of the interior adra prison close to damascus . with the exception of deputy mamuun al-humusi and deputy riyadh saif , whom the regime believes to be an internal case and subject to special rules and provisions that do not apply to the other detainees , none have been charged .
this is despite the fact that the period of detention has been an extended one for the state of truth and law with which citizens were promised . the fate of messrs riyadh al-turk , aarif dalilah , habib isa , habib salih , walid al-nabi , hasan saadun , fawaz tallu and kamal al-labwani remains obscure , notwithstanding the rumors which sometimes say that they have not yet been brought before the courts because they will be brought to trial as free men , at other times , that they will be given a special pardon by the presidency , or , alternatively , that they will be brought before a normal , not a special , court and that this will take place as soon as the trial of deputies al-humusi and saif takes places , etc .
and so the days pass without the detainees being treated according to syrian law and its provisions , without their family and friends knowing their fate , although some are ill , and may indeed be very ill , such as riyadh al-turk , who is paralyzed in his hands and has bloated legs and feet which are symptoms of the distention of his heart , which requires permanent medical attention that the medical specialists doubt the prison authorities can provide ; or the like of habib salih , who suffers from all manner of physical and psychological problems .
this matter of the ten colleagues poses a fundamental question : why were they detained ?
the question should be put to the authorities first because their detention has implications that go beyond the people involved , implications for the choices and opportunities open to the government and the country . the alternatives to them , which the detainees , each in their own way , have succeeded in posing and in bringing out their true form , bear appropriate answers to the equation put before syria :
in an article entitled " an examination of the causes for terrorism or taking pride in terrorism " published in the al-nahar issues on the 7th of this february , abd al-razzaq eid referred to an article of mine published in the al-quds al-arabi newspaper on the 11th of last january , which dealt with the statement made by syrian president bashar al-asad on terrorism during his meeting with a delegation from the american congress .
eid appears to be certain that i have rushed to interpret the expression attributed to president al-asad , and says , " it would have been better for hadidi 's reading for him to have waited and checked the sources for the evidence and the veracity of those sources . "
the expression to which he refers , and which he markets in the heart of his article , is this : " syria has experience in combating terrorism , from which the united states can benefit " .
the fact is that i am not sure that eid has read this article of mine because i did not quote this expression , by which i mean to say that i did not cite it at all , in any way ! what i said was , to the letter , as follows : " some days ago the syrian president received a delegation from the american senate . the discussion dealt with reactions to 11 september and the importance of settling on definitions to define the concept and identity of terrorism and the concept of extremism in its different forms , and ways of combating terrorism .
the syrian media quoted al-asad as announcing to the delegation that the us could benefit from the experiments of states that had combated terrorism , notably syria . "
my sources were ( in addition to the arab press and the news agencies , which i have no reason to accuse of deliberately and willfully distorting al-asad 's words ) the syrian arab news agency ( sana ) , which i doubt is as reliable - at least in the official documentary sense - as " a baathist friend allowed , to some extent , to know matters from the inside " , whom eid questioned about the veracity of the expression . the baathist friend responded that " he had only heard it in the press comment , but had not seen it in official sources " and consequently " expressed his surprise " .
the other side to this censure from eid goes as follows : " brother hadidi 's basis for his interpretation of the expression attributed to the president is that logic requires that the syrian authorities and the president 's young administration take care to bury this infelicitous reference . .. it should avoid speaking of it , try to erase its trace and turn the page . .. and there is an interest in forgetting it or feigning forgetfulness .
the logic that hadidi seeks from the syrian authorities he himself forsakes , thereby forgetting what he asked of others , if , that is , the attribution of the expression to the president is accurate . he does this when from a different opposition stance he recalls these disasters and tragedies and presents them to pick the wound once more ! "
thus , there is firstly an expression that i did not quote , but which eid censures me for hurrying to attribute to al-asad , and for citing and interpreting it .
and , secondly , i wrote the article in al-quds al-arabi not to commemorate the 20th anniversary ( notwithstanding the fact that i believe this anniversary to be a fundamental break in the duty of commemorating recent and contemporary syria memory , which is wholly at odd with the " picking the wound " story ) , but as a central part of the comment on the statements of the syrian president in relation to terrorism , and to make clear the disastrous political , security , economic and social aspects of the " syrian experiments " in combating terrorism .
eid failed to spot the major moral difference between an authority that once caused a massacre and the simple " logic " - tactically as strategically - requiring this authority to bury the memory of the massacre , if possible , and the right of citizens and victims , not to mention the duty to remember , not to close this black page other than as part of a comprehensive and effective national reconciliation ( which eid acknowledges has not yet happened ; in fact , the most prominent and genuine supporter of this reconciliation , riyadh al-turk , has been locked up ) after accounts have been settled and people called to account for their actions .
in this context , i will allow myself to quote the last paragraph of my article : " the 20th anniversary of the hamah massacre deserved consideration from another perspective and some form of call for national reconciliation and closure ( so that we do not talk about any insinuation of self - criticism ) and not add insult to the deep wound , from which dark blood still pours . "
i hope that eid 's optimism is not misplaced when he calls on the president to enter " the battle of democracy with society against the sharks and dinosaurs who want to create discord between them in the service of their own interests and aims , which are limited by their own lack of vision .
and he will see that society is with him because our people are good and our nation as generous as the father who forgives the prodigal son . "
for my part i say that i view the young syrian president , until he proves otherwise , to be the offspring of the old regime and an organic extension of most of its policies , a participant with those who repeat yesteryear 's production , a man who has not only not stopped reconciliation with " the sharks and dinosaurs " but today he commemorates some of them when his father was keen to change them into ghosts and ashes !

at the invitation of the association , in the presence of a number of prominent political , economic , commercial and syndicate figures .
hamdan said , " the state has been unable to implement the bare minimum of the reforms which it promised us after the war . "
he criticized the high - interest and cash fixing policies pursued by former government , policies which encouraged profit - taking behavior .
he added , " what has been spent on construction and the pursuit of the policy of consolidating the divorce between industrial , agricultural and commercial sectors has not benefited the veins of the economy . " he warned of the " danger of continuing with things as they were , with the deficit eating into resources , which could reach the point where the state is unable to meet its payments . "
he clarified , " the american pressure brought to bear on lebanon , iran and syria will increase the scale of the grave economic problem . "
he enumerated the pros and cons of value - added tax , noting the importance of it being accompanied by " a range of measures and checks to guarantee that matters were proceeding in the right direction " .
he believed that " income tax , which is still low , is fairer than value - added tax " .
he responded to what has been said about cash fixing being in the service of the poor saying , " this fixing , which has helped to create the large public debt , impoverishes the middle classes and the poor , because financing and servicing the debt is done through taxes and from the pockets of the poor . "
about 70 citizens assembled at 8 pm yesterday evening in front of the entrance to quraitim palace , demanding to meet prime minister rafiq al-hariri who , at that time , was at the headquarters of the council of ministers in the museum .
these people , shareholders and deposit - holders in lebanon co - operatives held banners , such as " only the government is responsible for the tragedy , suffering and impoverishment of shareholders and deposit - holders (...) the contract with the al-muttahidah company is void and illegal " .
one of the shareholders in the co - operatives said , " we wanted to hear prime minister al-hariri in person because he is the only person we believe . "
after they had waited for about an hour outside , the guards agreed to allow a group of demonstrators to enter the palace to meet one of the officials .
at 9:15 the delegation came out announcing that they had formed a committee of 10 members and promised to resolve the issue within 10 days or they would return and sleep at the entrance to quraitim with their children if their problem was not resolved .

director of the association for vocational information jalal fawwaz , honorary president brigadier sami nasiri , captain muwwafaq al-yafi , secretary - general of the workshop yusif munsif , and a number of interested persons attended .
tripoli - al-nahar :
a meeting was held yesterday at the tripoli and the north chamber of commerce , industry and agriculture and was attended by the chairman of the chamber , abdallah ghandour , head of tripoli municipality , brigadier samir shaarani , director general of the saudi al-bariz exhibitions and festivals company , muhammad al-majali , the company 's representative for the company in lebanon , lamya al-rafii , and economic figures . this took place in the context of the preparations to organize the lebanese week " lebanon 2002 " for lebanese products and industries from the 6th to the 10th of next may at the headquarters of the riyadh exhibitions company ltd , in the city of riyadh , under the supervision of the lebanese embassy in the saudi capital .
ghandour spoke first and noted , " the saudi market is a market for lebanese products given that the kingdom is the biggest importer of lebanese products . the north 's share of the week and the accompanying activities in riyadh is fair . "
shaarani highlighted the importance of " sending to riyadh a model of tripoli , especially given that the purchasing power of the saudi capital is 3 billion dollars per month " .
he said , " the saudi market is characterized by being the largest purchasing and consumer power in the region in all areas . gold is an example , with the saudi market spending 10 billion dollars per annum in this area . there are others , such as school essentials , female products , and other fields in which the purchasing power of the saudi market is clear .
in the recent period lebanese merchants have withdrawn from the saudi market , which is not in the interests of lebanese businessmen and merchants , especially for the industrial sector . with this activity we are calling for a return , for them to build themselves and their relationship in saudi arabia , in view of the interest this holds for lebanese businessmen and investors . if they want to remain only in lebanon , then the future is not on their side , especially given that the lebanese economy is moving towards openness and globalization . perhaps what is taking place at present in relation to the abolishing of agency monopolies is relevant here .
tomorrow , when lebanon joins the world trade organization , then competition between lebanese merchants and everyone else will reach lebanon itself .
if these merchants do not develop themselves and their industries , they will find themselves in the future before the reality that lebanese consumers will not accept their goods because consumers generally have begun to search for brand , quality and price . lebanese merchants must therefore build a strategic relationship in arab states and always look for something better . "
are medicine and treatment the right of every citizen , and should they be subject to controls so as to become available to all ?
or are they consumer goods , subject to supply and demand , with whoever imports them having the right to impose the prices they want through a monopoly on these goods , thereby depriving citizens , especially those of the middleclass and below , of their right to treatment ?
it is true that the government 's budget is in the red , but the imposition of new direct and indirect taxes will not bring about the desired end .
it may be better to look for arrangements to reduce waste and support the budget .
for example , imposition of control over the price of medicines and prohibition of monopolies would save the government a lot of money , which currently ends up in the pockets of the importers .
this is not to exaggerate the issue : the cost of recovery in lebanon is twice what it is in neighboring countries , and even more in relation to some other countries .
health spending in lebanon exceeds 2 billion dollars , with the cost of medicine reaching 25 % of this , i . e . 500 million dollars , which should be measured against the population size of about 3.6 million people according to official statistics . individual spending on medicine in lebanon is therefore 138.8 dollars , compared to 17 dollars in syria ( whose annual health bill is 250 million dollars for 15 million people ) and 71 dollars in jordan ( where the annual bill is 300 million dollars for 4.2 million people ) .
the official pricing approved for medicine by the ministry of health is based on the following elements : approval of the price recommended by the monopoly agency plus 10 % profits for the importer , 22.5 % profits for the pharmacy and 40.5 % to cover various expenses and bonuses . the total thus added to the recommended price is 73 % . it should be borne in mind that the recommended price for the cost of medicine is usually exaggerated , thereby making the price increase unacceptable .
the large profit margin made by the monopoly agency and the failure of officials charged to check the accuracy of the recommended prices in the country of origin help to raise the prices of medicines when there is no competition to the monopoly on medicine . the social security organization , it should be recalled , previously conducted a successful trial , in which it imported a selection of medicines being sold in pharmacies and from the same source and sold it to those covered by the security at half the price adopted by the pharmacies .
there is an office for medicines at the ministry of health .
and there are staff there , but , as is the case with other government departments , they do not work .
so those with monopoly agencies import the medicine . they import more than 500 million dollars of medicine each year and it appears that they have the upper hand in preventing a neglected office in a government department from being made to work actively in order to prevent a cut in their profits as a result of effective control and checking being imposed by comparing the prices of other countries .
the government move to abolish the monopoly on medicine is good , provided that it does not hide a sharing of unrestricted profits and give an opportunity for new sharks to enter the market .
it is also good on the condition that the medicine office , which will save the government enormous expense being paid as increases in the prices of medicine , which ultimately found their way into the pockets of the monopoly holders . it will also save more than 50 % of the cost of medicine , further reduce waste and increase the capacity of the government to provide more services to citizens .
is the government strong enough to do this ?

the beirut discount market yesterday maintained calm and balance at the maximum of the bank of lebanon intervention point , selling american dollars at 1514.00 lira . the minimum purchase price also did not change at 1501.00 lira , closing , as has been the norm since 9 september 1999 , at an average price of 1507.50 lira .
however , in light of the development in demand and supply movement for the dollar , it was actually traded at the maximum end of the margin for central bank intervention and , occasionally , outside that margin . this took place in a market of weak activity with the total transactions not exceeding six million dollars . part of this sum was inter - bank sale and purchase trading at 1514.00 lira .
abroad , the dollar continued to hold against european currencies , whilst the yen improved after it was said that the japanese government intended to take a range of measures to revive the economy and deal with the possible bad bank debts on the eve of american president george bush 's visit to tokyo .
it was clear from trading that dealers were relaxed at the progress of the american economy . yesterday it transpired that the number of people seeking unemployment benefit in the united states fell by 8,000 compared to the previous week , with a total of 373,000 at the end of the week . this is an indication , on the one hand , of new job opportunities in various productions sectors other than agriculture and , on the other , that factory stock fell last december for the eleventh consecutive month by 0.4 % , compared with 1.2 % in november , whilst sales of this stock settled . such a development will pave the way for an increase in industrial production .
in contrast , economic information published yesterday on the other side of the atlantic will not reassure capitalists .
in this context , traders studied the announcement by the federal statistics office in germany to the effect that retail sales there have fallen by 0.1 % over the last year , compared to an expected rise of 0.5 % according to previous predictions and an actual rise of 2.2 % in 2000 . at the same time , new ventures in france fell last month by 1.2 % , after having stabilized in november and december 2001 .
in addition the european central bank announced that industrial production in the euro area recorded a fall of 0.6 % during the fourth quarter of last year , which also reflected negatively on the european currency against the dollar , which closed in london as follows :
- 0.8730 euro compared with 0.8715 yesterday in new york .
- 1.4300 sterling compared to 1.4285 .
- 1.6985 swiss franc compared to 1.6995 .
- 132.30 japanese yen compared to 133.35 .
- 1.5925 canadian dollars compared to 1.5895 .
gold prices improved slightly as a result of buying restarting below the 300.00 dollar per ounce threshold . it closed in london at 299.80 dollars , compared with 299.40 dollars the day before yesterday in new york , having been 298.10 dollars in the morning and 299.00 dollars in the afternoon .
the same applied to silver , which closed at 4.54 dollars per ounce , compared with 4.5020 dollars the day before yesterday in new york , having been 4.50 dollars at noon .
european stock markets continued to rise , supported by a strong opening from wall street and nasdaq , expectations of an international economic revival and the publication of encouraging results from various european companies and banks , notably glaxo smith kline , the union of swiss banks , ibn
imro and others .
the cac 40 index in paris closed up 64.86 points at 4429.31 points . the financial times index at the london stock exchange closed up 54.80 points at 5208.70 . the extra dax index at the frankfurt stock exchange closed up 38.42 points at 4973.77 points .
wall street and nasdaq were unable to hold the gains previously made at the opening , which was supported by good results from hewlett packard and encouraging results about the american economy .
from trading it was clear that dealers preferred to hurry to take what profits they could when nasdaq reached the 1900.00 threshold and the dow jones industrial index passed the 10,000 point mark and reached 10058.29 for the first time since the 10th of last december .
this development took place when the american network revealed that quest communications had been forced to resort to lines of credit from the banks after it had been unable to resettle its bonds in the money markets .
this development did encourage profit - taking , which quickly pushed the nasdaq index down below the 1850.00 mark and the dow jones index below the 10,000 point threshold , recording a mid - trading point during the evening session of 9970.94 points , a fall of 18.73 points the day before yesterday .
this was preceded in the morning by a rise on the tokyo stock exchange , with the nikai index crossing the 10,000 point threshold for the first time since the 29th of last december amidst evidence that the government is intensifying its efforts to boost the japanese economy and combat the fall in prices . the index closed up 112.74 points at 10081.09 points .
minister for social affairs asaad diab , in his capacity as president of the lebanese information assembly , announced that a workshop would be held under the title " information technology in the service of tourism " in participation with the joint european commission .
this will be at 9 am tomorrow , saturday , at the sea rock hotel , al-rushah .
diab held a press conference at the same hotel to announce the workshop .
director of the association for vocational information jalal fawwaz , honorary president brigadier sami nusiri , captain muwwafaq al-yafi , secretary - general of the workshop yusif munsif , and a number of interested persons attended .
diab said , " information technology is the third technological revolution in history . it recognizes no limits , neither in time , nor distance .
it develops extremely rapidly and pervades all fields to form a fundamental part of our daily life . "
he added , " following the recommendations of the barcelona conference , the information community directorate general of the european union approved funding for projects to establish relations between north and south , in order to activate various economic sectors in the field of information technology .
this conference opened the way to thinking about ways of developing tourism , including building a modern information infrastructure .
and so was a new industry born : tourism information technology . "
he pointed out that the workshop would deal in detail with the topic of " information technology in the tourism sector " and is funded by the european commission as part of the scholastic project , which brings together 4 european partners and 6 south - mediterranean partners , including lebanon .
it is expected that it will be followed by activities and conference for various other sectors , including : medical care , manufacture and management of information technology incubators .
he said , " tourism is one of the top three sectors of international tourism , and the only one that can bring together and so unite civilizations , thereby establishing new socio - economic dimensions . "
he noted , " this workshop will allow workers in the tourism sector , from public and private sectors , such as the ministry of tourism and hotel and travel agent representatives , to express their needs .
producers and developers of services , represented by local and european companies will provide information solutions and respond to question about matters relating to the improvement of tourist services ; activation of tourism marketing via information technologies and ways of conducting a virtual visit of our museums , and archeological and historical sites (...) by computer ; organization and management of journeys and accommodation according to personal requirements ; ways of investing in the tourist industry in lebanon ; and implementation of information technologies in the syrian tourism sector . "
diab concluded , " this event provides some answers by providing a detailed presentation of advanced practical applications in lebanon and europe . it will conclude with a meeting to involve lebanese and european organizations , the aim of which is to establish and consolidate foundations for cooperation and partnership . "
h . a .
when the first egyptian - arab satellite , nilesat , was launched on 28 april 1998 , media circles were betting on the development of arab - arab and arab - west competition in the sphere of modern communication technology investment , which would lead to a media renaissance and put the arabs , in the first quarter of the twenty - first century , on the international circuit for the communication technology revolution and expand the footprint of arab media .
at that time the arab satellite and media field comprised intelsat and arabsat , whilst there were tens of other satellites in the world , which not only stormed the communications markets by their advanced technology , but also by their lease and service prices . the only ones to remain in the field would be those that could deal with the conditions present at the time , which might require worldly - wisdom and responsibility .
today , with the lebanese satellite channel joining the group of organizations dealing with nilesat , the lebanese media have struck a new decisive blow and realized some of the bets referred to above .
on the one hand , it is a firm step in the age of the " arabisation " much cherished by sheikh bayyar al-dahir , who first pronounced the idea at the end of the last century by expressing his desire to enter " globalisation " from a common arab gateway , even one that includes domestic competition , that would be capable of keeping pace with the american , japanese and european west , with its aspirations to control the oriental media markets .
on the other , it confirmed the ability of the private media to compete with the official media supported both materially and morally by arab governments , to secure a very broad footprint in the middle east and africa in preparation for another possible deployment in other areas of the world , which the arab media , and the lebanese media specifically , have not yet reached .
the details of the contract signed between the lebanese satellite channel and the egyptian satellite company ( nilesat ) have demonstrated that the latter 's satellite covers north africa and , specifically , all of egypt , and that it attracts almost 10 million viewers . in the lexicon of footprint and effective profit this means that there are ten million viewers who prefer to use a system that does not require a large receptor dish , or require the user to pay for digital subscription and a decoder in order to view .
this lebanese television organization , which still broadcasts on arabsat and reaches saudi arabia , the united arab emirates , kuwait and other countries , has expanded its viewer base in these countries , and in egypt and north africa by means of nilesat , the two systems and .
the wind quarter , which comprises teachers from the lebanese national conservatory and players from the national symphony orchestra , gathered in the bayyar abu khatir hall at the faculty of human sciences , jesuit university , for an evening which brought together composers from different times who had composed pieces for groups of wind instruments , bringing out the abilities of a chamber orchestra comprising flute , oboe , clarinet , bassoon and horn to vary breathing and color the melody according to the capacities and virtues of each instrument .
nabil marwah on the flute , robir jiyukar on the oboe , marius ifansia on the clarinet , thomas gitovsky on the bassoon and jessica garail on the horn played four selections . the first was by guiseppe maria campini , a quintet in the manner of this italian composer from the end of the 18th century , who devoted three quintets to wind instruments among his numerous symphonic works and his startling compositions for violin and orchestra .
in its accurate rendition the quintet brought out the virtues of this composer and the richness of his poetic orchestration , with each instrument drawing a unique voice and characteristics which we followed through the players as the group wove a musical tapestry through which we could distinguish each player by their instrument .
perhaps this music , as it was presented in the four selections , bore in its composition a geometric construction more than a literary value in which the ear would find expression and , on its wings , reach the peak of emotion .
skillful expressions brought out the charms of the instrument and the ability of the player . for the summer outing by giano , with its five movements , was like a breath of fresh air in the wilderness .
it was as if the players were running in delight and laughter .
the infection of nabil marwah 's flute reached us in grace and clarity . the oboe quarreled and was joined by the clarinet in a flourishing round , which soon included the bassoon and the horn .
enjoyable expressions , easy to absorb , but what skill they required from the breathing of each player , a skill that was still apparent in the second half of the evening , with kloghart 's quintet , as was the harmony that we had noticed gracefully and sharply penetrating the nature and mood of the work .
the oboe , which resides between the voice of the clarinet and bassoon , opened the allegro gravely and touchingly . the flute joined in for a very short while before the rays of this piece became even more delicious . at the adagio the oboe returned to take its role as guide to the meaning of kloghart 's music , inviting the flute to an increasing celebration on the scale of instruments and breaths .
in a brief , sharp expression , abbreviating the genius of its composer , the quintet concluded with rimski korsakov 's " bee " , the only quintet written for the flute , clarinet , trumpet , bassoon and oboe .
a piece in which there is both a mix of the queen bee and the worker , or a project to make honey and find a mate .
the humming brought out from the instruments , from the lungs of the players , moving pictures that each instrument then colored according to its qualities and the vivacity and skill of each player .

army commander brigadier michel sulaiman held a dinner in honor of justice nasri lahud at the ministry of defense restaurant on the occasion of his transfer from the military judiciary to chairmanship of the supreme council of justice .
minister of national defense khalil al-harawi , members of the military council and a number of judges and officers attended .
brigadier sulaiman gave a speech in which he thanked lahud for his efforts in the government commission with the military court , noting that " he stemmed from a family that had borne the worries of the nation , whose father , jamil lahud , was a prominent national figure , whose brother his excellency , president of the republic , emil lahud , had the main merit in building the military institution " .
the army commander recalled the words of president lahud that " a free and wholly independent judiciary protects the state of law and institutions " .
he added , " the military institution is the backbone of other institutions and protects the state of law ; to attack it is to attack the law of the state . "
he concluded by stressing the need for " continued military justice , to accelerate cases of crimes perpetrated against the security of the state and against military figures , in addition to those perpetrated by the military " , attributing this to " the continued israeli threat to lebanon , its security and stability " .
lahud then made a speech in which he said : " on this celebration which brings us together today on the occasion of my transfer to the chairmanship of the supreme council of justice , i can only bow before the magnificence of the military institution , maker of men , and a school for honor and chivalry , the minister for which is khalil al-harawi and led today by brigadier michel sulaiman , the wise leader who works , as did his predecessor , his excellency , brigadier emil lahud , day and night , determinedly and in silence , to stop the homeland from hemorrhaging and establish a state of institutions .
this is our army , the army of the proud , the great and the noble , as tall as the cedars of lebanon , as pure as the snow on its peaks and as solid as the rocks of our mountains .
you protect the country , you are the eyes that remain awake over the country and you are the men . without you there would not be security , nor would there be a state , and nor would the banners of pride , truth and justice have been raised .
you work in silence , remain awake without tiring or becoming bored for the security of citizens and the well being of the country . you remain steadfast in the face of self - interested conferences and stand against the treacherous israeli enemy with honor , sacrifice and determination .
fate and circumstance have led me to the judiciary when i always wanted to be one of the soldiers in this institution . how could it have been otherwise when i grew up in a home that taught me the principles of honor , sacrifice and loyalty ?
from the military court to the supreme council of justice . today i give up one past and turn a new page in which i was honored to have been the first military chief investigating magistrate , then commissioned by the government to the military courts , from where i am to be transferred to the supreme council of justice .
it is difficult for me to leave you today when i have a lump in my throat at the position that i have occupied in the military judiciary . but i will continue to work with you , hand in hand , to continue to realize the truth and to prevent those criminals who would undermine the security of the homeland .
for it is from the glint in the blades of your swords that justice shines in lebanon , that security is established that the citizens are reassured about today and tomorrow . "
the minister of defense then gave a speech in which he extolled the virtues of justice lahud from the time he had first come to know him in the 1950s and focused on " justice lahud continuing the security tract , his efforts and clear independence " , noting that " to try to curry favor with justice lahud was not possible " .
at the end , the army commander presented the armour of the army in commemoration to justice lahud and toasts were exchanged .

after he was welcomed in a speech given by colleague saad kiwan , ubaid gave a historical overview of the clash of cultures and the reality of cultural dialogue .
he dealt with the lebanese role in the dialogue of civilizations and cultures , believing it to be unique in both the arab and western worlds .
the al-maqasid islamic charitable association in beirut called for the conducting of elections for members of its board of trustees from 9 am to 2 pm on sunday , 17 february , at the higher national nursing institute .
la jocund social and cultural club organized a seminar entitled " good citizenship through life in common " in the lecture hall of al-qasr al-baladi , zuq mikail , in which the mufti of tripoli and the north , sheikh taha al-sabonji , mr. hani fahs from the arab team for islamic - christian dialogue , former director general of the maronite brotherhood of mary abbot saad nimr , and sheikh sami abu al-muna . dr michel kaadi led the seminar .
district president of kasrawan al-futuh rimon hitti , representing the president of the republic , deputies faris said , nazim al-khuri and mansur ghanim al-bon , former deputy kamil ziyadah and col. ibrahim jirjis , representing the army commander , secretary - general of the maronite association dr khalil karam , head of the kasrawan - al-futuh union of municipalities nihad nofal , director of the al-irfan al-tawhidiyyah schools sheikh ali zain al-din , former director of the maronite brotherhood of mary abbot marcel abi khalil , director general of the maronite lebanese missionary association fr khalil ilwan , sheikh clauvis al-khazin , and a group of party , social and cultural notables .
mufti al-sabonji spoke about the concept of life in common and good citizenship , calling for " sincere work to bring about national unity , not at the level of individual sects but at the level of the nation , far removed from the reactions , incitement , fears and suspicions common these days . "
he explained the history of the relationship between islam and christianity and that of muslims to christians " as a basis for the necessary collective national unity " , stressing that islam " naturally differs from christianity , but does not contradict it or constitute a danger to it " .
he said , " if history shows there to have been some outside oppression of lebanon 's christians , this is due to non - religious causes and is contrary to islamic justice . muslims themselves have been subject to such oppression , and have suffered its evil and its consequences , which has delayed their role in civilization and imposed upon them their current reality . "
he added , " today some lebanese christians are anxious at the future as a result of the increase in christian emigration from lebanon . this emigration is not restricted to them : it includes both muslims and christians . its cause is not religious persecution but a continuation of the path of our forefathers in leaving the country on account of the limited land available in lebanon , and on account of the aspirations of the lebanese and their success in countries abroad .
if christian emigration seems to be a flight of christians from lebanon , this is fundamentally linked to the economic conditions of the country , not to religion or a desire on the part of muslims . lebanon is a country for all of its children , muslims and christians . all lebanese are the same in their devotion to their homeland and their collective national unity . "
in his contribution , fahs dealt with the fears of christians in the east generally , and in lebanon specifically , believing them to be " exactly the same as the fears of muslims in the caucasus , bosnia and herzek , kosovo and the west generally . "
he believed , " the fears of christians in lebanon ultimately touch upon the concept of the lebanese nation , which is negatively affected by the diminishment of any of its groups of which it is made up , without which it does not stand and without which they do not stand . "
he stressed , " democracy cannot be divided . deterioration in the quality of christian representation will lead to qualitative tyranny over quality for muslim representation , which will certainly harm muslims . this reality can be seen in lebanon now and is growing year on year . "
sheikh sami abu al-muna said , " our concept of citizenship must go beyond the limits of duties to secure the rights of the citizens in their nation . the state is principally responsible for securing these rights by justice and equality . the foremost rights are those of freedom and democracy , the right to knowledge and education , and the right to a dignified living , security and stability . "
in his contribution abbot nimr mentioned the contents of the apostolic guide " a new hope for lebanon " on life in common , which calls for " dialogue that takes into account the feelings of different people and groups as an inevitable tool for life in common and building society " .
" they failed to renew capitalism , so they renewed poverty . " i have borrowed this sentence from the book " a picture of the boy in red " by fawwaz tarabolsi , which he made as a comment on the unemployment caused by corporate restructuring in france at the end of the 1980s .
today it applies to lebanon .
they have failed to renew the institutions and laws , so they renewed poverty .
i asked the girl collecting donations to buy medicine for the impoverished parish elderly . " do you believe that this is the right way to solve the problem ? "
she said that the parish priest had decided on it after he had knocked on the doors of senior officials but found no one to listen .
this same activity was carried out by men of religion on an individual basis before the war among their flock in the poor areas .
and what the young men and women of today are doing today as part of religious work of the parish was also done by atheists , fascists and socialists who took part in social work during the same period .
old socialists , most of whom today occupy position in the press or are politically active in the opposition or in support of the government , remember the slogans that were repeated between 1970 and 1975 , when a group of people of influence and their close associates gained control of the country 's economy , until the country came under the control of foreign capitalists and workers were dismissed from companies and factories in order to maintain profit margins .
from the struggle for social gains , especially social security , which today stands under threat , to the sudden disappearance of the middle class , whom we have lamented for years .
the idea was also put forward at that time to boycott the elections in protest at the impossibility of effecting change by means of them , because they were tailored to fit the size of those in power and those who wanted them .
it was also said : we can protest by means of the white paper .
why did the lebanese people put off their participation with the university students on the day they demonstrated against value - added tax ?
why has our protest become limited to chatter on the buses and in taxis ?
two days ago a taxi driver said to me that the country was always demonstrating before the war for their living . but today they have tamed the people .
yesterday a second driver said to me after i got in to his car , " i was listening to ziad al-rahbani " , as if he was asking permission to continue the play .
he pressed the button of the cassette recorder and we heard the discussion between " rashid " and the nurse in the play " a long american film " .
in the evening broadcasts of " the voice of the people " i noticed the repeated requested for songs from the cassette " i 'm not an unbeliever " produced by ziad muntasif in the 1980s , at the height of speculation on the dollar , when one group gained at the expense of the rest of the people .
i told the driver , " the plays and songs of ziad al-rahbani are an indicator of the economic and political situation of the people .
they come back whenever the situation gets bad . "
in conclusion to the activities of " kuwait , cultural capital of the arab world for 2001 " , and in response to the invitation of the abd al-aziz saud al-babtin prize institution , george tarbih , member of the council of trustees of the institution in lebanon , took part in the arab seminar held on the centenary of the death of kuwaiti poet abdallah al-faraj and of the birth of lebanese poet amin nakhlah .
at this " birth and death " centenary seminar , the lebanese delegation distinguished itself in terms of administration , research , critical contributions and artistic paintings , under the leadership of fr dr eli kasrawani .
tarbih had also composed a poem about amin nakhlah , which he recently recited at an evening organized by the cultural dialogue circle , ain al-ramanah , where dr amirah abu murad gave a welcome speech and researcher jan tanus a word of introduction .
tarbih 's poem runs thus :
oh , nakhlah , master poet , boast among the arabs .
where his pure soul blossomed and was nurtured .
looked over and protected by the daughter of white villages .
who sang to him and gave him the choicest wine to drink .
until he slept , absent - minded , like al-mutanabbi .
amin nakhlah - from which star did you fall ?
your comet burns bright with life .
i recall your pastures infused by heaven 's breath .
i recall the haughty sermon in jaras .
and the whispering steps by which the herd was revealed .
your way killed the hunchback hag .
i recall your brightly woven cascade .
god 's fingertips wrote the first letter .
you are the palm tree in a jungle of pens .
you carve wordy jewels .
enwrapped , you bear the poet 's mace .
heir to the praise of the greatest arab chief .
amin - where are those who protect poetry from prattle ?
ignored because they deny the arabic language .
here , son of sincerity , the swords of fidelity rusted .
in kuwait , where the characteristics of the arabs were gathered .
rejoice , prince of rhythm , at being in a country .
where the emirate boasts with the son of its selfsame essence .
they revive the memory of abdallah bin faraj .
in al-babtin , the poetic columns raise it up .
a nation that has tired of its leaders ' weakness .
amin - rise up like a giant and avenge poetry .
right hand - set the forest alight . but no .
for lebanon 's nakhlah has grown branches .
in kuwait raise nakhlah to poetry .
crown the zenith of literature with the amin .
your free branches high among the years .
on his behalf circumstances protect the child with their eyelashes .
and deliver him safely to the rocking clouds .
that tames its steeds in the court of wonders .
your intelligence sheds light on the darkened tomes .
in which your letters form a chain of comets .
the eternal breath comes to me from the unknown .
and a helmet for the master jumpers in the valleys .
on the roads of a moist autumn .
twisting at length , it rests from fatigue .
a silver rope of effervescent beads .
forming a torrent of fire for the letters of creation .
imam ali 's brother in the sky of degrees .
its letters transformed into golden treasure .
the kingly cloak decorated with pure gold , embroidered .
in the son 's proud anthem to the father unrivalled .
from the criminals and infidels of every prophet .
the leader is scarce and they the worms of the earth .
its blades are sharpened in these books .
the people of kuwait are mine , and arab .
a brother to lebanon for better or worse .
they come with the creative in a noisy retinue .
and bring al-amin to the land of original kinship .
to raise the banner of literature from its decay .
as we weep over the ruins and debris .
how poetry filled us with longing in its new gown .
leaving behind dry stalks , without mercy for the perpetrators .
you have overshadowed us in the land of superior minds .
here are the chippings of the woodcutter - so gather !

president of the international football federation , fifa , joseph sepp blatter yesterday began a visit to lebanon - his second after a previous visit in october 2000 on the occasion of the finals of the 2000 asia - lebanon cup .
he was accompanied by members of the federation 's executive committee , muhammad bin hamam and abdallah al-dubl , and his advisor jerome champagne .
he was met at the al-masnaa point on the syrian / lebanese border by a delegation from the lebanese football federation , which included president hashim haidar , secretary - general bahij abu hamzah , and members george solaj , mustafa hamdan and jabrin habibian .
from there he and those accompanying him traveled to the headquarters of the ministry of youth and sport , where he was met by minister dr sebouh hovnanian in the presence of director general zaid khayyami .
he then went to the headquarters of the lebanese federation in firdan and held with officials a working meeting that included federation members fuad jarudi , haitham shaaban , musa makki , rimun samaan and adil bisar .
the secretariat general of the lebanese federation reported that blatter began the meeting by congratulating the supreme committee of the lebanese football federation on its election . this was followed by a presentation on the crisis through which the game in lebanon had passed some months earlier , which had resulted in fair and democratic elections .
the fifa president said that the crisis had passed and that page turned . he confirmed that the international federation was prepared for all cooperation with the lebanese federation .
he asked the supreme council to prepare a program of work in preparation for submission to the international federation for discussion , before specialists from fifa would be sent to follow up implementation of its clauses .
blatter and the delegation accompanying him expressed their delight at the rebirth of lebanese football , notably the first class general league championship . they valued the positive spirit that they had found at the beginning of their visit to lebanon and following their meeting with the minister of youth and sport , commending the close co - operation between the ministry and the lebanese federation .
he concluded by stressing the role of lebanon in the family of the international football federation .
today the fifa president will continue his visit by meeting the three heads of state and conclude it with a press conference at beirut international airport shortly before departing beirut .
before arriving in beirut , blatter had laid the foundation stone for the new headquarters of the syrian football federation in the al-faha sport city as part of the " fifa goal " project funded by the international federation , during his first visit to syria .
he and the delegation accompanying him were met by syrian vice president zuhair masharaqah in the presence of the delegation accompanying him and the president of the syrian football association , brigadier faruq buzu .
in a press conference he stated that he was confident of being reelected to the presidency of fifa , explaining that he had received letters from 112 countries who are members of the international federation confirming their support for his candidacy .
he confirmed that the financial status of the federation was very comfortable and that it could meet all its obligations after having experienced some difficulties .

united nations secretary - general kofi anan yesterday played down the importance of the statements made by baghdad to the effect that iraq will not allow the return of international weapons inspectors . he said that the public statements did not necessarily reflect reality .
deputy chairman of iraq 's revolutionary command council izzat ibrahim al-duri left cairo following his lightning visit to egypt , during which he met with president husni mubarak .
at the united nations headquarters in new york last week , anan met with an iraqi delegation headed by foreign minister naji sabri al-hadithi to discuss the issue of the return of weapons inspectors , who withdrew from iraq in december 1998 .
these talks will continue in the second half of next april .
iraq 's vice president taha yasin ramadan confirmed last sunday that his country would not permit the weapons inspectors to return .
at a press conference the secretary - general of the international organization said , " as far as i am concerned , the talks are taking place behind closed doors and these public statements do not necessarily reflect reality . the next time that a closed meeting is held (...) my aim is that iraq should respect the resolutions of the united nations . during our next meeting i will concentrate on what the iraqi envoy says , and not on what i read in the press .
asked about the first round of talks with sabri , he responded , " we have begun relatively well but it is only the beginning and no one can say whether we will succeed or fail . "
he stressed that the return of inspectors was not up for discussion : " our task is clear .
i am focusing on the demands set out in the resolutions of the council . i do not want to go any further than that . "
the egyptian president also appeared to play down the reports of the iraqi media .
in a joint press conference with american vice president dick cheney on wednesday , he expressed the belief that iraqi president saddam hussein " would accept the return of the inspectors " .
whilst washington approved a second round of talks between anan and al-hadithi , american secretary of state colin powell opposed the continuation of talks without a clear deadline .
baghdad put about 20 questions to anan , including one question as to how it could ensure that the american administration would not use the new inspection teams to spy or draw up a list of targets for bombing .
american officials accepted in 1998 that they had planted spies among the inspectors .
anan said that baghdad had also objected to the two no - fly zones imposed by the united states and britain over northern and southern iraq .
the deputy chairman of the iraqi revolutionary command council left cairo without making any statement . a source close to the egyptian presidency said that mubarak had informed al-duri of " the results of his talks with american vice president " in sharm al-shaikh .
al-duri visited jordan , lebanon and syria as part of a tour aiming to mobilize arab opposition to any campaign mounted by the united states against iraq .
the iraqi press agency ( waa ) announced that vietnamese vice president nguyen thi binh had arrived in baghdad on a visit that will continue until sunday .
it quoted her as saying , " the vietnamese leadership wishes to strengthen and develop economic and commercial relations between the two countries in such a way as to improve relations to the level aspired to by the leadership of these two friendly countries . "
it explained , " current cooperation between the two countries is progressing rapidly in all areas . "
ramadan , who met with her , expressed " his confidence that friendly relations and cooperation between the two countries are progressing in a model way , having witnessed noticeable positive developments . it has been possible to arrive at a joint program of action and joint investments . "
the vietnamese official is accompanied by a large official delegation , in addition to businessmen .

kuala lumpur - reuters - director of the federal bureau of investigation ( fbi ) robert mueller yesterday discounted the possibility that malaysia had been used as the launch pad for the 11 september attacks against the us , but he did say that the perpetrators of the attacks may have visited it .
following his meeting with the inspector general of the malaysian police nurian mai , he stated , " there are a number of states in which the terrorists plotted , but the use of the phrase launch pad ( in connection with malaysia ) is not certain to be correct . "

beijing - reuters - the china daily newspaper reported yesterday that china is working to develop space rockets that will bring it closer to the dream of sending one of its astronauts into space .
it announced the end of the study to develop the rockets in order to speed up the chinese space program and provide international services in this area . efforts are now focusing on the production of experimental models of these rockets .
it clarified that the new rockets would use liquid hydrogen and would bring the capability of chinese missiles closer to the technologies used by other countries . new rockets would also be used to send giant space telescopes and lunar and mars exploration craft .
it quoted the director of the chinese space science and technology agency jang jingwai as saying that " the development of the new generation of launch craft is crucial to push the country to enter the international space field " .

the presidents of serbia and montenegro yesterday signed an historic agreement in belgrade to change fundamentally the form and structure of yugoslavia , giving the state a new name and granting these two republics greater self - rule . it further ushers in a new era of relations between them , representing a " break " with the era of former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic . the step has received strong european support because it is believed that it will stop , at least for the immediate future , the final break up of what remains of the former yugoslavia .
the agreement was signed by yugoslav president voislav kostunica for serbia , montenegro 's president milo djukanovic for montenegro , and the eu higher representative for common foreign and security policy javier solano .
montenegro 's prime minister filip vujanovic , his serbian counterpart zoran djindjic and the deputy yugoslav prime minister miroljub labus also signed .
the agreement sets out the principles for the declaration of the new state , which is to bear the name " serbia and montenegro " , for a minimum of three years .
the new entity will comprise two semi - independent member states with one president , a single chamber parliament , cabinet and court , and a joint foreign and defense policy . each will have its own economy , currency and taxes .
it also provides for the conduct of new federal elections in the autumn .
after a minimum of three years , " both members states shall have the right to resort to measures aiming to change the legal status of the state , namely to withdraw from the federation " .
it deals with the issue of the kosovo region , the future of which is linked to security council resolution 1244 , passed in 1999 , which calls for the establishment of expanded autonomy within the framework of the federal republic of yugoslavia , the days of which are numbered .
the agreement states that " if montenegro wishes to withdraw from the federal state , the international documents relating to federal republic of yugoslavia , in particular resolution 1244 for kosovo , will apply to serbia as successor to the federal republic of yugoslavia " .
following the signing kostunica stated , " the agreement provides the basis for a completely new redefinition of relations between serbia and montenegro . "
he said , " this step means a break from the former regime " of milosovic .
he pointed out , " amidst fears of a break - up in the balkans , we are making progress towards unification , peace and stability in the region and europe . "
he clarified that the agreement would be put before the parliaments of serbia , montenegro and the current federal republic of yugoslavia ( serbia and montenegro ) before becoming " a constitutional document with constitutional legitimacy " .
solano said , " it is a very important day for the european union and for me in particular .
together we have taken an important step towards stability in the region and europe . "
he promised to provide aid and support from the european union .
djukanovic , who is expected to face opposition from supporters of montenegro 's independence , praised the agreement , which allowed for the preservation of " the basic structures of the economic systems and reforms in montenegro and the important mechanisms for integration of the economic system between montenegro and the european union " .
a spokesman for the socialist party led by milosovic commented on the agreement by saying that it was " the most shameful day in serbian history " .
yugoslavia , it is noted , was established for the first time in 1918 with the accession of the present states of serbia , croatia , slovakia and montenegro .
slovakia , croatia , macedonia , bosnia and herzek declared their independence in 1992 whilst serbia and montenegro remained together .

following the reelection of president mugabe in elections condemned by the international community for the flaws they involved , zimbabwe 's government is expected to face harsher international sanctions , especially given that the league of commonwealth nations has joined american and british criticisms of the violations and atmosphere in which the elections were conducted .
observation teams from the former british colonies reported that the elections were improperly conducted to the extent that the results did not express the will of the people of zimbabwe .
but african observation teams , including the african unity organization mission , the nigerian observation team and the south african mission , defended the legitimacy of mugabe 's victory .
in a speech broadcast on his arrival in harare yesterday , he said " those who doubt the election process in zimbabwe " must " listen to what the africans are saying " .
meanwhile the governments of the united states and britain threatened to intensify sanctions against mugabe and his allies . the european union hinted at more punitive measures .
on wednesday evening , following the declaration that mugabe had won a new six - year term of office , american president george bush stated , " we do not recognize the election results because we believe them to be flawed (...) we are consulting with our friends to decide how to deal with these flawed elections . "
previously , american secretary of state colin powell said that the results of the elections did not reflect the will of zimbabwe 's people .
in a statement he said , " the elections results allow mr. mugabe to claim victory but they do not allow him to claim that he has democratic legitimacy . "
head of the commonwealth mission , former nigerian president abd al-salam abu bakr , noted , " the conditions in zimbabwe do not appropriately allow free and fair expression of the will of the electorate . "
in an interview with the bbc , new zealand prime minister helen clarke believed that the commonwealth union faced a " crisis " over " the lack of stability " in the application of principles .
she expressed anxiety at the situation in zimbabwe because " a very small group of states " were defending it with " excessive force " .
united nations secretary - general kofi anan also stated that he was " worried " at the situation in zimbabwe .

the scottish appeals court held in camp zeist in central holland yesterday confirmed the guilt of libyan abdelbaset al-megrahi , aged 49 , on the charge of mass murder in the case of the pan american airline bombing above lockerbie in scotland in 1988 , which left 270 dead . it upheld the sentence of life imprisonment given against him . this closes the door on a detective " story " and judicial investigation that have continued for about 13 years and increases pressure on the libyan leader col. muammar gaddafi to acknowledge the responsibility of his country for the incident and to pay compensation to victims ' families .
but tripoli quickly criticized the ruling , describing it as political and made under british and american pressure . it sought al-megrahi 's release .
meanwhile , washington and london welcomed it .
during a session lasting less than five minutes , justice lord mccullen , who heads the appeals court comprising five judges , said , " none of the pretexts on which the appeal is based are valid . . . consequently the appeal is rejected . "
al-megrahi , a secret libyan agent aged 49 , who has been detained at camp zeist in holland since libya handed him over on 5 april 1999 , was transferred to a scottish prison where his sentence will be spent .
he received the ruling without emotion , whilst his wife , aishah , who was sat in the back rows of the court , burst into tears .
relatives of the victims expressed their satisfaction , although they demanded that an independent committee be set up to investigate the holes in security that allowed the bomb onto the boeing 747 .
the court of first instance found al-megrahi guilty on 31 january 2001 of mass murder after finding him guilty of having sent a suitcase containing a bomb from malta airport to frankfurt , where it was transferred to the pan am flight , which later landed in london before exploding 38 minutes after take - off from heathrow airport on its way to new york above the town of lockerbie . the other accused in the same case , libyan al-amin khalifah fahimah , was found not guilty because of insufficient evidence .
al-megrahi 's lawyers tried during the appeal to establish that the bomb was put on board in london , not malta . they focused on a statement made by a retired security guard at heathrow airport , in which he said that he had discovered that the lock of the baggage hold had been tampered with on the night before the plane took off , indicating that someone may have put the bomb in the suitcase that blew up the plane .
after the ruling was give , the head of the libyan lawyers , hafiz khujah told journalists outside the court , " the libyan people and the whole arab world is frustrated , " stressing that the matter was political and not judicial because the whole world knew that there was no conclusive evidence of al-megrahi 's involvement .
britain jim swire , who led a campaign demanding justice after he lost his daughter in the incident , said , " it is not the time to celebrate . it is a time for unity and solidarity to ensure that this does not happen again . "
cathleen flynn , who lost her son shouted out , " finally justice has been done . "
in tripoli , the general people 's committee of the people 's office for foreign communications and international communication expressed in its statement , " its great astonishment " at the ruling , which " like , its predecessor , was based on circumstantial evidence , the veracity of which had not been established " .
it said , " this confirms once more that britain and the us have imposed their influence on the court to secure a political ruling , one that has nothing to do with the law , but , in fact , is based on contradictory legal reasons , misleading evidence and unjustified conclusions . "
it noted that the appeal decision " ignored new evidence submitted by the defense to the court " and confirmed tripoli 's " complete " conviction that " al-megrahi is innocent and that the appeal ruling issued against him is political and has been imposed by certain parties " .
it sought the release of its national and " the full and immediate lifting of the unjust sanctions imposed by the security council against the jamahiriya by british and american pressures and that the libyan people be compensated for the material and human damages suffered as a result thereof " .
* in washington , white house spokesman ari fleischer stated , " the american government is satisfied at the decision of the scottish high court (...) and we stress once more the importance of the libyan government moving quickly to respond to the requirements of security council resolutions concerning the attack on pan am flight 103 . "
he added that the ruling made by the appeals court " does not end the sanctions imposed against libya , but it should push it to move quickly to comply with all united nations resolutions " .
in london british foreign minister jack straw welcomed the ruling .
he told journalists some minutes after it had been announced that al-megrahi being found guilty did not compensate for the suffering of the victims ' families but " i hope that it offers them some peace and consolation " .
he noted that his government would examine the reasons on which the court had based its judgment rejecting the appeal .

indian prime minister atal bihari vajpayee yesterday called for solidarity and peace following the sectarian violence that left more than 700 dead in the state of gujarat at the end of february . the indian authorities have sent more security reinforcements to the city of ayodha on the eve of the date set by hindu extremists for a religious festival banned by the high court , near the site where they intend to build a temple to their high god rama on the ruins of the babri mosque , which was destroyed by extremists from among their number ten years earlier , which led to disturbances in which three thousand died .
the atmosphere in ayodha is one of expectation following the announcement by some hindu extremists that they intended to challenge the high court ruling and hold prayers near the disputed site .
amidst fears of renewed sectarian violence , shops and schools were closed yesterday and the streets were empty apart from a small number of civilians .
military trucks poured into the area carrying mechanized artillery and troops who joined those deployed in the area a few days ago , which has transformed the city of about one hundred thousand inhabitants into a closed quasi - military camp .
police at crossroads stopped anyone not carrying a special permit .
the " trust of india " agency reported that the police had detained about one thousand hindu activists heading from gorakhpur to ayodha to take part in the celebration , including hindu clerics and a local deputy from the bharatiya janata party , which is headed by vajpayee .
the police in lucknow , capital of the state of uttar pradesh , said that about 400 hindus had been detained across the state .
but the chairman of committee for construction of the " rama " temple in ayodha , baramhans ramshandra das , said that he would take part in the celebration at 2:15 and " if one of them stops me , my life will end " .
a spokesman for the world hindu conference " vishwa hindu parishad " , bravin tughadya said that religious hindus from all over india would visit temples and would come down into the streets at the same time to demand the construction of the temple .
he said that the hindus would launch a " people 's campaign " to build the temple if the police opened fire on religious enthusiasts or detained some of them today .
at a session of the indian chamber of deputies , vajpayee called for solidarity .
he said , " i take this opportunity to call all political and non - political organizations in the country to cooperate with the government . . . to maintain security and sectarian fusion . "
despite this peaceful call , the session was postponed after an opposition deputy blamed the prime minister for his support of the hindus .
the city of baroda in the state of gujarat witnessed various incidents on wednesday evening when hindus attacked and burnt muslim homes .
in addition , three people were killed and 25 others wounded by a bomb explosion on a train in the state of punjab in the north of the country .
officials said that the explosion did not appear to be linked to developments in ayodha .
* in washington , the american state department warned its nationals against traveling to areas in india . its statement said , " non - essential american government trips to gujarat have been postponed . . . american citizens must also avoid traveling to the area . "
the americans strongly advised against travel to ayodha and the surrounding areas in the state of uttar pradesh .

written by nicola nasif :
the official position of lebanon , after syria , did not meet with the reactions that welcomed the last resolution of the security council , number 1397 .
as with their initial reservations towards the initiative of saudi crown prince abdallah bin abd al-aziz , on the grounds that it lacked the elements for a comprehensive settlement , so too they found in the security council resolution the same justifications for the same reservation , namely that resolution 1397 ignores a comprehensive settlement and fails to condemn israel .
however , diplomatic information arriving in beirut in the last few hours from sources that followed closely the discussions that accompanied the resolution talks about the motives in which the syria reservation was concealed :
1 - despite the fact that there is evidence suggesting that the resolution was prepared without prior consultation with the arab community at the international organization , there is other evidence that speaks of arab pressure imposed on syria , the non - permanent member on the security council , to make it withdraw a draft resolution it had proposed that contained explicit condemnation of israeli attacks against palestinian territory and palestinian inhabitants . discussions were held in this respect in order to polarize support for it .
as a result of this pressure , the syrian representative on the security council , mikhail wahbah , withdrew the draft resolution after he confirmed that the resolution put forward by the united states had gained the support of most members of the security council and had become the de facto resolution .
2 - syria submitted to the american resolution in return for abstaining from the vote . its representative recorded the same reservations contained in the syria draft resolution .
this position appears to have been a compromise , interpreted by diplomatic information as being neither a rejection of the security council resolution , nor an approval .
syria , thus retained the right to object on principle , perhaps even on form , to a resolution that put the arab community on the other side of the syrian stance .
3 - the resolution focuses exclusively on the security issue in respect of events in the palestinian territories , with most of its clauses focusing on providing the security groundwork to coincide with the start of the american envoy to the middle east , retired general anthony zinni 's mission in the region . the vote on it and the achievement of major international support for it aims to ensure the success of the mission of the american envoy by imposing a ceasefire on the palestinian territories - a priority of his mission - in preparation for forcing the two warring factions back to the negotiating table .
syria 's anger thus stems from the passing of a resolution on the palestinian issue that separates it from the arab issue , with all that this means for the requirements of a comprehensive settlement for which syria calls .
4 - the security resolution reflects the import of the saudi crown prince 's initiative , namely to create a security solution to the palestinian question in return for what he viewed as full normalization .
it also reflected the first formulation communicated by american journalist thomas friedman from prince abdallah , not the revised version which , it was recently said , was the product of a meeting between syrian president bashar al-asad and the saudi crown prince for the purpose of imposing the characteristic of a comprehensive settlement on the ideas he had proposed .
these are the guarantees sought by al-asad for conforming to the saudi plan as a mechanism leading to a comprehensive settlement .
the resolution thus returns the solution to its security framework .
but the official lebanese position on the resolution is in line with the syrian point of view , but due to its ambiguity and lack of clarity , lebanon did not appear to be siding with a negative stance towards it when it is in the midst of preparations for an arab summit at the end of this month .
but this has not prevented unofficial discussions among officials to evaluate the resolution , which , according to well - informed official sources , will not necessarily cast its shadow over the arab summit . they also confirm that washington follows reports on the summit on a daily basis through the successive activities of american ambassador vincent patel with some officials . these activities focus in particular on the fringe , unofficial discussions of the summit , in the manner of the recent iraqi move towards lebanon and syria after the two countries were informed by the iraqi delegation of considerable flexibility in dealing with the summit and the results thereof , which it was keen to demonstrate , along with iraq 's desire not to make its problem with kuwait a cause of discord in it .
some lebanese officials believe that the security council resolution aims to achieve a " long - term freeze " of the israeli - palestinian war in an attempt to freeze the intifada without putting forward clear proposals in its political content . they also believe that resolution 1397 is one of those rare resolutions to be issued by the security council , which is characterized by complex ambiguities on the one hand , and by unabashed prejudice in its evaluation of events taking place in the palestinian territories , even in light of the important historical stance that it has adopted , namely acknowledgement of a palestinian state neighboring that of israel .
but an acknowledgement such as this remains fraught with caution , in the opinion of some lebanese officials , in view of the failure to determine the legal framework for the borders of the palestinian state , which is one of the effective axes of the israeli - palestinian conflict and the continuation of the intifada .
and this , they add , is what was expressed by the other clauses in the resolution , of american origin , as equality between the two sides in calling for a ceasefire to be respected , and in terms of attacks and excesses .
anthony zinni will not only cross scorched earth to reach yasir arafat 's headquarters in central ramallah tomorrow - he will also pass over israeli heads so excited that ariel sharon and his minister of defense binyamin ben eliezer are competing against each other to claim responsibility for the crime of storming the political capital of the palestinian authority .
what is almost certain is that zinni 's third mission will not be stable , as it is said , after his first two missions failed .
between the gradual withdrawal from ramallah and the return to the ceasefire lines there is considerable distance , which will not be crossed easily .
here it is necessary to examine in detail the policies of the israeli government , which , since george bush announced that he was sending zinni to the region , has drawn up three options to totally undermine his mission . they are :
first , the negotiations option , represented in sharon implicitly disregarding the talks which started last week between his minister of foreign affairs , shimon perez and chairman of the palestinian legislative chamber , ahmad qurei ( abu ala ) , which ended in failure due to the israeli side repeatedly trying to convince the palestinians to accept the paper previously put forward by peres , which talks of establishing a palestinian state over no more than 42 % of the total area of the west bank , in addition to the gaza strip .
secondly , the military option , represented in a major escalation of the invasions of the camps and occupation of ramallah , which began a few hours after these fringe talks , which are always taking place on the margins of open hostility , failed .
it was clear yesterday that the presence of israeli tanks at the entries to the palestinians presidential compound was merely intended to bring out sharon 's " response " to zinni 's mission via the ceasefire , albeit within al-manarah square and in the heart of ramallah , in addition to portraying sharon 's " positive attitude " by means of his call for a gradual withdrawal from the town and redeployment at the entrances thereto .
this is sufficient to ensure that the elements for an explosion remain , especially if we recall that the ceasefire is supposed to take us back immediately at least to the points established when the tenet paper was drawn up .
thirdly , a geographical option , which can destroy any talks from the outset when they resume , if , that is , the american efforts by means of zinni or anyone else , succeed in bringing the two parties back to the negotiating table .
this option is represented in the agreement of the smaller israeli security government , which comprises seven ministers , yesterday to the plan to " protect jerusalem " by establishing security zones , to include various settlements , notably in ghaifat zaif and maali adumim in the suburbs of the holy city .
in addition to this , reports talks of security measures and defensive arrangements , such as the digging of trenches and the erection of fences and control towers along 54 km from the north , east and south . this means that jerusalem will have a reality imposed upon it , one that is sufficient to destroy any future talks dealing with the basic demand to make east jerusalem the capital of the palestinian state .
in light of all of this we do not know what the objective elements that can help zinni in his missions are . the explicit criticisms directed by george bush yesterday evening for the first time against " the bloody israeli military operations , which do not help provide conditions for peace " are not sufficient to force sharon to respond to the conditions in the field necessary for a ceasefire . similarly , the security council resolution , which provides for the establishment of " the palestinian state " for the first time , cannot constitute an incentive to push the israeli government to put an end to the plans to destroy the palestinian authority . the opposite is , in fact , the case .
on this basis sharon is weighing up his positions on the basis of his understanding of the imperatives confronting american policy in the middle east specifically at the present time . these imperatives have required , first of all , that zinni be returned to the region contrary to everything that was previously said , namely that he would not return before an end to the violence ; and secondly , the passing of the surprise 1397 resolution by the security council , which descended like a crane working on two lines : that of zinni and that of dick cheney .
perhaps the historical difference is represented in the political and psychological links between cheney 's mission and that of zinni . whilst the former promotes the war against iraq , the second puts forward peace in palestine . but the reality is that this " peace " is only needed to the extent that it allows the arab countries to turn a blind eye to the strike against iraq !
of course , bush denies this , as does cheney . but the arab region is lost in the maze , which makes the calls for peace no more than the drumbeats for war .
the best way for the arab summit to start its business would be to send a bouquet of thanks to the international security council .
there would be no harm if the thanks were accompanied by congratulations for the courageous step . perhaps the council might complete the favor , complete the step and declare a palestinian state .
in a day , a month , a year . ..
the important thing is that the resolution issued was accompanied by written recognition , albeit after a collective wail that has continued for half a century , after wars , setbacks , disasters , after a flood of blood , sacrifices and victims .
it is true that many resolutions have been issued by the same security council and that they have remained ink on paper for a long time .
but they were all waiting this resolution , which paves the wave for them .
in any case the ink in which these resolutions are written is indelible no matter how great the passage of time , because this ink is international , not made in china .
and the signatories thereto represent countries on this earth , not mars .
in brief , the international community has done what duty required of it in respect of the crisis of all crises , albeit belatedly .
even if the american vision was delayed until w reached the white house .
and now the ball , with all the rights and obligations this entails , is in the court of the arab community and everyone , here , overseas and across the continents , is listening .
to be specific , they have shifted to the meetings hall of the beirut summit , which is supposed to review the agenda , give a better greeting than the one it received and say to the american president , " this is my vision . "
the resolution is not free from holes , flaws and gaps .
but its importance lies in the fact that it puts palestinian affairs in the hands of a state , which it , its entity , its security and its legitimacy are recognized , even before its is established and declared .
the details are not left in the hands of the devil this time , but are postponed until the fires have been put out , the wounds bandaged , the ruins rebuilt and the specter of death lifted from the skies above gaza and the west bank .
the people of the cave , who were not woken by the vision of prince abdallah and that of george bush , may wake up to the beating of the drum at the vision of the international security council .
so tether your camel and put your trust in god . . . and pray that behind the " positive " resolution of the security council there does not lie a " negative " resolution against . . . who ! ?
israel yesterday claimed that the armed men who carried out tuesday 's attack near the shalomi settlement in upper galilee , northern israel , entered from lebanon and succeeded in crossing the border fence using an arch - shaped ladder .
the israeli army was not at first certain of the point from which the attack was mounted , especially given that the electrified fence along the border with lebanon had not been damaged . the identity of the perpetrators , who were killed in an attack that went on for 40 minutes with police and army forces , supported by helicopters , was not known .
but one of the commanders of the northern area in israel , brigadier meir kalivi , said at a press conference in the border village of biranit that israeli soldiers had combed the borders after the attack and uncovered the point where the two fighters crossed the fence using a ladder , entering israel at least one day prior to the attack .
he explained that the ladder was arch - shaped , which allowed the armed men not to touch the sensitive fence .
he added , " there are certain gaps in the technology available to us " , adding that four of those who had aided the attackers had concealed the ladders under bushes on the israeli side of the borders . "
israeli radio broadcast that it had discovered the ladders near the hanita kibbutz , but another military source said that they had been discovered 150 meters north of the kibbutz border in an area controlled by unifil , the international force operating in lebanon .
israeli security sources reported that the armed men had planned meticulously for the attack and had hidden in the middle of crops on a strategic hill , from where they opened fire on cars passing along the road , which is near to the borders between the shalomi and mistiba settlements , 4 km inside israeli territory .
they said that the armed men were equipped with good weapons .
iran lirman , a former senior office in israeli military intelligence , believed that the armed men had entered israel more than one day prior to the attack , which raises the possibility of israeli arabs providing a refuge for them .
he said , " there is an increasing danger that hizbollah will try to use the northern area to force itself on the conflict with the palestinians . "
he added that israel would try to bring to bear intensive international pressures on syria to remind it that it was " playing with fire " and that if this method failed or hizbollah carried out more cross - border attacks , the hebrew state might give a military response .
israeli defense minister binyamin ben eliezer told israeli television 's channel 1 that hizbollah had demonstrated intent to escalate the situation on the northern borders .
israeli transport minister ephraim sneh pointed out that even were hizbollah responsible for the attack , israel had no interest in opening a second front in the north .
israeli foreign minister shimon perez said that he had asked american secretary of state colin powell and united nations secretary - general kofi anan to put pressure on syria and iran to put a stop to hizbollah attacks .
* in beirut , hizbollah secretary - general mr. hasan nasrallah said on the occasion of the first nights of the month of muharram , " everything of which israel accuses us , whether it is true or otherwise , whether it is proven or not , whether it is real or otherwise , everything of which it accuses us in supporting and standing beside our people in palestine is a great honor for us , for hizbollah and for everyone who stands beside hizbollah . it is a great honor of which we are proud . "
he confirmed , " all the usual threats and browbeating that we hear today , or that we may hear tomorrow or the day after , does not scare or frighten us , nor will it stop us from carrying out our duty and bearing the responsibility .
we are not children of the day .
we are the children of all this history , culture , heritage and thought .
we are the children of this school , its courage and wisdom .
we are not afraid . we will not hesitate once or twice . we are ready to confront anything the israelis can think of .
we are ready , prepared and present in the fields . they will find us as they have always found us . "
he believed , " the war declared today is a war on the quran and the basis of religion . "
when the battle becomes one of defense for the basis of religion and for the basis of the existence of islam , there is no need to look for the number of friends , the number of aides , what we have , what we don 't have , or the like . "

american vice president dick cheney yesterday secured sanaa 's support for washington 's efforts to prevent yemen from becoming " another afghanistan " and to prevent forces from the fundamentalist al-qaeda organization , which is headed by the principal suspect in the 11 september attacks on the united states , osama bin ladin , from regrouping in the country .
but one of the advisors to yemeni president ali abdallah salih said that yemen had informed cheney that it would oppose any american military action against iraq , fearing that it would wreck regional stability .
the yemeni press agency ( saba ) quoted ali salih as saying , " yemen will continue to make efforts with the brothers in iraq for acceptance of the return of the international inspectors within the framework of the resolutions of international law , with which iraq has stressed its compliance and which will ensure the security , stability and integrity of iraq and prevent intervention in its internal affairs . "
the president 's advisor told journalists , " we do not want to pour more oil on the fire (...) we want to settle the palestinian issue . "
in a joint press conference , ali salih described his talks with the american vice president as " fruitful and beneficial " .
he said , " the discussion dealt with many bilateral issues , including cooperation to counter terrorism , the arab - israeli conflict , the genocide to which the palestinian people are subject at the hands of the israeli government , the situation in iraq and the implementation of the resolutions of international law . "
cheney said , " we discussed a wide range of issues , including the palestinian - israeli conflict , the present war on terror (...) and iraq . "
yemeni officials announced that washington would send about 100 military advisors in three waves to train yemeni security forces as part of an agreement reached by the two sides earlier this month .
the port of aden witnessed an attack on the american destroyer the uss cole in october 2000 , which led to the deaths of 17 american seamen . washington held bin ladin responsible for the attack .
washington fears that al-qaeda fighters fleeing afghanistan may head for the remote mountains of yemen .

deputy faris buiz called on the chairman of the palestinian authority , yasir arafat , " not to leave palestinian territory and the intifada because israeli prime minister ariel sharon will not permit him to return " .
in an interview with the central news agency , buiz commented on the convening of the arab summit . he said , " arab summits do not usually give us historical , great or exceptional achievements , especially given that this summit will be held in exceptional , if not highly pressurized , circumstances for the arab situation .
it is being convened when there are foreign armies , such as the american army , on arab territory , and this presence must be reflected in the policies of these states and their political economic and other resolutions .
the summit is being held in the wake of 11 september as the united states mounts a war in which it has confused terrorism , in respect of which we concur with the view that it must be fought , with the rights of peoples to resist foreign military occupation of their territories .
this summit will , furthermore , take place at a time of battles and resistance mounted by the intifada on the domestic front , which represents the fundamental turning point for the arab - israeli conflict .
consequently , we ask this summit to take resolutions based on forbearance , i . e . resolutions that respect the martyrs who fall and that respect the fundamental turning point realized by the intifada following the lebanese resistance , meaning that they should not treat arab rights lightly nor weaken the arab will to restore its rights in full . "
he asked " arafat not to leave palestinian territory , nor the intifada , because i am certain that sharon will not allow him to return . what is happening at the moment is that a trap is being laid for arafat , to isolate him from the domestic intifada . he cannot take a risk in this matter , especially when his presence at the arab summit will not change anything in its resolutions .
the reasonable or modest resolutions that the summit can take will be taken whether he attends or not , whilst his absence from palestinian territory may weaken the intifada , and may isolate him from his people and territory , which we do not want and nor can we accept . "
concerning the initiative made by saudi crown prince abdallah , he said , " there can be no doubting the patriotism , nationalism or arabism of his highness , prince abdallah , but they manner in which he expressed this proposal , in the media or the press , appears somewhat ambiguous .
by which i mean that we believe that the cards governing and determining the nature of post - peace relations should be in the hands of the arab negotiator , especially those countries that are in the vanguard , which are still demanding their rights . the other arab states should support those in the vanguard because they are concerned in the first instance with the arab - israeli conflict but are not demanding direct rights . any proposal made now takes this card out of the hands of those vanguard or the arab negotiator and weakens their position . "
he called for " this card to be kept in the hands of syria , palestine and lebanon . it should not be played other than in the context of serious negotiations , accompanied by a bare minimum of guarantees " .
he said , " any arab proposal must be precise because we have suffered greatly from the ambiguity of some resolutions and the efforts of israel and the west to interpret them that have accompanied this ambiguity , both in connection with the text of resolutions 242 and 338 on occupied arab territories or the occupied arab territories , the translation of these texts , or the general expressions that have left the war open for various interpretations .
i believe that any proposal on this matter must include clear expressions ; for example , defining the extent of the israeli withdrawal from the golan to the 1976 borders . the process of putting forward this matter cannot ignore the palestinian right of return , at least to their liberated homeland of palestine .
finally , i believe that this matter can also not ignore the rights of lebanon . it must also , in the first instance , be precise in the matter of the establishment of a complete palestinian state , sovereign over the territory of the west bank , the gaza strip and also jerusalem . "
the executive council of the maronite association has called on the government " to intensify its efforts and take note of the spreading tension close to the lebanese borders with israel " . it hoped , " it will not give any new pretext for lebanon to be swamped by a new cycle of pressures that will increase its sufferings . "
the council held a meeting chaired by president of the association haris shihab and issued a statement , which said , " the executive council of the association dedicated an important part of its meeting to examining the stages through which the appeal submitted by the association in connection with the mass naturalization decree issued in 1994 has passed . to this end it listened to the lawyers deputy nimatallah abi nasr and hafiz zukhur , who , along with lawyer antwan aql , reviewed the appeal brought by the maronite association against the decree at the state consultative council .
several years have passed since the review without a ruling being issued . only two years remain for naturalized persons to acquire full political and civil rights .
the council thanked the lawyers who provided the review for their efforts in pursuing the matter , and reiterated its demand that the naturalization decree , which contains fundamental legal flaws , be overturned . it also expressed surprise that his excellency minister of justice samir al-jisr should have stated some days earlier in response to a question that be believed that the state consultative council would not nullify the decree in respect of which the appeal had been brought because it did not usually do so .
minister al-jisr had previously demanded that the practice of turning cases that were still before the courts into a media contest be stopped , in order to maintain the independence of the judiciary and keep it far from political attractions .
the executive council expressed surprise at these two contradictory positions and rejected the notion that the minister could declare lawful for himself that which he prohibited from others , thereby trying to beat the court 's judgment , if not trying to guess it .
the council believes that it is a duty to preserve its independence , so that it will remain a refuge and authority for all citizens and anyone with a righteous demand .
meanwhile , the council urged the government to increase its efforts and take note of the spreading tension close to the lebanese borders with israel .
as the arab summit is about to get underway , the lebanese government has a number of hot political , economic , financial and social issues , the treatment of each requiring that much is done . it does not need a new , complex issue that it will not be able to deal with because it does not have many cards . it hopes that it would not give any new pretext for lebanon to be swamped by a new cycle of pressures , which would increase its sufferings . "
the council previously met with president of the mar mansur association in lebanon , albert al-zughbi , and members of its administration . they gave a presentation on the activities of the association across lebanon in the areas of social assistance and secondary , nursery and vocational education . it praised the efforts made by the association in the service of the needy and agreement was reached to unify efforts to integrate the work of private social organizations , in order to firmly establish social solidarity to confront the difficult living conditions sweeping through the country . "
the emigrants abroad association has criticized the actions of " civil servants in the administration of the ministry of foreign affairs " for initiating " an open war on the association " .
it called on president emil lahud , speaker nabih birri and prime minister rafiq al-hariri , " to put an end to the interference by civil servant haitham jumaah in the affairs of the association " .
an official from the association stated , " the world lebanese cultural association , legal representative of lebanese emigration , supports and continues to support lebanese institutions irrespective of the political and party trends of those in government and the government .
the legitimate leadership of the association , elected during the mexico conference held in may 2001 , has translated this position with a series of visits to lebanon and by contacts made during last summer . statements and announcements made by the president of the association , basharah basharah , confirm this commitment and the commitment to lasting open dialogue with the institutions of the lebanese state . the leadership of the association strongly rejects , however , the actions of some civil servants in the administration of the ministry of foreign affairs , especially civil servant haitham jumaah , director of the emigrants directorate , who has opened an illegal war on the association by summoning emigrants and appointing them to non - existent responsibilities in the branches of the association . he has tried to impose some officials on the continental council of the association in australia , an act that is rejected and not recognized .
we confirm some emigrant , particularly australian - lebanese facts , as follows :
1 - the lebanese community in australia numbers about half a million citizens . its leaders have distinguished themselves by their pioneering role in the foreign country and in strengthening lebanese - australian ties .
this community is fully aware of their pioneering role and the independence of their decision in order to preserve relations between the two peoples and reject exploitation of their abilities in issues other than their sacred and patriotic issue .
2 - the continental council for australia and new zealand is a fundamental part of the international council of the association . it undertakes to continue in the struggle for the lebanese cause and for organizational solidarity with the decisions and recommendations of the mexico conference . it is surprised by the actions of some officials at the ministry of foreign affairs in respect of the association and the australian continental council .
3 - we are completely astonished at how an official from one of the government 's ministries can act to spread division in the emigrant ranks by appointing illegitimate representatives of the association in australia , when there already exists an elected , legitimate leadership .
we call on the government , at the head of which stand brigadier emil lahud and messrs . nabih birri and rafiq al-hariri , to put an end to the interference by civil servant jumaah in the affairs of the association .
4 - we have been informed by the continental council , entrusted with the legitimacy of the association , that it has renewed its invitation to all lebanese in australia to join the association , via its branches in all continents and countries , at a regional conference to be held soon , for leadership elections and to discuss ways of strengthening the situation of the community .
we call on all those loyal to take part in this conference in order to unite ranks , make progress and flourish . "

at the end of the session , minister of information ghazi al-aridi announced the following official decisions :
president of the republic emil lahud described resolution 1397 issued by the security council the day before yesterday as " ambiguous and concerned with generalities ; it was not linked nor made reference to previous resolutions issued by the security council " .
he noted , " the lack of clarity in international resolutions has , in the past , led to confusion in the interpretation and a debate that is still on - going . the new resolution will add to the debate because it can be interpreted in more than one way , and it does not distinguish between israel the occupier and israel the aggressor .
maronite patriarch cardinal mari nasrallah butrus safir yesterday met in bakarki with the secretary - general of the " international alliance for justice " , bakhtiyar amin , who was accompanied by mrs safiyyah talib al-suhail . they discussed with him human rights in iraq and the suffering of the iraqi people at home and abroad .
he then met with former director of the central immigrants fund , shadi musaad , who thanked him for sending a representative to the occasion held in his honor at the al-antoni institute in baabda .
bakarki 's visitors included the director general of the maronite sisters of mary abbot francois eid and messrs . fuad makhzumi and kamil duri shamun .
former american president bill clinton stressed , " the establishment of palestinian and israeli states was necessary to bring about peace and guarantee security and prosperity in the region " . he criticized the manner in which the american envoy to the middle east , general anthony zinni was working and commended the initiative put forward by saudi crown prince abdallah to resolve the arab - israeli conflict .
written by halah humusi :
the syrian position in harj tabit was out of reach and beyond a stone 's throw .
the fierceness of their voices reached it and , free from obstacles , cut across the small distance that they were prevented from crossing .
" come on , get out syria " , " the only army we want in lebanon is the syrian army " , " freedom , sovereignty and independence " , " god , lebanon and aun - and no one else " .
they shouted like that in loud voices within earshot of tens of cadres from the internal security forces , the army and the intelligence services , who surrounded them and prevented them from progressing further .
they did not calm down until after they had delivered their message : " we reject syrian hegemony over lebanon .
the syrians must leave our country alone . "

written by radwan aqil :
the participation of the official spokesman for the orthodox church in jerusalem , father atallah hanna , at the opening of the workings of the " arab conference " in support of the intifada held in beirut had a significant impact on the hearts of participants . this was on account of the speech he gave to conference delegates , in which he expressed the pain and daily sufferings of the palestinians , in addition to the place he occupied as a representative of christians and muslims and the fact that he spoke boldly and patriotically .
the israeli authorities tried to prevent him from participating in the conference and placed a number of obstacles in his path . but he eventually arrived in beirut , which he is visiting for the second time .
it has been decided that he will meet maronite patriarch cardinal mar nasrallah butrus safir in bakarki this morning to communicate to him the concerns of the palestinians and the state of churches in the holy land .

an order from the internal security forces stipulated that all banners set up in the streets for the convening of the summit should be removed .

"
in a statement yesterday he said , " the organization has done well given that the defense of students rights and freedoms is not limited to this organization .
i would like to say that the students are our brothers and children . we previously stood beside them and defended them , notably when they were subject to violations near the palace of justice and when the campus of the faculty of engineering was stormed at st joseph university .
at the time we said that these are the future of lebanon and that we must establish a dialogue with them , not resort to the means of suppression , pressures and terror . today we advise our fellow students to look to the higher interest of the country , especially in these delicate circumstances .

asked about what washington expected from the beirut summit , he said , " we hope for a solid and coordinated arab stance , certainly on the issue of peace in the middle east . "

general ( tony ) zinni is known to be arriving in the region . american vice president dick cheney will continue his tour in the arab world .
these initiatives , in addition to those undertake by the arab side , are positive . i believe that the aim of any side is peace and negotiation .

written by khalil falihan :
well - informed sources report that the visit of vice chairman of the iraqi revolutionary command council izzat ibrahim and foreign minister naji sabri al-hadithi to beirut provoked much curiosity on the part of american ambassador vincent patel , who asked officials as to the aims of the visit of the senior iraqi delegation . he was told that it formed part of the preparations for the summit .
when he expressed surprise that ibrahim headed the delegation he was told that he was representing saddam hussein at the beirut summit , and that king fahd had previously sent a special representative to confirm saudi participation .
they noted that the " the situation between iraq and kuwait " was missing from the summit agenda , the headings of which were decided in cairo last monday . the agenda of the 117th meeting of arab foreign ministers was also missing .
they revealed that the other question raised by patel focused on whether lebanon had taken a decision to sign the free market agreement with iraq . he was told that this would take place after the summit .
when he asked about the nature of this agreement , he was told that it came under the security council " oil for food " resolution and that it had previously been signed by syria , egypt , jordan , tunisia and yemen .
in addition , the iraqis have preferred lebanese products since before the war .
patel asked about the circumstances surrounding the operation at the shalomi settlement , in connection with which the israeli forces are still trying to accuse hizbollah of being responsible , either with the help of palestinians with whom they trained or by using elements that succeeded in penetrating the international borders .
he was told that no shots were fired from lebanese territory towards israel , as had been confirmed by the command of the international force and by security and party officials . even israeli investigators had rejected the story of any fighters being launched from lebanese territory .
they mentioned that patel also asked about lebanon 's position on security council resolution 1397 . lebanon 's observations on this resolution included the following :
1 - the resolution made no reference to the israeli occupation .
2 - it merely referred to security council resolutions 242 and 338 , without affirming their implementation .
3 - it referred to an area containing the israeli and palestinian states , but failed to specify their location or their capitals .
4 - it made no reference to palestinian refugees , nor general assembly resolution 194 .
5 - it only referred to the efforts of saudi crown prince abdallah without speaking clearly about them in order that they be adopted or a mechanism created for them .
6 - the resolution dealt with the two states of israel and palestine and therefore was not comprehensive .
they confirmed no party had as of yesterday asked lebanon to support this resolution and they believed that the fate of this resolution would be similar to other resolutions issued by the security council , namely that it would not be implemented .
resolution 425 has not been implemented in full . lebanese prisoners in israeli prisoners have not been freed and refugees have not returned to their home . the penetration of the blue line by air and land had not stopped and most of the fields of land mines were still intact .
they noted that resolution 1397 was put before the council and passed in 14 minutes .
this means that the resolution was cooked up outside the council and was submitted only for approval , not debate .
the draft prepared by the arab community had been cast aside because it referred to the israeli occupation and the importance of establishing a palestinian state with jerusalem as its capital .
they believed that the import and essence of the resolution were to implement the tenet plan and the mitchell report .
they described it as " timid " .
deputy chairman of the supreme islamic shiite council sheikh abd al-amir qablan believed that the new hijri year was " the year of the intifada " . he thought , " what is required is fidelity to the arab right in palestine and rejection of all formulations that people want to promote to solve the palestinian issue . "
in an address given on the occasion of the new hijri year and the beginning of ashura he said , " the anniversary of the prophet 's noble hijra calls to mind the noblest of divine meanings concerning the courageous and heroic stances adopted by the prophet of god ( s ) and his refusal to submit to the quraish , when he said ' by god , if they put the sun in my right and the moon in my left for me to leave this affair , i would not have done so . ..'."
the anniversary of the noble flight reminds us of the sacrifices of the first fedayeen in islam , imam ali bin abi talib ( a ) , who sacrificed himself for the prophet of god and slept in his bed , embodying the most sublime signs of courage and altruism .
this anniversary brings back to us the glories of islam , the day when imam ali bin abi talib ( a ) confronted marhaba the jew and wrestled with him on the day khaibar was conquered and the jews were expelled from it .
on the occasion of this new year , the anniversary begins of the ashura retinues , by which imam al-hussein ( a ) fled to god , may he be praised , following the examples of his grandfather and father in sacrifice , altruism and jihad . thus was the revolution of imam al-hussein ( a ) an extension of the jihad of his grandfather , the seal of the prophets . this was expressed by the prophet of god in his words : hussein is of me and i am of him .
an examination of the meanings of the prophet 's flight requires us to flee to god as the prophet of god did . this requires us to leave behind sins and bad deeds , to renew the relationship with god , may he be praised , and to make what pleases him , may he be glorified , our criteria in our actions , deeds and behavior , so that we flee from our desires and instincts , call ourselves to account and turn in humility and sincerity to the broad mercy of god . .."
he added , " the noble flight of the prophet has established the most sublime meanings and lessons because this day celebrates the establishment of fraternity in faith on the day the prophet of god made brothers out of the muhajirin and the ansar . this fraternity was an example , one that we should follow in view of the meanings of love , cooperation and solidarity that it contains in line with the concepts of the faith . this requires muslims and arabs to embody this fraternity in arab and islamic solidarity of action and close cooperation in order to confront the challenges of the new world order and the hegemony of the forces of arrogance over most areas of the world .
this fraternity forms a sound basis and provides strong armor for confronting the challenges of economic , political and cultural globalization , and requires us to strengthen the spirit of citizenship in our arab and islamic countries , to develop the ties of arab and islamic solidarity , and to develop accommodating relations between the arab and islamic states , so that we will be one force to counter the projects of hegemony and control imposed upon us by the events of 11 september . the call of the hijra invites us to unite , to demonstrate solidarity and to reject all forms of oppression and tyranny , to confront it with the self - sacrificing spirit of hussein , one that accepts neither humiliation nor shame and draws its strength from the determination , patience and jihad of the prophet of god ( s ) and his rejection of deals and concessions .
the message of the hijra and ashura requires us to support our brothers in palestine and to provide all that they require to stand fast and to support the confrontation with the renewed zionist terrorism against their villages , towns and homes . one cannot stand by and watch as a spectator the massacres and attacks against people , to which the palestinians are subject without limitation .
this blessed hijri year is the year of the intifada when our sons flee to god in their fight against the occupation , and , just as god promised victory , the intifada will bring victory , pride and liberation , if god permits .
the people of palestine , by means of the blessed intifada against the zionists , embody the spirit of jihad , which will certainly lead to victory . this spirit is what we need today at the level of our nation , our peoples and our states .
given this , what is required is fidelity to the arab right in palestine and rejection of all formulations by which people want to promote a solution to the palestinian issue , for it is not permissible to concede the right of the palestinian people in their land , the land of palestine , which includes jerusalem , representing the capital of the palestinian state , and which will be achieved by the return of palestinian refugees to their homes and by the destruction of all zionist colonies in the west bank and gaza strip .
the anniversary of the prophet 's flight calls us to learn from it the meanings of patience , determination and struggle . the anniversary of ashura calls us to the greater and lesser jihad , to combat corruption and perversion , to triumph over ourselves , to consolidate our national unity , to deepen our arab and islamic solidarity , to give in a spirit of altruism and to sacrifice in public and personal matters . "
kamal junbalat was asking his fellow deputies in the national struggle front : how do you legislate ?
and for whose interest do you legislate ?
in the midst of this complete confusion of weird and wonderful , and occasionally astonishing , legislation , statements and speeches , the enlightened observer can not avoid seeing them as an advanced attempt to wipe out people 's memory , to destroy and impoverish them , whilst those who do not even have average knowledge or intelligence play and twist words and wires .
in the context of his defense of the draft law to lift protection from commercial monopoly agencies , one of these incisive minds asked : if the state has decided to abandon its own monopolies , how can we protect the monopolies of the major merchants ?
our friend forgets , or feigns forgetfulness , that the institutions of state , or the public sector as they are called , are not a state monopoly : they are the winnings gained by the lebanese people through its struggle and sacrifices .
we would like recall here , by way of example not exhaustively , that reclaiming the concession of the beirut electricity company in 1954 required a struggle and popular movements , including demonstrations , detentions and non - payment , which was confronted by the government at that time , which issued a detention order against the popular deputy of beirut and member of the national socialist front , the late abdallah al-hajj , on charges of inciting civil unrest , forcing him to live inside the chamber of deputies for at least one week , during which time the demonstrations increased , the government acquiesced and a decree was issued reclaiming the concession .
the example of electricity sector also applies to the water utilities , which were all private companies . in the movements and demonstrations of apple and tobacco growers , which were mounted to ensure that their demands and just cause won through , perhaps the most notable being the large popular demonstration that took place in beirut during the first half of the 1970s , which was led by kamal junbalat leaning on his stick because of pain his in his leg .
this struggle was crowned by the reclaiming of the concession of the tobacco and persian tobacco , which became one of the institutions of the public sector . it generates profits just as the public telephone department , which has brought in considerable profit for the public exchequer , does .
yesterday , after the leader of the progressive socialist party , walid junbalat , announced in a televised interview that he supported retaining the public sector and its institutions , people had the right to ask : how did this government , which includes ministers who belong to the " democratic forum " , in the council of ministers , agree to the draft privatization law , i . e . to sell the institutions of the public sector , including electricity , water , telephone , ports , the airport , tobacco and others ?
the people also have the right to ask : how did they agree , and in the council of ministers as well , to the draft rent law , which strips tenants of all his basic rights : the right to extend the rent contract and the right to obtain fair compensation to help him secure alternative accommodation .
bearing in mind that they have paid and continue to pay to those who have occupied other people 's houses in beirut and elsewhere compensation far beyond the sums paid to migrant citizens whose homes were destroyed .
what kind of legislation is this , and what logic or justice do we read , sea and hear ?
and how ?
and how ?
and how ?
especially in the area of imposing indirect taxes , which affect ordinary people , the rate of which has increased to 50 % in a year and some months ! ?
and if they are to sell the public sector institutions tomorrow , as they are proud to do and make statements and plan , what will remain of the state and what will it have left ?
the security organizations of whose excesses they complain will remain , as will the taxes of al-sinyurah to which there is no end and the debts of al-hariri which have now reached thirty billion american dollars . some of them may return to the saying that was put forward before the events of 1975 : " security before bread " . it is as if they have not yet learnt that when people 's basic food supplies are threatened , there can be no security for anyone , not before nor afterwards .

on the 25th anniversary of his glorious martyrdom ( 16 march 1977 ) , if kamal junbalat , who made the main slogan of his party 's charter on the day it was declared in may 1949 " a free citizen , a happy people " , could return , he would express the spirit of the charter in these terms : " all of society 's institutions , both government and private are barren or fertile , made sacred or the object of insinuations to the extent that they serve or do not serve mankind . " were he able to return he would have raised his voice in their faces in fierce reproach and asked : what have you done and what are you doing to " the free citizen and the happy people " in this country , at once large and small ?
what have you done to mankind in lebanon after transforming most of society 's institutions into caves for ali baba and his myrmidons , temples for money - changes and those after money however and by whatever means they can find ?

the second matter discussed concerned activating the role of the public environmental prosecutor , which , having reviewed the reports , felt that it was essential that the work of the public environmental prosecutor in the governorate of al-nabatiyyah should be effective , bearing in mind that we are following the environmental efforts . in light of this meeting , a meeting will be held between the municipalities , village leaders and the public environmental prosecutor for them to inform him of any environmental violations or any reckless actions in respect of the environment in the governorate .

a meeting of solidarity with the palestinian people was held at beirut arab university , at the invitation of student and youth forces , during which banners were raised calling for support for the intifada and condemning the massacres .

in sidon students from the al-iman schools , which come under the al-maqasid islamic charitable association , performed prayers for the absent for the souls of intifada martyrs .
students from the french department in the faculty of law at the lebanese university held a symbolic protest , stopping for two minutes silence for the souls of the martyrs after the national anthem was played .
speeches were made on the occasion expressing their absolute condemnation of the israeli aggression and support for the steadfastness of the palestinian people .
at the invitation of the " islamic health organization " , health and social associations and organizations held a consultative meeting at the organization 's headquarters in beirut . deputes and prominent persons attended . it considered the " targeting by the israeli army of palestinian doctors , nurses , paramedics , ambulances and health centers " .
speeches were given condemning these practices and recommendations were issued calling for a demonstration on the eve of the arab summit for continued contacts with international health and social institutions to urge them to condemn these practices .
in response to the article written by mr. pierre muawad , which was published in al-nahar the day before yesterday under the title " today , the church mountain , tomorrow , al-mukamil " , the following article was sent to us :
" i began reading your article in nahar on wednesday 13 / 03 / 2002 on page 14 with the phrase : unfortunately we have received a direct report that the so - called tourist resort project is to be implemented in the kafr silwan heights .
it would have been better for you to write that as an environmentalist you had received this report with much happiness , had you bothered to examine the contract signed between kasrawan municipality and the tourist company .
because , had you read this contract , you would have found the precaution that we included with harsh conditions for protection of the environment and that a consultant was appointed to draw up the necessary study on the environmental risks . . . by an international company that will chose the consultant . in addition , an international company has been tasked to supervise the works , with the exception of a specific building on the summit of al-manarah ( 2091m ) , on the same site of the dilapidated building previously operated by lebanon and al-mashriq television , which was destroyed by the israelis .
so be assured that there is no republic of al-batun .
the project that it is intended to implement has been fortified by the conviction of the people of kafr silwan . there will be no defacement , no destructive tools and no sandboxes that will be set up on it , which is also a condition of the contract signed with the company .
this project is from national capital and those responsible for it are known for their patriotism and their capability in the tourism sector .
so , son of al-mukamil , the contract signed between us and the tourist company means you comply with us by preserving the environment , which must begin with your home , your town and your region and from there the awareness will spread to the country , not by extemporizing .
pay attention to what we say : this project will be implemented on private land owned by the company , not on public property .
it will create hundreds of job opportunities and will bring a significant financial return to the town and its people .
it will stop emigration , will strengthen environmental tourism and will make tourism part of the economy in addition to the current agricultural economy , from which the farmers of our town suffer .
this project has not passed through the darkness . it has been though a terrible war waged by people with interests who play with the good resources of our area through the water that they pack and export , and finally sell to foreigners for tens of millions of dollars .
thank you to the minister of the interior and the municipalities , ilyas al-murr , who revitalized this project by submitting it to the council of ministers .
thank you to the council of ministers in its entirety .
thank you to the president of the country for standing on the side of right .
for god 's sake : enough of trying to lay the blame in the name of the environment , my brothers .
i had to meet one of the kings of the east . he told me , ' you are in your new position of vice regent . '
i said to his majesty , ' is the king envious of the vice regent ? '
he answered me saying , ' i would have preferred to be president of the republic . '
the king ( fuad i , father of king faruq , king of egypt at that time ) preferred to be president of the republic because at least he knew when his term was up . "
the new government had nothing this week but the " magical " proposed account which it has decided to open at the bank of lebanon to serve the debt , with the aim of gradually reducing it using the revenue from privatization , mobile telephones , gifts and the assistance that it will obtain at home and abroad .
this proposal was the racehorse in the consultative dialogue that took place yesterday between prime minister rafiq al-hariri and the economic authorities , who always used to be the strategic ally of the government generally , and of prime minister al-hariri specifically .
the distance between the two parties has reached the point of disagreement , due to the fact that prime minister al-hariri has not listened over the last period other than to the domestic calls that hurried him to take decisive action because the time remaining to salvage anything was beginning to run out , because more than one party had him in their sights and because he not only had to save the situation , but also himself , with the least amount of losses possible .
this explains his ignoring the economic authorities , in order to stop them delaying his projects , with the links that were broken to be repaired with something better .
dear colleagues .
exceptional circumstances have prevented me from taking a seat among you and addressing you directly at your second arab conference of its kind since last december 's conference , in which i participated with enthusiasm in defense of the intifada and the resistance .
today , like yesterday , i hope that you will have room in your hearts for words that try to oppose and review that which seems obvious , as was the case with what i tried to exchange with you last winter .
an exchange of views is a necessary condition in the life of our conference and is essential if is to have vitality .
you know , as do i , that our rulers entered into a war last century without ammunition .
you know that they were defeated and stopped thinking about it .
some entered into a peace from a weak and defeated position and transformed themselves into reservists , far removed from the arab - israeli confrontations . others entered into a deceitful peace , one that they did not need , in order to secure the satisfaction of the united states and the west generally .
still others are still standing in the middle . they are unable to fight , but nor can they seek a peace that will maintain dignity .
you , like me , know also that the experience of our rulers in matters of war and peace is no better than their experience in economic matters .
the rich among them do not control their resources and cannot dispose of them in a way that is politically beneficial to the arabs , if they should have the intent to do so . the poor among them need international assistance and are drowning in a sea of debts .
this is how we find them all , with no way to resist international and american pressures on them in particular . their sensitivity to the pressure is heightened by their awareness that most do not rule by the will of the people : they talk in their international meetings about the dangers of a popular revolution against them , about being overthrow , and the need for protection if they go against the will of their people and walk far with the united states and israel .
the price of a can of petrol in the local market rose by 200 lira and the price of a 100 liters of general and industrial fuel oil by two dollars .
the maximum price for sale of liquid fuels delivered to consumers throughout lebanese territory with effect from yesterday was set as follows :
98 octane grade petrol 20,200 lira , 95 octane lead - free petrol 18,000 , 90 octane lead - free petrol 17,800 lira , and gas 7,400 lira .
yesterday the jordanian minister of transport nadir al-dhahabi , accompanied by the director general of jordanian land transport , abdallah al-shawawrah , and the director of land and sea transport at the ministry of transport , abd al-hafiz al-qaisi , visited beirut port . they were met by president and director general of port administration and investment , hasan kamil quraitam .
the conditions of maritime transport and the development of port traffic following preparation and development were discussed .
minister al-dhahabi said afterwards , " we have examined the current situation of beirut port in order to take appropriate decisions on future cooperation between our two countries in relation to sea and land transport . "
the delegation then toured the basins and docks of the port and examined how work was conducted , stopping at the containers station and the free zone .
it went aboard the ms aidah , which was anchored at dock .
the board of directors of the national social security fund is known to have dropped the proposal for the fund to pay an increase to the educational grant for the private sector in its meeting yesterday . this had been agreed between the government and the general workers union with the security fund charged to pay this increase .
the proposal was put to the vote in a previous meeting of the board but it was dropped in part as a result of a boycott by representatives of employers on the board .
when it was resubmitted to the meeting yesterday , in which a number of employer's representatives participated , following suspension of the decision to boycott , it received only 12 votes . it required at least 14 votes .
completing the payment of subsidies allocated to exporters as part of the national program to support agricultural exports , the general organization for encouraging investment , edal , has announced in a statement " the payment of sums due in full for the year 2001 at 10 am next monday " .
this step translates the government's commitment to the support provided to the agricultural sector through the program , in particular as this program has made a large payment to this sector , revived its workers , helped to improve the quality of lebanese products and restore their reputation abroad . "
the organization announced that it was " in the phase of activating the program with the aim of enabling lebanese exporters to increase their exports by opening foreign markets to them " .
to what extent will the government commit itself to act on the slogans it has put out about investment in lebanon ?
it appears that the contradiction between what is announced and what is implemented recently affected a company founded by lebanese emigrants , with the government not missing any opportunity to invite them to transfer some of their investment allocation to the government .
the policy of ignoring the requirements of any investment venture led to a decision to close the company , bearing in mind that the tourist project of which we are speaking cost 90 million dollars and was expected to create about 1200 job opportunities .
a statement issued by the " karuni tourist development company , llc " stated that the board of directors met under the chairmanship of mr. edmund qabshi , immediately on his arrival from venezuela to attend the meeting , and took a provisional decision to close the company in beirut and close the file on the tourist project that was to have been implemented on a piece of real estate in the al-damur plain . "
the statement clarified , " the reason for the closure decision is the lack of clarity in the position of the official and political authorities towards the project , if not the complete absence of a position , despite successive reviews over one and a half years with the relevant authorities . "
the statement said that the initial maps relating to the project , which had been prepared by the most important lebanese and foreign companies , had been submitted to the supreme council for civil planning in order to obtain provisional approval in preparation for completion of the final executive maps for the project , which would have cost about 90 million dollars and execution of which would have lasted 3 years . it would have provided about 1200 job opportunities .
the statement quoted the chairman of the board of directors as saying that he would never invest again in lebanon .
there was no change to the atmospherics of the beirut discount market yesterday against the weak demand for the american dollar and the hesitation of traders to give it up except in rare cases .
the bank of lebanon expanded margin of intervention remained at 1501.00 ( buy ) and 1514.00 ( sell ) , making it close at a nominal average published price of 1507.50 lira , as it has done for the last two and a half years .
at the same time , traders continued to circulate the dollar at the high end of this margin and , occasionally , outside the central bank whenever an offer was made at this price . the market was very quiet and the volume of trading was no more than seven million dollars , part of which was circulated between the banks at a buy and sell price of 1514.00 .
abroad , the dollar remained weak in the face of the other major currencies , negatively affected by the increasing deficit in the american balance of payments , which rose to 98.8 billion dollars during the fourth quarter of last year , compared to 98.5 billion dollars in the third quarter , and recording 417.4 billion dollars over 2001 . this development irritated head of the federal reserve , alan greenspan , who expressed anxiety at the increasing deficit . at the same time , american trade representative robert zulik believed that the strong dollar had become a problem for the united state , increasing its trade , current and payment budget deficits .
in fact this development did hide the reduction in the number of people seeking unemployment benefit in the united state by 3000 last week , leaving a total of 377,000 at the end of the week . this suggests that there are new job opportunities being created as a result of a revival in economic activity . moreover , the american ministry of trade announced that factory stocks did not rise in january more than 0.2 % on december 's levels . at the same time , sales of this stock jumped by 1.1 % over the same period , reflecting an improvement in consumer spending , which is largely due to economic growth .
the dollar was also negatively affected by the announcement made by the national institution for statistics and economic studies that manufacturing production in france rose by 0.9 % last january for the first time since the start of summer 2001 , above expectations . this development revived demand for the euro and pushed it through the 0.88 dollar threshold , especially after the annual report of the european central bank in march revealed that the rate of gross domestic product growth in the euro area would range between 2.00 and 2.50 % this year .
all these reports on both sides of the atlantic helped put pressure on the dollar and forced it to close in london as follows :
- 0.8825 euro against 0.8760 the day before yesterday in new york .
- 1.4210 sterling pounds against 1.4160 .
- 1.6575 swiss franc against 1.6755 .
- 128.90 japanese yen against 129.55 .
- 1.5940 canadian dollar against 1.5945 .
the prices of precious metals fell as a result of investors being inclined to take profits . an ounce of gold closed in london at 290.60 dollar against 293.60 dollars the day before yesterday in new york , having stabilized at 292.70 dollars in the morning and 291.20 dollars thereafter .
similarly , an ounce of silver closed at 4.48 dollars against 4.5170 dollars the day before yesterday in new york , having stabilized in the afternoon at 4.51 dollars .
european stock markets rose hesitantly following a continued fall over several days as a precaution against slow growth in the american economy as the head of the federal reserve had warned .
these feelings were strengthened by the statistical indicators published until now in the united states , on account of the rise in the sales difference or the reduction in the number of those seeking unemployment benefit , which did not reassure investors as to the direction in which the american economy is moving .
the financial times index closed in london down 10.60 points at 5261.40 points . the cac 40 index at the paris stock exchange rose 23.07 to 4546.84 points whilst the extra dax index at the frankfurt stock exchange rose 30.88 points to 5276.87 points .
the direction of the american markets varied according to the variation in expectations about the manner of economic growth . dealers awaiting the quarterly results to be announced by the oracle software company after closing frustrated initiatives on the eve of the publication of important economic date in the united state today , most prominently the figures for industrial production and production prices in february and the index of consumer confidence prepared by the university of michigan in march .
the nasdaq index fell slightly to 1858.00 points as the dow jones industrial index fluctuated between a high of 10551.11 points and a low of 10474.72 points , before recording an average in the evening of 10528.83 points , up 26.98 points on the day before yesterday .
this was preceded in the morning by an improvement in the tokyo stock exchange following two days of falls after rumors that the american wal - mart chain of shops would take a strategic share in the japanese seiyu supermarkets group . this gave the market some confidence and left the nikkei index to close up 153.51 points at 11568.82 points .
the general authority of the economic and social council concluded its two - day meeting ( 12th - 13th of this month ) by incorporating amendments to section 1 of the social security law relating to administrative structure . a committee was formed to formulate proposals that can be incorporated in section 2 , which concerns the retirement system and social protection .
according to council sources , it is expected that a second meeting of the authority will be held at the beginning of next month , in order to ratify the agreed amendments to section 2 .
it is known that the most prominent amendments to the administrative system showed a move towards the old law , with various amendments added to the law approved by the government and submitted to the council , after the articles of the old law were relied upon .
a discussion about the identity of the national social security fund took place , as to whether it was a public institution with a social characteristic , as the government suggested , or an independent institution ?
opinion settled on the view that the fund was an independent institution with a social characteristic .
tax and inspection agency
members of the general authority also agreed to retain the administrative apparatus of the fund as it is , with the exception of an important proposal to reflect a consolidation in the fund 's finance department , with dr ghassan shaluq , member and organizer of the economic committee calling for the establishment of " the general agency for tax and inspection " . a committee was formed to study the proposal .
citing the reasons for such a step , shaluq believed that the issue of tax and inspection represented a cornerstone of the fund 's work . " experience has shown that the traditional method of managing this task has slipped up for several reasons , which had led to a reduction in collection and the continued silence of many organizations and individuals . this can be clearly seen by reading the data available for the number of registered persons , both organizations and individuals , and the amount of subscriptions . "
he noted that the protection systems in a number of developed countries have resorted to establishing a special independent unit for this task .
he cited the french experiment , where the " ursaf " department undertakes this responsibility for the social fund .
he confirmed that ratifying and implementing this proposal would secure an increase , which is estimated to be large , in collection , verification and inspections rates .
the verification rates for social security are known to vary between 40 and 45 % for well - known political , sectarian and administrative reasons .
the proposal for the establishment of " the general agency for tax and inspection " included the following :
" pursuant to the discussion that took place initially in the economic committee and then in the smaller committee to examine the proposed amendments to the social security law , and as part of the attempt to conduct serious reforms of the fundamental issues in the fund , i have the honor to submit the following proposal for the establishment of " the general agency for tax and inspection " , hoping that it will be discussed and ratified by the general authority .
"- article 1 : alongside the departments of the national social security fund there shall be established a new independent department , to be called " the general agency for tax and inspection " .
- article 2 : the agency , for the interest of the fund , shall be responsible for collecting established subscriptions and for inspecting registered organizations and individuals and those who are not registered , for the purpose of legally registering them .
- article 3 : the agency shall come directly under the board of directors of the fund and operate under its supervision .
- article 4 : a special committee , to be proposed by the board of directors and approved by the council of ministers , shall administer the agency . this committee shall comprise representatives of the founding partners in the fund .
the committee shall be chaired by a party representing workers ( or an independent party ) ."
it was also learnt that the amendment has given to the supervisory committee of the fund , which has become the supervisory department , additional powers .
the board of directors demonstrated a determination to elect members from among their organization , and not to leave the matter of election to the council of ministers , which will only select the names of those elected for appointment .
it was also agreed to abolish the proposal to incorporate additional custodianship for the ministry of finance and to retain custodianship with the ministry of work but within the limits of the fund 's independence , in addition to retaining the powers of the director general and the board of directors in a manner that approximates the powers granted to them by the old law .

only love saves .
it gives you your heart .
the true beat .
you know it , and there you are .
new , on a new planet , loving it even
to the last plant on it .
it alone soothes .
without it bitterness and delusion pile up .
when it comes to you , listen to the inner you .
and look at the reflection of your face above .
a page of a great epic . should
you fail to penetrate its mystery , you will have lost
the key to life , you will have lost
the heart .
which has no end . it is not consumed
by daily events , deadlines and chatter .
which
surprises you because you are worthy and know how
to listen and hear it , which is what it came for .
it is never exhausted . it knows that you
are one its tributary streams , so it bestows rain liberally and making flourish
the land and the sky .
which reveals
the secrets , so good overcomes evil and truth
falsehood .
if you open you window and listen
to me this morning : nothing saves but
love .
it was a ceremony to honor the director burj vazlian . the audience was happy in the atmosphere of the occasion and humble in the grave presence of his holiness .
then came his turn to speak and conclude the ceremony with the award .
his appearance remained grave , but his face opened up to another horizon , a broader horizon , as he spoke freely in elegant and stylish french in a patriotic , cultured preaching voice with an unusual admonishing echo .
his holiness said , " do not say that burj vazlian is an armenian artist in lebanon .
say he is a lebanese for an armenian . "
no sooner had this white shock reached me than he continued , " it is one of the first duties of the armenians that they work to make lebanon lebanese . "
why ?
was a supreme religious authority speaking these words in this simple manner , one that penetrated the heart and conscience ?
i have secretly harbored the desire to meet his holiness .
this happened some days later and i discovered that his holiness is an important writer and lecturer in french and english .
just for his holiness , which delighted me , as i heard him talking about lebanon at the burj vazlian evening . he smiled with the gravity of the old and said to them plainly , " what is there to be surprised at if this is the truth ? "
he continued with the same simplicity , " when the armenians left armenia , they found places to stop in the countries of the world , but in lebanon they found a homeland that embraced them .
in those countries they lived and continue to live . in lebanon they settled .
lebanon is a homeland with a special character , an unusual homeland . it is not a country where the armenians have come to live . "
he said , " there are no front lines between lebanon and armenia .
the renaissance of the armenians outside armenia only took place in lebanon .
in every country they found an economy and an infrastructure . but they did not find humanitarian values such as those they found in lebanon , whose values were grafted onto their own . "
he also said , " every armenian learns these words and acts in accordance with them . he knows that his duty is to take part in enriching lebanon's civilization and values and be open to civilizations and cultures so that he does not become isolated and weak .
every armenian should be aware of lebanon's particularities in his surroundings , culturally , historically , morally and spiritually . he should understand that the armenians , following the massacre , achieved their renaissance in lebanon and that they must carry lebanon with them in their hearts wherever they settle , as a cultural bridge between armenia and the countries of the armenian diaspora . "
his holiness said , " we must also preserve this lebanese spiritual and moral ' ethos ' , this lebanese ' essence of existence ' that is unique in its fabric , character and great historical heritage , and this openness which is evidence of strength , noble descent and distinction .
from this point lebanon has entered globalization with its radiant culture and civilization , making it an active player in globalization , not a neutral receiver .
weak countries with no heritage and civilized values fear that globalization will swallow them up . this is not lebanon's situation . "
his holiness concluded with a brilliant truth : " the heart of every armenian strives to preserve the lebanese nature of lebanon , to be an ambassador for the lebanese nature of lebanon in his heart .
he may have fled armenia , its land and sky taken from him , but no one can take what is in his heart .
let his heart contain the history of armenian and the lebanese nature of lebanon , this pure and deep - rooted lebanese nature open to the world , which is as eternal as the cedars of lebanon . "
in the presence of catholicus aram i , i heard things said about lebanon that i had not heard with the same force other than from said aql .
paris - from pierre atallah .
who is the first lebanese press correspondent between france and lebanon ?
a difficult question , and one that requires much research .
but i found the answer via mrs. francoise khuri al-hashim in an old book entitled " the memoirs of francois khuri , former provincial translator to mt lebanon " , beneath which in a thin font it said that he was the correspondent to the al-astrasiyun , independence pledge , journal de caire , havas company in the ottoman period .
the chapters of this book make clear that francois khuri was the first correspondent to work on the beirut - paris line and that he was a pioneer for all arab and foreign correspondents and journalists .
in this book , which is full of information , he wrote his memoirs about " matters of which i hoped to inform the reader and may be of interest for him in connection with the modern history of lebanon " .
these include the disputes between the provincial governor , naum basha , with the people of kafrshima , al-hadath , al-shayah , burj al-barajnah and other locations in the southern and northern plateau ; and the attempt by the french consul du sirsi to reconcile matters between the two parties .
to the conflicts in mt lebanon between the narrow party currents , which caused the country and people much trouble for no clear or obvious reason but were , in most cases , disputes between feudal leaders and families affecting their private interests under the cover of patriotic slogans or concerning the public interest .
khuri recounts his meeting with emil adeh ( before he became president ) in aksan provance , where he was studying law ; and the role undertake by nimr shamun ( father of president kamil shamun ) from his position as chancellor of the exchequer in the mountain government .
in addition to the role of habib basha saad , as head of the board of directors of mt lebanon and the relationship that linked him to nasib junbalat , as well as other points and events ; for example , when the first world war started , the issue of abolishment of the concession that mt lebanon enjoyed in respect of freedoms and self - administrative , in isolation from the other areas of the middle east , which were firmly under ottoman control .
khuri wrote , " jamal basha al-saffah sent a telegraph to the provincial governor asking habib basha al-saad , khalil aql , naum bakhus and francois khuri to come to syria . we complied and went , coming to him at 11 am . it was a friday and we arrived when he was surrounded by the war staff with some deputies (...). in the evening al-saffah jamal basha was alone with saad for about 40 minutes . he told him that the country was entering a new stage and he hoped that he would remain in syria to provide him with his views . al-saad thanked him and said : do you have any objection that i return to my home and at you first signal ?
al-saffah answered : i cannot change a decision that i have taken .
but i will allow you to go and spend christmas period with your family .
present my respects to your wife and tell the patriarch that he must ask for a royal decree for himself and the archbishops . i cannot accept that does not have such a decree (...)."
khuri added , " in syria we were force to see a dreadful , heartbreaking incident - the denouncement of nakhlah mutran , who had been arrested by the ottoman military on charges of treason .
they wanted to teach the people a lesson , so they put him on a cart and force him to remain standing on it .
on his back they placed a piece on paper on which was written the reason for the judgment . the soldier turned him one way and then the other so that the people could read the paper . the people of syria shouted , insulted and spat at him . he fainted when he returned to prison . "
francois khuri 's memoirs contain a chapter on the maronites obtaining the our lady of lebanon cathedral in the fifth district of paris , in which it says : " the maronites had a church in paris in the luxembourg quarter , which was seized from them by monsieur filyar when he was head of the council of elders .
the patriarch asked the french prime minister ciao during his visit to beirut to return the church to the maronites of give them another one . ciao promised to do this .
he fulfilled his promise on returning to france and gave the maronites a church in oleum street , beside which stands lebanon house today ( ...).
according to the book , the people of influence in the mt lebanon province were " three , who interfered in everything (...). they were iskander bek al-tuwaini , head of political affairs in the government of lebanon , khalil bek khuri , head of the arabic department and yusif al-zaghzaghi .
to be fair , i also say that the treasure nimr shamun , father of president kamil shamun , was sympathetic to the government employees and used to loan them their salaries when they approached him for this purpose . for this reason they respected and liked him .
along the lines of the french dictation examination , the le monde newspaper in its weekly middle east edition organized an arabic dictation competition yesterday afternoon at the unesco palace .
the competition forms part of the preparations for the coming arab summit at the end of this month .
the launch of the competition was attended by minister ghaslan salamah , who apologized for not participating as he had to attend a meeting of the council of ministers , but he promised to attend in the advanced stages and at the final stage next april .
colleague lucian george , director of the middle east weekly edition of le monde said that the idea had started in french on the fringe of preparations for the francophone summit , which was postponed until next october .
he said , " we don 't have to ask how a french newspaper is organizing a competition in arabic dictation .
we believe , as does the minister of culture , that there is no difference between languages and cultures no matter how different , because , ultimately , they complement each other . note that the le monde newspaper is only present in lebanon with its special edition for one reason , namely that lebanese citizens are good readers in all languages . "
salamah then spoke and said , " your presence here today is a source of real joy , for me at least , for two reasons : first , as minister of culture , i am delighted to see you sharing in the love of the arabic language and that you are with me in viewing this language also as one of the victims of the destructive war that swept across out country , and we must revive it .
i am very proud at your presence here today and at the presence of those who preceded you in the other governorates . i wanted to take part with you as i did in the french dictation competition ( ...).
secondly , i am delighted as chairman of the supreme organizing committee of the 14th regular arab summit in beirut . in this connection i want to confirm to you that lebanon is a safe , welcoming and cultured country . we did not want this summit to be behind walls but for all lebanese to take part , and for this reason we , along with messrs . lucian george and george farshakh , suggested that we put on this major national competition .
i am pleased to announce to you that bahrain , which is to organize the next regular arab summit , has also asked to us organize a dictation competition next year .
this summit will be an important occasion for us all . i tell you that not one arab country will be absent from it . the level of representation will be high and the number of delegations participating has exceeded all expectations .
before i came to lebanon , we had registered 2240 on the list for members of delegations , and there are nine hundred lebanese , arab and foreign journalists who have registered their names to cover the summit .

the minister said that the five year workshop would be put before the faculty of education . it was " an important and essential national , the success of which would determine the future of lebanon 's generations for many years to come .
if it succeeds in preparing good teachers at all levels of teaching , we will witness a renaissance in government education . "

a tunisian government source said , " at this stage of the investigation there is nothing to justify conclusions other than the initial conclusions of the investigation , namely that the incident was an accidental explosion . "
this came in response to a statement made by german foreign minister otto schily to the german zdf television network late on saturday night to the effect that on the basis of the latest information obtained by the tunisian and german government it was believed that the incident had been planned and was not an accident as the first reports had suggested .
he said , " the last information and indications that i have received from inside the country and abroad increasingly indicate an attack . "
but german chancellor gerhardt schroeder told german television channel 2 that it was not certain whether the explosion was an accident or an attack .
he said , " there are indications that support the hypothesis of an attack , but the reports of the tunisian authorities suggest the opposite . "
he demanded that the circumstances of the explosion be made available as soon as possible .
he added that if it emerged that the explosion was an attack the german government would " exert all its efforts to arrest the perpetrators and put them behind bars " .
giant german travel agents tui announced that it was canceling its program of tours to " all dangerous religious sites " following the djerba explosion .
but it confirmed that it would continue to offer tunisia and djerba island as a tourist destination .
he noted that the german government had not warned german citizens against traveling to tunisia .
leaders of the jewish community in tunisia hoped that the explosion was an accident and not the result of attackers blowing themselves up .
wasifa taraboulsi , a prominent jewish figure in tunisia , stated , " it is impossible that the german minister is correct in his belief on the possibility of the explosion being an attack .
as far as i and my fellow jews and arabs in tunisia are concerned , it is impossible that this should happen here . arabs and jews live in peace here and they cannot even imagine the possibility of this happening here . "

the chief rabbi at the main jewish synagogue in kiev , moshe azman , said that the attackers hit worshippers and destroyed windows at the place of worship in an attack linked to tension in the middle east .
he said that the attack took place on saturday when 50 people entered (...) carrying rocks and shouted , " kill the jews " .
they smashed 20 windows and hit worshippers after prayer (...) i believe that there is a link with what is happening in the middle east " - a reference to the clashes between israel and the palestinians in the west bank .
but ukrainian police denied that the attack was hostile to the jews .
the police spokesman thought it probable that the perpetrators were people returning from a football match .
the jewish synagogue in the center of kiev is one of the oldest sites of jewish worship in the ukrainian capital , where about one hundred thousand jews live . there have been attacks against jewish synagogues , graves and sites across europe since israel launched its military assault on the west bank two weeks ago .
fears of more attacks shortly before the birthday anniversary of nazi leader adolph hitler on the 20th of this april have increased .
madrid - reuters - officials in the spanish police detained an algerian suspected of being a member of the al-qaeda group near the northern town of barcelona .
a police spokesman said : " an algeria was arrested in the town of sant joan despi in connection with the financial wing of the al-qaeda network . "

he announced that the french , german and united states police had cooperated in this operation .
the arrest took place after the spanish authorities seized a number of suspects following the 11 september attacks in washington and new york , including two men suspected of belonging to al-qaeda , who were arrested near barcelona in january .
the spanish government , which holds the presidency of the european union , confirmed that it would not extradite any suspect to the united states if they would face the death penalty .
as demonstrations supporting the palestinians continue in some european countries , it is expected that foreign ministers from the 15 european union member states will , during a meeting being held in luxembourg today , discuss a range of options to bring pressure to bear on israel . they are unlikely to go to the extent of imposing sanctions , such as suspension of the partnership agreement between the two parties that provoked debate recently . they are also expected to express their support for the peace mission undertaken by american secretary of state colin powell as the only hope for ending the violence .

"
he expressed his regret at " the weakness and incapacity of the european union strategy in the middle east " . at the same time he hoped that " this crisis would constitute the start of a mission to formulate a joint european policy on foreign affairs " .
last monday , german chancellor gerhardt schroeder expressed a desire to consider sending an international military force under the aegis of the united nations to the middle east , without dismissing the possibility of german soldiers taking part . however , german defense minister rudolph scharping clarified yesterday in an interview with german television zdf that there were no tangible ideas to send german troops as part of an international peace force in israel .
scharping went on to confirm that the government of his country had temporarily suspended the delivery to israel of military equipment , noting that the delivery of spare parts " had been suspended but not stopped " and that this did not constitute the imposition of a ban .
he added that the german government had by means of this decision wanted to send a " signal " in relation to the present situation .
the belgian government denied the report published by israeli newspaper haartz to the effect that it was considering a trade embargo against israel in protest at its military campaign in the west bank . the spokesman for the belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt stated , " we will not take a unilateral decision . . . agreement must be reached with the other european union member states . "
after the swiss government last week charged defense minister samuel schmid to study all the measures that could reduce military cooperation with israel , the sonntags newspaper published an internal memorandum from the swiss general armaments firm ruag warning of the consequences of the possibility of a reduction in military exchanges with the hebrew state .
the memorandum said , " interference in commercial deals will have a direct effect on the companies concerned , especially the munitions branch of ruag , as stopping ( the exchange with israel ) will have serious consequences for workers . "

the lebanese did not need reminding of the anniversary of 13 april to pile up renewed fears on top of the inherited nightmares .
it has descended upon us with its " good " consequences amidst a regional - lebanese storm , so perhaps the anniversary will coincided with some of its " derivatives " spread over 27 years - the rope is still on the tug - constituting a real alarm bell to those who continue to underestimate and dabble with great danger , which lebanon has again seen in the last few weeks .
the fact is that a tune is emerging from some circles and environs , which it is hoped will justify a security and popular disturbance on the pretext of blind sympathy with the palestinians , when it is targeted sympathy that will ultimately explode palestinian - palestinian differences before aukar square on the domestic front and on the lebanese - israeli borders and the shabaa farms at the same time .
this tune relies deceitfully permitting what is taking place in lebanon on the argument that european capitals are themselves witnessing an unprecedented expression of sympathy with the palestinians .
this is true and very important in terms of the giant stock in hand for the palestinian cause internationally , not to mention the devastating failure of ariel sharon in falsifying the essence of the issue and his inability to make the world submit to the logic of genocide and massacres , and even in terms of the inability of the american administration to drive their own allies to submit to their ambiguous , hesitant and prejudiced policies on the pretexts of 11 september .
but the matter is fundamentally different when some people , thinking themselves to be clever , attempt to impose an international fact on the reality of lebanon , a reality that is critical and filled with factors leading to civil strife , collapse and the war legacies .
the capitals of europe are witnessing popular sympathy with an issue of right . no one is playing with the sympathizers , exploiting the expression or directing it towards an end that will allow war and the opening of a new , mad , free and suicidal front along the lines of what has begun to impose itself on the lebanese situation .
the fact is that aukar square is now the third side of an open hole of explosion , or which will lead lebanon to explode , amidst the frightening disdain shown towards the daily international warnings being directed against it .
there is no difference between targeting the security forces at the hands of " infiltrators " in the demonstrations , and the easy and easiness with which rockets are fired at the borders , and the pre - planned opening of a war front .
all these roads lead to the same end , namely to " prepare " lebanon once more for explosion and disturbance .
they are all tried and tested means with destructive costs , especially when they are accompanied by a turning of the back to international warnings and a dangerous slip towards a deadly international diplomatic isolation , which is the principal cause of the sickness from which lebanon has suffered since it was placed in long - term quarantine .
and purely as a reminder at a time of remembrance : the 13 april disturbances could have been stopped in the act had the army immediately been given a free hand at that time to stop the destruction of he state .
another reminder : the suppression of oppositionists at a time of " popular peace " is deceptively allowed on this pretext . the last seasons of this suppression were last august .
yesterday there was an attack attributed to the security forces . the demonstrations have become absorbed with something else , other than mere solidarity with the palestinian people .
at the borders there are some who are playing with lebanon 's fate and they take their strength from the logic of the state .
some of the " rejectionist " palestinian leaders are running their operations in lebanon from damascus and are urging that the borders be opened .
are not three weeks of this sort of thing enough to appoint " protective security " as arbitrator ? it has previously proven itself , especially in respect of the oppositionists .
haven 't the hotheads read the explicit judicial charge brought against some of those detained , namely that they are subjecting lebanon to the danger of foreign aggression ?
nabil bumunsif .
haartz yesterday observed a reduction in the severity of the bombing seen by the shabaa farms for over two weeks .
it added that the state of full alert was continuing on the northern borders and that the israeli aircraft are intensifying their missions .
it spoke about the visit undertaken by american secretary of state colin powell to the front , where he heard a detailed report from military officers about events over the last two weeks , and about syrian and lebanese involvement in the escalation .
israeli press reports focused yesterday on two key topics : powell 's meetings with israeli officials and his meeting yesterday with head of the palestinian authority yasir arafat ; and the results of the battles that took place some days ago in jenin camp after the israeli army allowed journalists to enter the camp .
in haartz , dani rubenstein wrote an article about arafat 's meeting with powell saying , " the achievement is in the essence of the meeting . " there follows a translation of the key content :
" pessimism prevails over the palestinian leadership as regards the possible results of the meeting of american secretary of state colin powell with head of the palestinian authority yasir arafat .
for the palestinians it is enough that the meeting , which will show to the whole world that arafat is not isolated as the israeli government decided , has taken place (...) the palestinians confessed yesterday that the preparatory meeting that took place last saturday between the american envoy anthony zinni and palestinian representatives saeb uraiqat , muhammad dahlan and muhammad rashid in jericho did not reach any positive results . "
he adds , " the palestinian representatives complain that the american proposals for a ceasefire are ambiguous . the palestinian demands are clearly formulated with a schedule whilst the american demands for israel are always ambiguous and non - binding .
arafat 's declaration of his condemnation of terrorism , which was issued yesterday , was made as soon as the americans sought it .
in return the matter of the israeli withdrawal from area ( a ) contains no clear or binding schedule .
the palestinians also complain that the american demands relating to the start of political negotiations are more ambiguous . "
he continues , " the palestinian leadership is searching for the idea proposed in one of the political meetings , which suggested that arafat leave ramallah for gaza .
most of arafat 's close associates , and even he himself , tend to reject the idea out of hand .
it is true that arafat would , to a large extent , be free in gaza , but those close to him say that he does not feel at present that he is under pressure despite the siege imposed on his office .
the reason for remaining in ramallah is the reports that reach arafat about major international support for the palestinian cause .
he thus no longer feels weak and banished . in fact his strength has increased .
yesterday , a major media battle broke out with regards to what happened in jenin camp , the casaba and nablus once these places were opened to representatives of the media .
arafat and his men are convinced that they will win this battle and so they have no reason to put forward any concessions . "

the united states has given its strongest diplomatic indication of its concern at the situation developing on the lebanese - israeli borders since last march with its secretary of state colin powell suddenly deciding today to mount two quick visits to both beirut and damascus to discuss with lebanese and syrian officials how to contain the escalation on the borders .
following the announcement of the visit first to beirut , american state department spokesman richard boucher confirmed in the evening from jerusalem that powell would stop his talks with israelis and palestinians in order to concentrate on hizbollah operations against israeli forces , who are still occupying the disputed shabaa farms are in southern lebanon .
boucher said , " he ( powell ) will travel to beirut and damascus tomorrow ( today ) to hold talks about another urgent situation , namely the firing across the line drawn by the united nations ( between lebanon and israel ) on israel 's northern border . "
he added that powell would return this evening to jerusalem .
an official lebanese source had previously announced that powell would arrive in lebanon on monday and then travel to syria , two countries that were not originally included on his regional tour .
this step comes following a daily deterioration that has continued for over two weeks in the shabaa farms .
however , this front was completely calm yesterday , for the first time since the artillery and rocket exchange operations began . hizbollah did not mount any attacks against it as it has been doing over the last two weeks .
as of late last night , the agenda for the visit had not yet been finally or officially clarified . it was apparent that security fears had imposed considerable secrecy on the details , to the extent that it was not known whether powell would limit his meetings to one with president of the republic emil lahud at baabda palace , and whether he would also meet speaker of the chamber of deputies nabih birri and prime minister rafiq al-hariri as part of the meeting with lahud , or meet subsequently with each of them separately at the saraya and the chamber of deputies .
the only official information available in this regard indicated that the visit to beirut would not last more than three hours .
and that powell would arrive at beirut airport at 9 am to meet with president lahud at baabda palace at 9:30 or 10 in the presence of foreign minister mahmoud hamud .
the same information indicated that powell would only issue a written statement after the meeting and would not answer journalists ' question .
prime minister al-hariri postponed his trip to the united states , scheduled for yesterday , until today .
he visited damascus where he met with syrian president bashar al-asad and syrian prime minister muhammad mustafa miro .
following his return to beirut in the evening he visited speaker birri .
information suggested it likely that powell will meet each of the three heads of state alone for a short time and then travel to damascus .
this information indicated that powell 's talks would not be limited to the situation on the border , namely just the security aspect , but would also cover the political horizons to settlement in the region . this may have been a fundamental reason for his visit , during which it is expected that the arab peace initiative approved by the beirut summit will be discussed .
official sources said yesterday evening that powell 's visit to beirut had not been included on his tour schedule but had been incorporated in order to ascertain lebanon 's view on the developments taking place in the region , especially the situation in the south , notably in light of the official position expressed by the president of the republic that lebanon could not provide security guarantees for northern israel other than as part of a just and comprehensive peace . the israeli withdrawal from the south was only part of the problem . the most important part - the matter of palestinian refugees - was still suspended .
these sources said that president lahud was " insistent that development in the region could not be separated from their influence on the lebanese arena whenever israeli undertook an attack against the palestinians on the domestic front , which required that the problem of the region be viewed not just in terms of developments in the occupied palestinian territories but in terms of the problem in its entirety , in particular that efforts must be made towards a just and comprehensive peace that would provide solutions and secure the rights and guarantees for all parties to the dispute " .
written by khalil falihan :
senior lebanese sources expressed their satisfaction at what they described as the " american awakening " towards lebanon and syria when american secretary of state colin powell decided that his present tour to the region should include lebanon and syria , after he had informed beirut before it began that it had been excluded from tour . he gave as the reason that his mission was limited to tackling the clashes between the palestinians and israel and the fact that he would meet prime minister rafiq al-hariri , who is visiting washington today , on tuesday . the surprise visit caused al-hariri 's visit , which was scheduled for yesterday , to be delayed in response to powell 's wishes .
it should be borne in mind that american ambassador vincent patel had left beirut on saturday morning to participate in al-hariri 's talks in washington .
they hoped that powell would return to the plan adopted by some of his predecessors who used shuttle diplomacy to tackle the situation in the region and leave behind his policy of caution and fear after american interests in the arab world have come to be fundamentally threatened .
they said that powell had decided to withdraw from his position and to visit beirut and damascus in an attempt by him to prevent further escalation of the situation that had flared up , following the talks undertaken by powell last friday with israeli prime minister ariel sharon and after he inspected the borders with lebanon with to see what was happening his own eyes .
according to an american source accompanying powell , sharon threatened to deliver a harsh blow to lebanon and the syrian forces . the white house was worried at this and he did not want any deterioration in light of the information available to him to the effect that sharon intended to focus his military strike on the new projects built in the south following the israeli withdrawal in may 2000 .
they made clear that powell 's visit , his first to beirut before he travels to damascus , aims to establish calm and prevent any regional deterioration on the lebanese - israeli borders and stop the arab censure of washington for its lack of concern at what is taking place in the south , and for failing to listen to the lebanese view , which stresses that the resistance is mounting its military operations not out of a love of war but to liberate the shabaa farms area , as president of the republic lahud and prime minister rafiq al-hariri will confirm .
they hoped that powell would visit the lebanese borders with israel , as he had done from the other side , to see and hear a lebanese explanation of the reality on the ground .
the sources confirmed that powell 's visit to beirut would be an opportunity to give the arab peace initiative , which was approved by the arab summit by consensus and supported by washington , a push . it will be a priority on the agenda of the talks to be held by the person behind it , saudi crown prince abdallah bin abd al-aziz , who is to visit washington on the 25th of this month , with president george bush .
they though it unlikely that powell would communicate an israeli threat or warning - rather fears of an israeli strike that lebanon could not bear as it experiences dangerous economic conditions .
they noted that powell had decided on this visit to lebanon and syria after having consulted first with the team that is accompanying him and secondly with the white hose , which approved it .
they recounted how powell had asked for an appointment to visit baabda palace today . they said that the deputy assistant to the secretary of state for middle east affairs , david satterfield , contacted the american charges d ' affaires carol kalin and asked her to enquire whether the program of president emil lahud would allow him an appointment today . the response was that an appointment could be made for 9 am .
powell 's office then contacted al-hariri 's home and was told that he was in damascus . he was contacted at his home in damascus but was in a meeting with syrian prime minister mustafa miro . a message was left saying that powell hoped that he could delay his visit to washington a view hours because he wanted to meet with him in beirut and that he was waiting for a response after he had finished his meeting with the head of the palestinian authority , yasir arafat in ramallah . before al-hariri met with syrian president bashar al-asad he informed powell 's office that he had agreed to delay his trip to washington to today , instead of yesterday .
sources reported that president lahud was informed at 3:15 pm yesterday that powell thanked him for setting a time for him today .
following this , an american delegation arrived from jerusalem yesterday afternoon . they are concerned with the protocol for the visit and security and are headed by g . b .
malory , head of powell 's diplomatic security ( former head of security at the american embassy in aukar four months ago ) . it held a meeting with a number of officials as part of the security preparations for the visit .
according to an american diplomatic source yesterday evening , powell will arrive at beirut airport from israel at 8:30 am . he will be met at the airport by minister of foreign affairs and emigrants mahmoud hamoud , who will accompany him to the republican palace , where we will hold a meeting with president lahud for 90 minutes . prime minister al-hariri and minister hamoud will attend .
he said that powell would read a press statement but would not answer journalists ' question and that the visit would last three hours .
the delegation accompanying him will comprise state department spokesman richard boucher and executive secretary greg kelly . the delegation will be joined , in place of ambassador patel , by the charge d ' affaires at the embassy carol kalin and by political advisor at the embassy ann boudin .
an american media delegation will accompany powell .
it has been decided that powell will travel to damascus after beirut . from there it will be decided whether to return to jerusalem or washington in light of discussions undertaken by the team accompanying him , which has remained in israel .
deputy secretary - general of hizbollah sheikh naim qasim confirmed , " despite the israeli crimes and massacres taking place with clear and explicit american support , the supporting and sinful international silence , and poor arab indifference , history will record that the resistance fighters and the palestinian people stood firm and acted out a great epic . "
at a commemorative celebration in the al-silm quarter he said , " what is taking place in palestine has freed the arabs from other wars that would have taken place against them . it has prevented the americans from implementing plans they had laid for the movements and countries in our islamic world . the intifada has been the first line of defense for every nobleman . no one thinks that the israeli massacres have struck a cruel blow against the palestinian intifada . in fact what is taking place has mobilized everyone in the arab and islamic street against america and so we are now before a culture and vision that makes the rejection of the zionist entity and its designs much greater than it was fifty years ago . "
he called the palestinian authority " to trust its people , their resistance and great gifts , so that it will be worthy at this stage to represent hopes and aspirations because it relies on genuine strength provided by the palestinian people . these sacrifices can only confront israeli arrogance . we also appreciate the pressures applied by america , israel and the arrogant states for concession and the effacement of the vestiges of these sacrifices " . he stressed , " with a little patience , forbearance and confidence in this noble people , palestinian hopes will be realized and israel will not be able to achieve what it wants . "
on the domestic issue he said , " in the last few days we have mounted intensive operations in the shabaa farms in order to make israel anxious and communicate different messages that we support the liberation of territory and the right of the palestinian people , and confirm that the arena will not be left open before the zionists to gain greater dominance . this is our natural right . "
he added , " have confidence that were the islamic resistance not ready in the south and prepared to defend and carry out acts to shows its presence , the israeli enemy would have perpetrated a tragedy in lebanon . its aircraft would have come and killed many people in a number of villages and towns and there would have been limited invasions in the name of israeli security and to protect israel from potential danger following its departure from lebanon . "
deputy hussein al-hajj hasan believed , " what is taking place in palestine is an american attempt to invest in the zionist enemy against the palestinian people and transform this into political results . what ( colin ) powell wants to offer to ( yasir ) arafat is an agreement for the surrender of palestine in the face of the zionist war machine within the framework of the tenet and mitchell agreements .
during a meeting of solidarity with the palestinian people organized by the hizbollah women 's authorities in the hussein building of imam al-khomeini in baalbak he said , " what is demanded of the palestinians today is that they collect arms , guarantee israeli security , detain the fighters , condemn suicide attacks and control the streets in return for a promise to complete the negotiating process at war , without the strength or determination to ensure right prevails . sharon , meanwhile , explicitly expressed his ideas to solve the palestinian issue , namely that he does not want to break up the settlement , but look for alternatives to the present palestinian authority , establish four palestinian living areas , expel a large number of palestinians and not give up jerusalem . "
he criticized " the arab political regimes that have adopted the option of settlement and are unable to issue a statement of condemnation and disapproval , unable even to speak " .
he concluded , " the intifada has put the israelis in a political , security , economic , psychological and moral impasse . this is why the israeli response is barbaric and criminal . "
* hizbollah held the funeral of fighter yusif muhammad hijazi in his town of al-namiriyyah . deputy abdallah qasir led the mourners and gave a speech , saying that what was happening in palestine was " a new confirmation of the soundness of the resistance method and that all speculations on the negotiations with the zionist enemy , and on the american role and all mediations , would fail and would not restore to the nation its right or territory . nor would they protect the holy sites . "
" now every arab bears a palestinian heart and the road to palestine only passes through palestine " , phrases spoken by palestinian poet mahmoud darwish yesterday that echoed in the kamil shamun sport city among twenty thousand lebanese and palestinians who had come to declare their solidarity with the forbearance of the palestinian people in " palestine day in lebanon - besiege your siege " , the invitation for which was issued by the publisher of the al-safir newspaper , colleague tallal sulaiman , and commemorated by the poet along with artists majdah al-rumi and ahmad qaabur .
lebanese and palestinians flags waved across the sport city , which was half - filled , alongside the banners of the progressive socialist , communist and national syrian social parties , al-murabitun and the popular front for the liberation of palestine , in addition to pictures of che guevara , kamal junbalat and yasir arafat , and slogans such as " jerusalem is ours " and " we are all martyrs " .
a number of prominent political figures were at the forefront of those present , the most prominent of which was president salim al-hiss , deputy walid junbalat , minister marwan hamadah , ghazi al-aridi , bisharah marhaj , fuad al-sinyurah , " national forum " deputies and many others .
as ahmad qaabur called out , " i call on you , i grasp you hands more tightly " , and at the songs of marcel khalifah and al-sheikh imam , the public entered the stadium with the flags . those of the progressive socialists dominated .
following the national anthem and a minute 's silence to mourn the martyrs of palestine , the master of ceremonies said , " we meet today to say that we are surrounded with palestine , in palestine and like palestine , to confirm that palestine is broader than its territory . "
darwish began his speech by going back in time 20 years : " it was here that the siege of beirut began 20 years ago . this is where palestinian and lebanese blood was shed in defense of beirut , which did not surrender . "
near here , the invaders perpetrated one of the massacres of this age .
near here , yasir arafat was asked : where are you going ?
he answered : i am going from here to palestine (...). in those ashen days , no one believed anyone because hope lay beneath the ruins .
now , 20 years on , we find beirut has recovered its basis , its order and its national unity . we see our collective heart , palestine , plunging with its flesh and blood into the final bloody installment of this tale of freedom and independence .
now every arab bears a palestinian heart .
now we are all palestinians (...) the land is the body , the body is the land and the road to palestine only passes through palestine .
yasir arafat is besieged in his office denying his exile (...).
everything has changed , with the exception of the criminal hero who is still the same . he has only been promoted from general to the top of government . "
he confirmed , " there can be no peace with occupation , no security with occupation , no life with occupation and no peace process to parallel that of genocide .
our pain is great but our hopes are greater (...) we will love life because we are children of life . "
he told the story of a fighter from the besieged jenin camp who met his fried outside the camp and said to him , " tell me a joke to make me laugh before i become a martyr . " his friend asked him , " how can you laugh when you are about to die ? "
he answered , " because i love life , i want to leave it laughing (...) a people who love life to this extent will not be deserted by it . they must win . "
" how often were you alone . it is another hijra . do not write your last testament " . the voice of darwish echoed around the stadium as he began his reading with excerpts from the first book he published after leaving beirut in 1982 under the title " eulogy to high shadow " . many repeated with him his famous poem " besiege your siege , there is no escape " , which majdah al-rumi sang after saluting the palestinian people .
" what is taking place today in palestine is a crime against humanity and i have come to declare my final and eternal rejection of the occupation of palestine . "
she addressed the palestinians via the satellite channels : " our hearts are with your . our spirits are with you . truth is with you . the land will return to you . "
darwish continued with a selection of his other revolutionary and combative poems , including " record that i am an arab " , the conclusion of which was met with loud applause : " i do not hate the people , nor do i attack anyone , but when i am hungry i eat the flesh of the person who rapes me " .
there was then a section with ahmad qaabur , who said : " 20 years ago at this spot the criminal destroyed sabra and shatila .
from this spot we say today : we do not commit suicide for the love of it , but we sacrifice ourselves as martyrs in love for life " .
the public accompanied him as he sang , " i call on you , i grasp you hands more tightly and i kiss the ground beneath your feet " ( by poet tawfiq ziad ) , which he repeated twice at the request of the crowd . he followed this with the song " pulse of the bank , don 't be calm " .
the final section of poetry with darwish included a selection of poem , the most prominent of which was " passers - by among passing words " , which is addressed to the jews .

the choice of sport city as a place to commemorate the " besiege your siege " festival , in solidarity with the palestinian people , was no simple coincidence or the result of some logistical requirement .
you realize this as soon as soon as you step foot in the city environs . but not before , when all you see is an open space rebuilt for the pursuit of sporting activities , the function for which it was originally built before the war in 1975 .
yesterday afternoon sport city reclaimed the role it had played during a quarter of a century of war , when all sorts on unsporting activity were practiced there .
it opened its arm to embrace the palestinian cause and to recall , with its people , bitter , sad and black memories .
the city in this sense has a special place in the memory of the lebanese generally and the palestinians specifically .
on 4 june 1982 israeli military aircraft shelled it , making it the first site in the capital to be targeted by the fire of the invasion , transforming it almost to rubble .
the city is also the place where palestinians , those who were still alive , came barefoot , naked , hungry and thirsty under the barrels of israeli army guns , which were preparing to complete the massacre they had begun in shatila camp for over three days .
sport city yesterday was not just an open playing field for 50 thousand people , nor just a place for a massive celebration . the choice of the location , as the organizers said , and as those who attended , took part and undertook this act of solidarity felt , was first and foremost linked to memory .
it is the symbol .
it is the silent witness to the massacres perpetrated by the israelis when they invaded beirut in 1982 , in shatila camp to be precise , which was separated from the city at that time only by sand dunes .
suddenly the hands of the clock turned back .
and the place became piles of rubble from which the smell of gunpowder and death rose .
today is no different to yesterday .
all were present , those commemorating and those being commemorated .
the martyrs in shatila , the martyrs in nablus , jenin and ramallah , whose blood has not yet run cold , who had no place in which to rest other than mass graves , the number and size of which is not yet known .
this is how sport city cut short the distance of time once more .
for the events witnessed by shatila camp in 1982 is no more than one chapter in the chapters of massacres perpetrated by ariel sharon today , as yesterday , in palestine , as in beirut .
perhaps the only difference between today and yesterday is that the place described by the poet mahmoud darwish in his effective words when he said , " palestine has returned home .
true palestine has returned to her true home .
the palestinian people fight on their land , land that is in the body and the body the land .
the road to palestine only passes through palestine . "
the place yesterday was not sports city .
it was palestine , with all the meanings that this word contains .
it is no small detail that we should commemorate palestine in beirut today under the slogan " besiege your siege " .
it is also no small detail that mahmoud darwish should address the palestinians from beirut and specifically from sports city and that he should be with the lebanese and the palestinians whose blood , as he said , was shed in defense of beirut , who did not surrender .
more than 20 thousand people came yesterday to sports city from different regions , raising the slogan " besiege your siege " in solidarity with the palestinian people in one of the forms of solidarity witnessed by beirut on a daily basis since the bloody events began in palestine .
they all took part : communists , nationalists , socialists , " fighters " and " hizbollah " , and , of course , all the palestinian groups .
their signs indicated who they were . supporters of the lebanese parties did not hesitate to climb the electricity pylons from which to hang their flags , so that they might fly high , as part of a competitiveness the lebanese cannot hide no matter what the occasion , bearing in mind that it was the day of palestine and only the palestinian flag should have been flying . public auctions will take place on other occasions .
everyone applauded as they liked and everyone observed the minute 's silence in their own way .
some sang , others read the opening chapter of the quran in a loud voice .
silence did not reign , in honor of the martyrs .
mahmoud darwish 's calm , loud and warm voice united the echo and put palestine back where it belong , in the hearts and minds of all arabs : " now every arab bears a palestinian heart .
now we are all palestinians without distinction . "
yesterday beirut was the beating heart of palestine .

do you have the feeling that we , in our civil society , should drink from the river of corruption and join in with the rampant conditions around us ?
so that we can be accepted in our society ?
it really is a worrying feeling to be different , to be looked at as if you are from another planet for just enquiring about the damage done by corruption . it 's as if you are unique in your restraint , either because you 're not benefiting or because you 're stupid . you must choose . ..
the independent anti - corruption authority , a well - known international authority , defines corruption as a crime against society and its interests .
it defines corruption as a violation of society 's trust , leading to inequality among citizens and the waste of public and private money .
it defines corruption as an immoral and prejudicial act in the use of power or position , giving preference to some over others .
corruption takes many forms in politics , as in administration .
in the public sector , as in the private .
for example : misuse of position , bribery , embezzlement , falsification , theft , misappropriation , tax evasion , and damage to the interests of the state and citizens .
on 06 / 06 / 1996 the chamber of deputies passed the law developing the finance market and credit agreements .
one of the reasons for needing this law was to develop banking and financial work and to help develop the financial markets with the aim of encouraging investment and capital influx by permitting the setting up of credit contracts .
everyone , from businessmen to layers and financiers , rejoiced at the law and the positive benefits it would bring to lebanon , especially as it was the first of its kind in the region , but the hopes placed in it were soon dashed .
on a date following this law the lebanese government issued a draft law regulating moveable value collective investment organizations , but instead of applying the credit technology to it , it applied the technology of common ownership .
at the time we wrote an article strongly criticizing this arrangement under the title , call to the chamber of deputies for the moveable value collective investment organizations law , which is published in our book " what is new in lebanese trade , banking and arbitration laws in light of jurisprudence and ijtihad " on page 63 .
we enumerated the benefits of the credit technology , thereby proving that the application of common ownership , which most developed countries do not use , was infeasible , especially given that the credit contracts law essentially aims to be a useful tool for all the various financial operations , including those of collective investment and support organizations .
the draft municipalities law put forward by the minister of the interior and municipalities , approved by the council of ministers , remains before him for ratification and promulgation now that its details have been discussed and proposals and observations recorded on its clauses in the chamber of deputies .
this project , which has seen a lot of popular and official interest , contains a prominent survey of the modernizations of the state , the development of its tools , and the establishment of the constitutional provisions for consolidating administrative decentralization through its laws and the expansion of its framework , in order to help solve the obstacles confronting the progress of the state , both institutions and citizens , in the administrative , economic and social fields .
the municipalities law promulgated under legislative decree 118 / 77 represented a serious and qualitative shift . senior legal figures , who have been involved in municipal work and helped regulate and head unions , have been involved in it .
the law on practice and experience , which brought out breaches and worked to avoid disputes and make municipal work more productive and effective as part of clear legal rules and financial independence , was included in the text of the proposed draft .
these texts of the present draft , which one must say represents the start of rain from the heavens for the process of comprehensive legislative and credit development , which begin with it and continue through laws on administrative decentralization and other laws that will come to light to consolidate the state of law and institutions , stopped at the outline headings .
there were two typographical errors in the introduction to " al-nahar issues " in the article by dr shahid alam " what if a female jewish suicide bomber blew herself up ?

engineers in the north elected fuad al-dahir as the new head of their syndicate yesterday , to succeed president of the syndicate bashir dhuq , whose term has come to an end .
the list comprising al-dahir , engineers asad talib and riyadh ghazalah as members of the syndicate board , and engineer jan faranjiyyah to the retirement fund administration , won .
1336 engineers voted out of a total of 3032 allowed to vote , i . e . 44 % .
in view of the fact that about 600 registered engineers paid their subscriptions from outside lebanon , the turnout rose to about 55 % .
the victory of the new president of the syndicate confirms the spirit of democracy that prevailed in the syndicate elections , despite the blocs that were established , according to al-dahir . he added , " we must go and realize the program that we have drawn up , which will put the syndicate among national concerns , especially given the economic situation in the country , and participate in drafting laws and studies that will help to overcome the present crisis . "
written by daniel al-khayyat :
there are two pillars to the beqaa economy , which will only make progress when they are healthy . they are agriculture and the food industry , which complement one another . what ever happens to one is inevitably reflected on the other .
what is the reality of the food industries today , and through them those of agriculture ?
where do they stand in the face of the rapidly approaching challenges with lebanon becoming a trade partner of the eu states ?
what problems obstruct their growth and development ?
president of the food industries syndicate atif idris answered these and other questions saying , " the food and agriculture industries have bee through a very difficult period over the last seven years as a result of illegal competition from the state and development programs .
written by eli qahwaji :
the american dollar continued to move at the high end of the margin for bank of lebanon intervention in the beirut discount market throughout last week , in an atmosphere of anxiety linked to the continued military deterioration
in the palestinian territories and fears that it could spread to the lebanese - israeli borders .
the arrival of american secretary of state to the region and his initiating contacts with the leaders of its state as part of a serious attempt to find a settlement to the dispute between israel and the palestinian authority had only limited effect on the activity of the local market , but not on its direction . the same could be said of the calls from more than one regional , international and local party to reduce tension on the southern front and not to give israel a pretext to expand its war against palestinians to include lebanon and even syria .
in its previous meeting the council of ministers asked the minister of finance to submit appropriate proposals on the matter of abolishing authorizations for cost contract controllers and chartered accountants for some public organizations , in preparation for the matter to be presented once more to the council of ministers .
in its letter dated 08 / 03 / 2002 , the ministry of finance had told the council of minister that it had become apparent that " many public organizations were experiencing vacancies in the positions of cost contract controllers and accountants because these tasks were being performed by employers charged from public departments or public organizations under decisions issued by the council of ministers , the minister of custodianship , the board of directors or the committees thereof . this has reflected negatively on the performance of these organizations as some of these employees and staff are conducting their tasks without having the independence and competency which both an accountant and cost controller should have in order to monitor the financial business of the organizations and manage their funds in the best and soundest possible way .
consequently , given the above , and pursuant to the article that stipulates that every accountant and cost controller should be appointed by a decision of the chairman of the board of directors , following the approval of the custodial authority and the civil service council , the ministry is presenting the matter to the council of ministers , proposing that these authorizations be abolished ( attached to ministry letter 192 , p . 16 , dated 08 / 03 / 2002 ) and that a decision be taken to respect norms when appointing people to these two important positions . "
the engineers in beirut have chosen " freedom of syndicate expression and democratic representation " , electing subhi al-bassat as the new president of the syndicate for the coming three years in a fierce election battle , in which al-bassat confronted his rival , leader of the al-hariri institution graduates association , bilal hamad , and the election machine of the " al-mustaqbal current " .
al-bassat 's victory shows two things : first , the rejection by the engineering base , despite the plurality of their party and political affiliations , of direct political interventions and their adherence to the independence of professional and syndicate choice .
secondly , the prominent exit of the prime minister 's candidate , which reflects the departure of al-hariri and the drafts adopted by his government , notably the amendment to the construction law . this indicates a new phase of syndicate dealings at the syndicate of engineers with the government 's development and construction policy , which had made progress during the term of the previous president of the syndicate samir dumat , who was also supported by the " al-mustaqbal current " .
the results show a notable difference , namely that al-bassat penetrated the list of hamad fusat al-akhir with the five members of his list winning . the results were as follows :
* position of president of the syndicate :
- al-bassat 3326 votes against 3051 votes for hamad .
* branch 1 : imad wakim ( lebanese forces ) 2776 votes against 2253 votes for candidate tony abi aql ( free patriotic current ) from the second list .
* branch 7 : lutfi salum ( baath party ) 2686 votes against 2126 votes for his rival ibrahim abu sawan .
* general authority :
- mustafa fawaz ( " amal " movement ) 2756 votes .
- rimon khuri ( national bloc ) 2864 votes .
bashir abi akr ( progressive ) 2543 votes .
it was noticeable that the difference in votes between the last winner for the general authority and the first loser , george numan ( free ) , was only 10 votes , with numan scoring 2533 votes .
he asked for a recount .
syndicate circles noted that the distribution of votes between the candidates on hamad 's list and the independent candidates , which led to members of hamad 's list winning despite their affiliation to the same political environment and the same alliances .
it was also noticed that the " free patriotic current " , which took about 1200 votes for al-bassat , lost their candidate abi aql in branch 1 , as a result of the votes being shared between him and other candidates .
immediately after the results were announced , the new president of the syndicate was greeted by the previous president , samir dumat , and new and former members . he gave a speech thanking those who had voted for him and those who had allied themselves with him for their confidence in him .
the new president of the syndicate gave a speech in which he confirmed that " free opinion is the only victor in the syndicate elections " . he believed that all his colleagues on the list " were victorious despite their defeat " .
he thanked all those who had voted for him and supported his election campaign .
it was a long election day , which began calmly in the morning thanks to the internal security forces , who had deployed at the entrances to the syndicate building in order to guarantee that the election process was sound .
the areas and rooms of the building were densely filled with affiliated engineers paying their dues for this year .
the election process was not without battle , represented in the strong competition between the two lists of hamad and al-bassat , who accused the authority of " scandalously " intervening for the benefit of hamad , transforming the battle from its syndicate character .
the withdrawals process took place , with hizbollah choosing to remain outside the alliances and voting for candidate ghassan al-khatib , the " lebanese forces " candidate from branch 1 on hamad 's list . the battalions base , in turn , remained outside the two lists , forming a mixed list of candidates from both lists and voted on this basis .
al-bassat could not hide his annoyance at the focused political intervention for the benefit of his rival 's list , noting that the pressures on votes had led them to be exploited for private benefit and some had been tempted by the promise of work .
for his part , hamad rejected the accusations saying , " this great support for our list from the graduates of the american , arab , lebanese , jesuit , al-alba , al-kaslik , and the graduates from america , europe and the arab states , not to mention the support of the engineering forces in the al-mustaqbal current , " amal " , the " lebanese forces , the progressive socialist party , the national bloc , the brigades and the baath , has scared them . "
the branch of the faculty of engineering and architecture at the american university issued a statement rejecting the " libelous manner " and accusations made against the graduates of the faculty for their adopting a position in support of hamad 's candidature from among the three candidates from the graduates of the american university . "
" they either want me imprisoned , expelled or dead . i say to them that i will only be a martyr , a martyr , a martyr . "
with these words , which were spoken by chairman arafat from his besieged headquarters in ramallah , began the program " under siege " on " aljazeera " . the timing of the daily broadcast , after midnight , has encouraged most arab viewers to try the hot and open political line , which has carried a wave of expressions of stinging criticism and sarcasm directed against arab regimes . at times , some of it has even attacked or libeled arab rulers . a large number of those ringing in have not hesitated to accuse them of conspiring with israel in respect of events in the occupied palestinian territories . others have sarcastically asked for the program to be shown earlier because arab leaders are fast asleep at that time .
still others are ringing in to show greater disdain , noting the need to open the arab fund for donations to buy televisions or receiver dishes for those arab leaders who are perhaps unaware of what is taking place in jenin and nablus .
the anger of some viewers has become so great that they have rung in and asked sharon to continue his journey in order to remove what arab regimes remain .
the media arena that " aljazeera " has put at the disposal of the viewer thus seems to be a small window by which the arab street can penetrate the wall of silence , as an outlet for it and as a way of expressing the degree of frustration and the siege which the peoples are living under the authority of these regimes , which can do nothing but tame their peoples and promote their defeatist policies . this was clearly evident when a female citizen of the gulf came out from the bottle of royalty and principality to warn the rulers that the policy of americanization will be to no avail and will not last long , and that the frustration created by the bans on demonstrations will lead to an explosion with dire consequences .
it was also striking that most participants avoided rhetorical language and exaltation of the arab nations . nationalist language dominated and characterized the views of most of those contacting by telephone , fax or internet .
" aljazeera " has succeeded in becoming a medium by means of this daily program , which carries calls for marches and demonstrations for solidarity with the palestinians . useful ideas have been put forward by means of it .
the program presenters have helped to educate the viewer and the picture accompanying the contacts has succeeded in breaking the inertia and creating influence .
if " under siege " started from the circumstances in which chairman arafat finds himself , the title , by means of the daily contacts , has come to apply to most arab leaders , who are now also " under siege " .
geraldine is a lively and active girl . she is a good hostess and is very flexible , a quality she inherited from her father , charlie chaplin . the precise features of her face and hairstyle recall her mother , oona .
the book " contemporary lovers " , recently published by historian claudine montai , expounds chaplin 's life from london to his swiss exile in vivai , passing through the hollywood studios and the charlie 's great love for oona .
geraldine helped her to draw up the biography using her recollections and emotions for numerous researches conducted by the historian into the history of the family .
chaplin 's daughter thought it " a clever idea for us to discuss my mother and father 's childhood , their adolescence and the ' love at first sight ' that was the beginning of a very romantic story (...) my mother never left him after that .
i believe that the work we have done is marvelous and brave (...)."
charlie chaplin married three times before meeting oona o ' neil , daughter of novelist eugene o ' neil , to become his eternal partner and provide him with the psychological support over seventeen years .
did these two lovers care for their children ? " my father loved my mother more than anything , even our children came in second place .
my mother and father behaved like lovers and loved each other without stopping like two adolescents on the back seat of the car , " confesses geraldine .
" my first recollections in the cinema are about the film " seizing gold "
my mother used to see films at home . my brother michel used to cry when he saw charlo eating his shoes .
this made my father angry , and he said to her , " i do not know why you are determined to let that child see these films . he does not laugh (...) we received a harsh and unusual upbringing in the restaurant .
my father 's favorite dish was trout , which he would kiss calling it emma . "
author claudine has not forgotten to link the life of the chaplin family with the historical events through which they lived in " contemporary lovers " .
she has supported her statements with rapid examples in a lively style that reflects her personality .
this greatly affected geraldine .
charlie chaplin was born in 1889 at the end of the reign of queen victoria .
sarah barnard achieved considerable success at the paris theatres at this time and the lumiere brothers had invented the first cinema filming device four years earlier .
chaplin played the film " the baby " in 1919 following the death of his three - day old son .
this coincided with the signing of the versailles treaty .
hitler , chaplin 's future enemy , declared the principles of the nazi party .
one should note that charlie chaplin and hitler were born in the same year and the same month with only four days separating them .
chaplin felt attracted to and enmity towards hitler at the same time .
hitler banned the showing of chaplin 's films in germany and burned his pictures in vienna : " people think that my father was jewish by his mother .
this is not true , but my father did not deny it at the time out of respect for his jewish friends . "
the parents supported their daughter geraldine to learn dancing at the age of fifteen " because my father believed i was a bad influence over my siblings whilst order and self - discipline prevailed at the ballet school " .
my father was conservative .
why ?
he did not want to be embarrassed by my exploiting his name in the school , with me promising my friends that they could meet him provided that they did my school work . "
geraldine later became the star of carlos sora 's films . her last role was in the film " i was talking to her " by pedro almodovar : " almodovar reminds me of my father because he is skilled at provoking laughter and tears . "
oona could not accept her husband 's death on the 25th of december 19777 and did not forgive him for his death - " how did he dare to do something like that ? ". she tried in vain to overcome her grief and search for new love , until she found that love in july 1991 .
western beqaa - " al-nahar " :
the chamber of deputies laid the foundation stones for eight educational projects yesterday in the areas of the western beqaa and rashia under the patronage of minister of education and higher education , abd al-rahim murad , and the leader of the council , qablan qablan . this took place in the presence of deputies from the region , the district leader of the western beqaa , mani al-maqdad , rashia dhiab salum , head of the education area , emil maakarun , head of the al-laitani water utility , nasir nasrallah , and social and educational figures .
the first event was the opening of the al-rashidiyyah school and the inauguration of the al-khayyarah school , followed by the laying of the foundation stone for the al-sultan yaaqub school and lucy school . foundations stones were then laid at schools in khirbat ruha , then in jub farah and izz al-arab . foundations stones were also laid for two secondary schools in al-qaraun and jub jenin . ceremonies were held on these occasions , in which a number of people from the towns and village spoke , praising the national development role played by the chamber of deputies . they asked that it continue in view of the elements of forbearance it provided .
in his speech qablan focused on construction in the face of destruction . he said , " now is not the time for words . these occasions are not happy ones . what is taking place in palestine stops the smiles , cause tears to flow and keeps joy away from us . our people there are dying whilst the arab nation watches . it is as if god has become angry at this nation and caused them to talk much and do little . we had wanted these occasions to be happy ones , but on account of palestine , its people and the blood of the martyrs there , these meetings are just to confirm that we are continuing to work in solidarity with our people there , albeit in word . "
he added , " we confirm to you that we will continue to work in these areas and we promise you that we are alongside you with these modest capacities , continuing to coordinate with those departments that are working , when not all of the state 's departments are and most of the ministries are absent . "
murad praised the council and its leader , which had endeavored to provide the schools ' requirements and all the other social needs in these areas . "
he added , " we will overcome the deadly administrative routine , which prevents the wishes and needs of these areas being carried out in the south , the western beqaa , rashia and other areas . "
he noted that whilst there was construction in lebanon there was destruction in palestine , where an entire people was being killed , regrettably , within sight and sound of the whole world . he expressed astonishment at the way the world was watching what was happening in wounded palestine . regrettably , it is arab silence that has encouraged the enemy to continue in these massacres , killings and destruction . "
students biya zinun , who is in the formation stage at sayyidah al-luizah university where she hopes to study psychology , and maya madi , who is studying translation and arabisation at st joseph university , won the english language speakers federation - lebanon branch competition .
each received a grant to travel to london to take part in the international competition held by the federation alongside representatives from numerous countries .
the federation organized the competition at the end of last week at the lebanese - american university . female competitors far exceeded males .
14 competitors took part from the american , lebanese - american , st joseph and sayyidah al-luizah universities .
the topic chosen for this year was " the fact of the economy in confronting the state of the environment " .
following a welcome speech by the head of the human sciences department at the lebanese american university , dr samirah aghasi , the president of the federation organizing the competition from the lebanon branch , yumna asili , spoke of " the importance of organizing the competition in several universities , which is what we do each year .
we look at the manner in which the competitor addresses their message and for clear and coherent content . "
the judges ' panel comprised the dutch ambassador , kleiweg de zwaan , the head of the civil development department at the solider company , angus ghafat ,
lecturer at the faculty of human sciences at the lebanese - american university , nailah harati , the head of the creative writing department at the american university in beirut , dr rozanne khalaf , and president of the federation of english language speakers in lebanon , yumna asili .
it is noted that the committee judged the competitors in four areas : the manner in which the speech was given and the method used , general disposition , general appearance and ability to respond to the questions from students present .
whilst no microphone was provided for competitors a significant number were able to speak in a loud voice and the progress of their ideas was clear .
but some departed from the main focus of their speech or repeated their ideas in a different way , causing them to make obvious errors , which was down to lack of prior preparation .
rana haidar , the student who won the competition in the last few years from the arab university , presented the competitors . her colleague ( the second place winner ) susan marhan ensured that each observed the time period allocated to them , which was no more than five minutes .
the british ambassador , richard kinchen , soon joined the judges ' panel for selection of the winners .
before the results were announced , winner liali aghazi from the lebanese american university addressed the competitors and talked about her experience last year in london . she called on them to be " lebanon 's ambassadors at this stage , to leave their country proud and with esteem " .
before the final results were announced , prizes were distributed to all the competitors - subscriptions in the " life style " sports club . the names of the two winners were then announced .
zaghrata - by tony jibrail faranjiyyah .
" responsible citizenship " was the title of the final lecture of the program of lectures and debates accompanying the 2001 zaghrata book cultural festival , in which minister jan lui qirdahi and dr antoine masarrah took part . dr frederick maatuq led and interested persons attended .
the national anthem started proceedings and was followed by a word of welcome for those present , who were introduced to dr maatuq and told that " responsible citizenship " was a hot topic . dr masarrah then gave his contribution under the title " building the culture of citizenship in lebanon " , in which he answered the six questions he had identified . during this he explained why the culture of citizenship was important today in lebanon and he called for immunity to be developed against internal conflicts and foreign interventions , demanding that all take part in the responsibility , because if they did not practice it , this would constitute a major problem .
he then noted that there was no contradiction between citizenship and membership of a sectarian group provided that the area of common ground was expanded because common action was important .
he dealt with the elements of the culture of citizenship in lebanon , identifying the relationship to place , people and authority , stressing that the self - confidence of citizens was the most important element of the culture of citizenship because there was no hope for the situation when the will gives in .
he talked about the obstacles to the culture of citizenship , identifying them as the small size of the country , the fatigue of the people , the remnants of convention in spoon - fed education , the fact the authority was a source of negative values and the concept of the state . he indicated that , historically , the state was a tool of suppression that monopolized organized powers . its work was only good when citizens became involved , called it to account and monitored it . for these reasons the lebanese will wait a long time for a capable and just state .
he dealt with production in this field , referring to the " upcoming generations " and " tomorrow 's citizen " program , the book " building citizenship " in lebanon and the books of the educational research and development center . he said that these books " had created some sort of reconciliation between the people and the authority , which was an educational process led by professor munir abu asali that constituted one of the most important cultural achievements in lebanon since the 1920s . it was a new and not an easy educational process for lebanon and the region . "
he concluded by answering the sixth question - what is needed for the future ?
he said , " at least for the next five years , the culture of citizenship must be lebanised and arabised .
there has been a large production in the publishing of books communicating what has been written in american , england and elsewhere about human rights . some are trying to apply these to lebanon and other arab states .
and this is not always correct .
the principles of democracy and international human rights , these must be commended . but educating for citizenship drowns in the particular details . "
minister jan lui qirdahi then spoke , saying , " we must first get out of the division of the country on sectarian or religious grounds and work together so that we have a common sense of patriotism and citizenship , and of belonging to this country , which we must believe to be more than just a place of residence .
we must believe that lebanon has a message . muslim - christian co - existence in lebanon is a message to the whole world . it is the only place where everyone is addressed and where everyone participates in decision - making . i call everyone to make a country in which they can co - exist and overcome all class and sectarian boundary . "
he added , " it is very important that the lebanese agree to common elements and their minimum requirement . we must persuade the young people of their role in the future of this country because the responsibility is not limited exclusively to those present at the center of responsibility . it begins at home , from education and the school . every person can practice it wherever they are (...)".
he noted , " the freedom of every person ends where the freedom of the next person begins . if the other 's freedom is not respected , there can be no opportunity for a life of freedom . we must also not cast the responsibilities on to others because we are all responsible . "
he then discussed the issue of justice , saying that sometimes it was relative . " we cannot build plato 's republic but must interact with circumstances which are not always positive (...) i therefore call on the young people to be a permanent presence in their society with responsible citizenship , which will drive them to interact directly with the affairs of their towns and community and to participate in a significant way in this responsibility . "
the association of university pastoral work graduates held its sixth meeting at the school of the apostles in junieh under the title " the gospel - full - time citizenship " .
the meeting was attended by the chairman of the ecclesiastical education and cultural committee , archbishop ghi bulus najim , former director of the association , fr. malik abu tanus , director general of university pastoral work at the holy spirit university in al-kaslik , fr. shirbil kiruz , a group of priests , dr antoine musarrah , deputy director of the association , marcel ishaq , and the members .
the meeting began with prayer . participants were then split into discussion groups where they discussed topics relating to the concept of citizenship , ways to practice it , the obstacles before it , the relationship of the lebanese to public place , the earth and the environment , the relationship with the other , the concept of the state , its role and the elements of democracy and civil society .
following a short break , the participants presented the conclusions of the groups .
dr antoine musarrah then spoke on the topic of the meeting . he believed , " states work soundly and become democratic when the citizens demand their rights and participate in their national obligations . "
he noted that many people used the term state in order to throw responsibility on its shoulders .
he called for the term to be used in only three cases : when resorting to organized force , when negotiating at an official level between states and in the sphere of socio - economic balance . in other cases , matters should be signified using their proper names .
he added , " the gospel is full - time citizenship . citizenship means the relationship of man to the place where he was born and lives , and to the people who live there .
no one , no matter how pessimistic , can thus generalize this feeling of his to others , so that he does not aid in the collapse of society . "
he continued , " if in reason i am a believer , i cannot abuse the other from another religion because my faith prevents from this , not because i believe in common living . "
the association of graduates also honored its former director , fr. malik abu tanus . the deputy president of the association made a speech of thanks before giving to the former director a commemorative present in the name of the association .
at midday , archbishop najim celebrated mass , during which he gave a sermon saying , " every day new scientific discoveries make us discover more about man " .
he added , " if god has granted us that we should progress though the sciences to many truths , then the creator by doing this addresses man . "
he continued , " we should not fear the truth . the truth is man .
the responsibility is great but what is important is that we educate our people and that there is not a gap separating the people from the educated class . "
he called for work for " the unity of the church so that it may be one , as the son is one with the father . "
he called on young people to be " tools of peace in the manner of christ , who reconciles all people with god " .
he believed , " practical love is that which encourages people to faith . christianity is full - time citizenship . christians today , more so than at any other time , are called to live in open arab citizenship . "
the occasion was attended by minister murad , deputies atif majdalani , walid eido and marwan faris , director general at the minister of education george naamah , director of secondary teaching , director of guidance and direction , representative of the director of central inspection and the heads of educational areas .
murad praised , " the great stock enjoyed by the person being honored in this secondary school , across the entire education sector and among various educationalists and their friends . this shows that during her long years of service she was devoted to her work , on top of her duties and keen to ensure their success , devoting herself to her noble task , as a teacher , educator and official . "
he stressed , " her role has not come to an end with retirement because people like her do not like to live with nothing to do . it is certain that she has more than one option after she leaves this secondary school to continue her mission and open up a new field of production and achievement . "
baalbak - " al-nahar " :
the statue of the poet of the two countries , khalil mutran , in baalbak is still suffering from neglect and requires restoration .
the statue stands at the main entrance to baalbak in a square bearing his name , some meters away from the palmera hotel on the northern side .
the statue overlooks the citadel temple and structures . at present the area from the lower part of his knees to the soles of his feet appears a different color after the paint has been worn away and hollow cavities corroded . these are the same parts that were restored after the statue was blown up during the war . it was re - erected on the 27th of august 1995 in a major ceremony that became a forum for the meeting of more than one arab country by the efforts of the " oasis of literature in the beqaa " , which was headed at that time by poet judat rustum haidar .
the garden that bears the name of the poet in which stands the statue hardly resembles a garden . there is no greenery , flowers or water and even the iron fence is broken . there is no electrical lighting and the electricity station remains before the statue in the middle of the boulevard - one of a range of major and chronic blemishes obstructing the view .
al-nahar raised this matter some years ago .
and bear in mind that the electricity company has given up the room , which is empty and unused .
in the face of this crumbling situation there exists a project study prepared by the municipality of baalbak to re - establish the garden and an implementation decision to be determined by the contractor , but no one knows the reason for the delay .
despite the baalbak festivals the existing picture of the area remains as it was . even the home of khalil mutran a few meters away is on the point of collapse with most of its walls cracked . just looking at it makes one feel worse . even the marble plaque bearing the name of the poet mutran is showing the effects of nature and corrosion . the letters have lost their black color .
the question remains : when will people , the state and cultural organizations take an interest in the legacy of the greats and the features of the poet mutran , from his statue to his square and home , no longer be wretched ? "
will the municipality or the ministry of culture respond ? "
it is not strange that there should be much talk about the step taken by american ambassador vincent patel on the 25th of last march in respect of the educational research and development center , gifting it english language learning books .

public affairs advisor at the american embassy in beirut deborah smith summarized for " al-nahar " the importance of the project to promote american culture , saying , " it is a project of which we are very proud .
it is a part of a media , cultural and openness policy on the part of the united states of america launched following the second world war in 1952 . it is thus 40 years old .
in lebanon it has been given a new dimension and is distinguished by the relationship between the american embassy in beirut and the regional english language expert john tork , who lives in amman . "

the " towards a contemporary arab theology " conference concluded at the maronite patriarchal clerical school - ghazir . the conference has lasted 3 days under the patronage of cardinal mar nasrallah butrus safir .
in the first session , which was led by archbishop antoine nabil al-andari , jesuit fr. samir khalil spoke about " the concept of god : an historical and current rapprochement " , in which he stressed that " god created man in mercy , goodness and compassion and christianity is thus the path of unending goodness and love . "
during his contribution , fr naji adalbi spoke about " eastern interpretations of the patriarchal texts " under the spiritual and intellectual authority of the fathers of the church in our arab society , and of " their conspicuous attempts to bring the concepts of christianity closer to the language of the arabs , for example in explaining the meaning of the trinity " .
the second session , which was led by priest jan azzam , included contributions from priest kamil walim ( professor of bible sciences at the faculty of human and theological sciences - al-maadi ) and fr ayub shahwan about " arab interpretations of bible texts " . the third session was led by fr tuma mihanna , in which priest mark swanson ( professor of theology and islamic studies at the lutheran theological college - united states of america ) spoke about " the concept of sacrifice : an historical and theological rapprochement " and fr joseph qazi about " the theology of the holy spirit between christianity and islam " . in the fourth session fr fadil sidarus ( regional director of the jesuit fathers in the east ) and fr mushir basil aun spoke about " the conditions for establishing a contemporary , local , theological , eastern , arab christian message " .
sidarus focused on the fact that the message needed for today was not based on theories but the reality of living in this east . aun stressed , " the creation of a message has to link ideas and languages ,
meaning that the fields of theology , philosophy and language should collectively form the seeds from which an " arab christian " theology would grow . "
in the fifth session , which was led by fr bulus ruhana , archbishop kirllis bustrus spoke about " the theology of jesus christ in christian - islamic dialogue " . he noted the " priority of examining the fortunate points held in common by and the differences in the christian and islamic views of the person of jesus christ " . sheikh muhammad al-hajj ( director of the oriental institute for philosophical and religious studies ) then spoke about " christian theology : an islamic perspective " , in which he dealt with the " the paradox of religious doctrinal dialogue being the most truthful dialogue when its characteristics and mechanisms become clear , far from the position that claims it to be impossible " .
the lecture of archbishop george khidr followed , which discussed " the christian message to contemporary arab man " . he explained the bases of the preaching of the gospel , which is " the meaning of the bible , the person of jesus christ , the cross and the holy trinity " . he called on " arab christians to bear the burdens of their environment and to speak the language of their fellow muslims .
for this language is place and existence . we can only enter into its heritage , enter into love . "
at the end there were some recommendations announced by fr samir khalil , which included :
1 - establish a mechanism to produce specialists in arab eastern theological research " who will formulate a contemporary arab christian theology " .
2 - form an ecumenical committee to unify arab theological terms .
3 - draw up a program for arab theological writings , to fill the gaps in the arab library .
4 - form a committee to pursue these recommendations given that the absence of arab christian thought requires that great concern be demonstrated ; it cannot be neglected any further .

it is the best of times for american jews .
they are united in a way that is perhaps unprecedented .
they have gained powerful new allies from among conservative religious republicans at a time when american support for israel is at its highest levels and membership of american - jewish associations and collectors of donations for them are increasing exponentially .
congress is moving towards increasing aid to israel after associations were able to mobilize about one hundred thousand people , some of whom had come great distances , for example from california , to participate in a mass demonstration in support of the jewish state , which was organized on the 15th of april in front of the headquarters of congress in washington .
with the deterioration in the situation in the middle east , which has reached a level not seen since the 1973 war , american jews believe that israel faces real danger .
their sense of fear is increased by what their leaders are saying about a new wave of anti - semitism in europe .
" reuters " quotes the executive director of the american - israeli public affairs committee ( aipac ) howard core : " american jews strongly believe that this is a battle for the survival of israel " .
american jews represent one of the most powerful and most influential interest groups in the country . their numbers are estimated at between four and six million in the united states , the population of which is reckoned at about 280 million people .
on the other side , american arabs , who number three million , and whose interests are represented by the american - arab institute and other groups , have recently strengthened their standing and influence , and politicians have increasingly begun to address their wishes as well .
but this situation has not been translated into votes in congress .
on the 2nd of may the congress voted on a decision in support of israel with a majority of 352 votes against 21 .
the senate approved a similar decision with a majority of 94 votes against just two .
many analysts have sought an explanation for the american stance of strong support for israel at a time when washington needs the support of arab countries for any potential action against the iraqi president saddam hussein and for president george bush's international war on " terror " .
the american position has increased tension with the united states ' allies .
many who condemn palestinian suicide attacks also condemn the acts of revenge of israeli prime minister ariel sharon and his attempts to weaken palestinian leader yasir arafat .
an opinion survey conducted by the " gallop " institute has shown a slight increase in the number who believe that the united states should support israel , although the total number of such people is no more than 25 % .
it showed that " the vast majority " prefer that the united states does not ally itself with either side , in order that it can be a more sincere and effective mediator .
but there are strong currents that have an impact in other directions .
firstly , there is the fact that israel and its allies in america have succeeded in promoting an idea that echoes well in the united states , namely that palestinian suicide attacks are terrorism and that it is israel's duty to defend itself just as the united states did after the 11 september attacks .
secondly , there are the conservative religious republicans , who from a substantial political force . they have joined some democrats and aipac in stressing that the bush should not put pressure on sharon .
aipac has an effective site on the internet and possess the ability to formulate its message in a way that is appropriate to every party that approaches it . it also follows closely what is published by the media and protests strongly at everything it views as biased towards the palestinians .
frank rich , a jewish writer for the new york times , believes that the camp supporting israel has gone beyond reasonable limits .
he wrote in his column on saturday , " the criteria for what is considered proper dialogue in political terms have been narrowed to the extent that american leaders , whatever their inclinations , appear to be in a race to submit to american jewish pressures . "
president of the american arab institute james zughbi notes encouraging trends for the pressure groups that it represents . he notes that 82 members of congress voted against the decision supporting israel , which is a record , and that 35 members of the chamber criticized the lack of balance in the decision .
( reuters )
saudi crown prince , first deputy prime minister and commander of the national guard abdallah bin abd al-aziz explained that he had spent many hours familiarizing president george bush with the reality of the conditions in the middle east , but he indicated that his general impression of the american president was positive .
in an interview with the saudi okaz newspaper he dealt with his first meeting with bush last month saying , " i saw a completely different man to the one i had imagined prior to my meeting him , in fact he was not what i was expecting at all . he has human feelings , he listens , discusses and talks cogently , but he was not wholly aware of the reality of conditions in the region , especially the conditions of the palestinian people . "
he clarified that bush slept at 9:30 pm after having watched local news and only read a few lines of reports written about the middle east in the morning .
" for this reason i saw that it was my duty to spend as much time as possible with him in order to inform him of the facts directly without an intermediary . this is why i spent over five hours with him . i explained to him , informed him and personally handed over to him pictures of the tragedies in the palestinian territories embodying the facts presented there in sound and picture on the video cassette that i handed to him . "
the saudi crown prince , who had threatened to review the kingdom 's relations with the united states last august , in light of what he viewed as washington 's biased policies towards israel , added that he wanted to give bush this explanation without an intermediary .
asked about bush 's response he replied , " i saw in his eyes surprise and astonishment as well as deep sadness after he was shown these terrible and upsetting pictures . "
i said to him you are the president of the largest and most powerful state in the world and you have established political principles and values that focus on human rights and the application of justice . you have the ability to move along the path of a solution , justice and peace (...) i saw in american president george bush junior a man with noble moral characteristics . he is sincere , brave and emotional . these are positive signs that show the potential for him to realize the just demands of the palestinian issue and the palestinian people . "
bush had said that he had established a strong relationship following five hours of talks with prince abdallah , whose country was washington 's principal ally in the gulf region .
officials from both sides reported that the two leaders had agreed to coordinate their efforts to end the palestinian - israeli crisis , resume the peace process and establish a palestinian state that could live in security and harmony with israel .
prince abdallah was asked about bilateral relations between the two countries . he answered that he had not wished to discuss this matter but that bush had himself raised it . " he told me that the saudi people harbored feelings of hatred against me (...) i told him that this was the case with all peoples of the world . "
he noted that bush had laughed and told him , " yes , you may be right . but i want to stress to you , highness prince abdallah , that relations over 60 years between the kingdom and the united states of america cannot be changed by a president or an administration because they are firm , solid strategic relations . "
the saudi crown prince expressed the belief that bush " would move in the right direction on the basis of justice , which had long been the criteria of american foreign policy . "

following the difference of opinion between him and the american administration in respect of the american accusations that cuba is trying to acquire biological weapons , which washington reiterated yesterday , former american president jimmy carter found himself in a contradiction with cuban leader fidel castro in terms of the concept of democracy and human rights .
in a " friendly " meeting between the communist leader and carter , who is on the first visit by an american president to this country since 1959 , during which they exchanged handshakes , smiles and expressions of admiration ,
hours before the meeting of the american deputy secretary of state for south asia , christina roca , and indian officials including minister foreign affairs jaswant singh , whilst she was in new delhi on tuesday as part of efforts to avoid another war between the nuclear enemies of india and pakistan , armed men , believed to be islamic extremists , mounted an attack on a military barracks in the indian - controlled region of kashmir . 30 civilians and soldiers were killed in an exchange of fire , including the three attackers
the israeli army yesterday assassinated the head of palestinian general intelligence in halhul , kahlid abu khiran , and his deputy , ahmad abd al-aziz al-zamahrah , in an attack on the town , which is situated north of the town of hebron , the aim of which was to pursue and detain wanted activists .
israeli military sources clarified that the two officers who were killed were armed and in a building surrounded by soldiers .
they tried to flee but were killed .
the army detained three palestinians in the attack , which continued for several hours .
14 others were detained in similar incursions in some of the villages under self - rule in the same area .
italian prime minister silvio berlusconi stated yesterday that italy could receive between one and three of the 13 palestinians exiled by israel to cyprus last week , when the european union arrives at a definition of their legal status , but some parties in the government coalition oppose taking any of them .
he said that italy could host " one , two or three - there is no difference so long as the arrangements are the same " .
he added , " we have many appropriate and safe dedicated reception centers . "
more than 21,700 troops from the united states , singapore and thailand are taking part in the 21st round of the " cobra gold " maneuvers , one of the most important annual multilateral maneuvers , which are taking place with american participation in the asia - pacific ocean region .
the united states ' ambassador to thailand , darryl johnson , said at the ceremony of the start of the maneuvers at the utaphao sea and air base that these maneuvers include counter - terrorist training for the first time .
he added , " the world is not as it was before the 11 september attacks . " he noted , " multilateral maneuvers like cobra gold are essential for us all to be able to frustrate those terrorists and eliminate their networks in the region and the world . "
in a statement the american embassy clarified that the maneuvers bring together the soldiers of three countries in operations that focus on peacekeeping and supporting inhabitants . they will allow the united states " to prove its commitment to provide support for the security of its friends and allies in the asia - pacific ocean region " .
the thai army reported that the maneuvers would continue until the 28th of may and would be conducted in the center and east of thailand . twice the number of soldiers involved last year will take part .
amongst those involved are 14 thousand american , 7700 thai and 70 singaporean soldiers . this is in addition to 105 aircraft ( 73 american and 32 thai ) , six american battleships and 11 thai naval vessels .
18 countries were invited to attend the maneuvers as observers , compared with four two years ago . they include : australia , bangladesh , brunei , cambodia , china , fiji , france , india , indonesia , japan , malaysia , mongolia , the philippines , russia , south korea , sri lanka , tonga and vietnam .
in kuala lumpur the newspapers reported that malaysian prime minister mahathir mohamad , who is in washington this week on a visit to demonstrate the improvement in relations with the united states , would sign an agreement to combat terrorism with president george bush .
the new streets times newspaper quoted the malaysian minister of foreign affairs syed hamid albar as saying that mahathir and bush would sign a declaration combating international terrorism during the working visit that the malaysian official is conducting , which will last for four days .
mahathir was an eloquent critic of the west a few years ago .
relations between malaysia and the united states became tense when the american administration declared its opposition to the isolation and imprisonment of mahatir 's rival , former vice president anwar ibrahim in 1998 .
mahatir received praise from washington , however , for the way he has dealt with those suspected of being islamist activists since 11 september .
director of the federal bureau of investigation ( fbi ) robert mueller described the working relationship between his office and the malaysian authorities as being a vital part of its efforts across the world to investigate terrorist acts and funding networks .
in washington indonesian minister of defense matori abdul djalil confirmed that indonesia would not allow the deployment of american forces on its territory to help combat terror . but it was keen to repair military relations , which were cut in 1999 .
following his meeting with the american defense minister donald rumsfield he said , " the response is no because this is not our foreign policy and we still trust the capability of our national police and army to confront these dangers . "
washington cut its military links with jakarta in 1999 following bloody incidents in east timor when the inhabitants of the region agreed to separate from indonesia in a referendum .
neighboring states , such as the philippines , have allowed american forces to train their armies to combat terrorism .
rumsfield said that human rights violations had led to these restrictions and " we now believe that it is time to reform them fundamentally " .

the arab program for human rights activists , a non - governmental rights organization based in cairo , has accused the " old guard " in syria of " fabricating charges " against tens of oppositionists out of fear of the possibility of " their being called to account " . this coincided with the start of the trial of habib isa and walid al-buni , who were stopped along with tens of oppositionists in the summer of 2001 , and accused " of aggressing against the constitution , of incitement to armed insurgency and of broadcasting news from abroad " .
a statement issued by the rights organization , a copy of which was received by france press , said , " the old guard in the syrian government is fully aware that relaxation is contrary to their interests , as is the opening of the files on corruption and suppression , and that they may be called to account by the syrian people . for this reason they have fabricated charges against tens of oppositionists " the most prominent of which are riyadh saif , mamun al-humusi , riyadh al-turk , arif dalilah , habib isa and habib salih . it said , " at a time when the arab peoples need sincere persons from among them to confront the massacres experienced by the palestinian people (...) the syrian authorities reward the activists by extending their detention for an eighth month in succession . " it noted that the detentions were " a punishment against them for their attempt to activate the role of syrian civil society , which has been maltreated for thirty years . everyone rejoiced when president bashar al-asad came in view of his reformist program and attempt to create a formula by which civil society could be re - activated . "
it concluded by saying that the arab program for human rights activists " would not stop demanding that the pages of detentions for reason of opinion be turned and all forms of exceptional justice abolished " .
deputies mamum al-humusi and riyadh saif were tried in march and april before an ordinary court and were each sentenced to five years in prison after they were found guilty " of working to change the constitution by illegal means " .
the state security court yesterday began the trial of press spokesman for the jamal al-atasi forum , habib isa , aged 55 , and member of the committees for revitalizing civil society walid al-buni , aged 38 , who are charged with " aggressing against the constitution " , following nine months of detention .
with the exception of the syrian arab news agency ( sana ) correspondent journalists and diplomats were not allowed to attend the session .
lawyer anwar al-buni , who is defending the pair , said , " the first thing we asked of the judge was for the case to be heard in public and that friends and family be allowed to attend . "
another lawyer , hasan abd al-azim , stressed , " this is a right because we believe that the presence of the syrian arab news agency and the defense lawyer does not make the trial public . "
he added that the defense was awaiting the court 's response " in order to decide whether to boycott the trials or not " .
the court has set the 12th of june as the date for the next session for al-buni 's trial and the 19th of june for that of isa .

the american fox news television network revealed on monday night that traces of explosive materials had been found on a truck rented by two israelis seized in the state of washington last week . the american ministry of defense , the pentagon , was meanwhile evacuated on account of an odor of a chemical material that transpired to be weed killer . the authorities feared that a nuclear plant might be the subject of a terrorist threat on the 4th of july , america 's national day celebration .
the network explained that the driver of the truck and the passenger accompanying him , both of whom are israeli nationals , confirmed that they were transporting pieces of furniture .
police stopped the truck last tuesday for exceeding the speed limit in the town of oak harbor , near an american naval base .
the driver and passenger were later detained for violating the immigration laws .
an inspection of the truck by trained dogs found traces of two materials : the explosive tnt on the speed control lever and rdx , which is used for military purposes , on the steering wheel .
the authorities in washington refused to comment on the subject .
the network quoted official sources as saying that an investigation is currently underway and that no other charge had been directed against the driver and passenger .
pentagon spokeswoman cheryl irwin said that a thousand people were evacuated from the building at about two o ' clock as part of a protective measure after sensor equipment , which was installed after the 11 september attacks that targeted it and the twin towers of the world trade center , detected the odor of a chemical substance that transpired to be an industrial cleaner for killing weeds and removing paint .
she said , " the sensor equipment detected what it thought was the odor of an organic chemical substance (...) they are carrying out work beneath this area in steam pipes , using a substance for removing paint . this is what they believe caused the odor . "
france press quoted an american official , who asked to remain anonymous , as saying that the american intelligence agencies had become aware of an " unconfirmed " threat that might target a nuclear plant on the 4th of july .
the credibility of this information was " debatable " but " we treat all threats seriously " .
the washington times newspaper reported that the intelligence agencies were informed last week that an " islamic terrorist " group is preparing for an attack either against the three mile island nuclear plant in pennsylvania in the east of the country , or against another nuclear plant in the north east of the united states .
an official confirmed the accuracy of the published information , pointing out that the intelligence agencies usually receive threats relating to the most prominent holidays , but that the warning of an attack on the 4th of july was not the result of the interrogation of abu zubaydah , the al-qaeda official detained in pakistan last march .

italian prime minister silvio berlusconi stated yesterday that italy could receive between one and three of the 13 palestinians exiled by israel to cyprus last week , when the european union arrives at a definition of their legal status , but some parties in the government coalition oppose taking any of them .
he said that italy could host " one , two or three - there is no difference so long as the arrangements are the same " .
he added , " we have many appropriate and safe dedicated reception centers . "
the information reported by the italian " la stampa " newspaper said that these places could be a flat in the suburbs of rome or a municipal headquarters in tuscany .
it mentioned that a law going back to 1956 allows for the organization of special surveillance of persons believed to constitute a danger to public order .
israeli describes the 13 palestinians as terrorists , which is the pretext used by the lombardia confederation ( the northern confederation ) to justify its refusal to host the palestinian exiles in italy .
the deputy speaker in the italian senate roberto caldiroli , executive member of the confederation , said , " i strongly oppose the idea of receiving even one of those palestinians . "
in return for his stance supporting the reception of a number of palestinians , berlusconi wants italy to host the middle east peace conference , which is still at the planning stages .
he acknowledged , " the time is not yet right to begin preparations for the negotiating table . "
in larnaca , tourists reported that they do not feel relaxed at their being close to the " flamingo " hotel , in which the 13 palestinians are staying .
referring to the smart hotel overlooking the sea , british tourist george dodd said , " we know that they are staying at that hotel and i cannot say that we feel relaxed at their presence and all this number of policemen around us . "
he added , " i have often stayed in this hotel and i would have left immediately had they arrived whilst i was there (...) if they remain there for a long time , it will harm tourism on the island . "
the cyprus government expressed its wish for the exiles to leave by wednesday but the european union had postponed taking a decision on the countries that will take them to later this week .
officials in the union announced that the six countries , belgium , ireland , italy , greece , spain and portugal , are prepared to take them .
talking to the guards stationed on the roof of the hotel , german tourist paul hoffman said , " i think it strange to surround the place with all these security procedures .
i go to the beach everyday and when i see the soldiers on the roof i do not feel entirely relaxed (...) i believe that it could have been possible to choose another place for them . "
the 13 palestinians are not allowed to leave their rooms on the fourth floor of the five - floor hotel except at meal times and under heavy guard .
policemen and special forces officers wearing civilian clothes are deployed in the hotel lobby and on top of the roof .
a british tourist laying her towel on the beach meters from the hotel entrance said , " had i known that they were coming here i would have gone to pavos (...) do you think i like everyone watching me ?
(...) everyone here is under observation these days . "
the cypriot authorities allow the 13 palestinians to contact officials and some other persons .
yesterday a journalist called from the roof of a neighboring building to one of the exiles , who had appeared on the balcony of the room in which he is staying at the hotel , asking him for his name . the palestinian replied , " i cannot talk . "
the representative of the palestinian authority in cyprus , samir abu ghazalah , sent food to the exiles , including stuffed vine leaves , milk and cakes .

amman - from basil rafayaah :
in a defense submitted by her to the jordanian state security court yesterday , former member of the jordanian chamber of deputies toujan faisal criticized jordanian prime minister ali abu al-ragheb and accused him of " distorting jordan 's image at home and abroad " and confirmed that he had offered her " a bribe in return for her stopping the criticism directed against him " in the sitting preceding the ruling in this case , which will be announced tomorrow .
she said that she was " completely innocent of the charges of broadcasting news inside jordan and abroad that contained falsehood and threatened the authority and reputation of the state , insulted the respect of its personnel and incited to disturbances and the committing of crimes " . she added , " throughout her life she had defended the jordanian people and its fundamental issues , foremost of which is to combat all forms of corruption and to confront those who betray the trust with which they have been charged . "
she believed that abu al-ragheb " was involved in distorting and insulting jordan 's image after he issued tens of temporary laws from which he personally benefited " - a reference to the decision issued by the government which increased vehicle insurances fees by 100 % at the beginning of this year .
she reiterated that the prime minister " had personally benefited from the decision , which aims to compensate the insurance sector for losses it had experienced " and that " increasing insurance prices had helped the al-yarmuk insurance company , in which abu al-ragheb owns a share to overcome its losses " . abu al-ragheb wholly denies this .
faisal has been on trial since the 16th of last april for criticisms she directed at the government via the qatari aljazeera satellite channel and e - mail . she called on king abdallah ii bin al-hussein last march to dismiss the government and accused it of corruption .
jordanian officials have branded her " a liar " and demanded that she provide evidence of her claims .
she is mounting her own defense after the defense team withdrew from the case in protest at the court 's refusal to call abu al-ragheb to testify before it .
she asked , " what does it mean when the prime minister refuses to appear before the court ? " she said , " he believes himself to be above the law . his position constitutes an attack on the authority of the state and the judiciary . "
in testimony given before the court at the beginning of this month , former jordanian prime minister abd al-karim al-kabariti believed , " what toujan has brought before the court amounts to constructive criticism - it should not be counted as an insult to , attack on or distortion of jordan 's reputation . "
in her defense faisal revealed that abu al-ragheb had offered her a bribe in return for her ending her criticisms of him . " the bribe included three cars and a sum of money the value of which he left me to determine . i responded that i refused this , which has led to my trial . "
faisal , who became the first jordanian female member of the chamber of deputies in 1993 , is facing six months ' to three years ' imprisonment if convicted .
she accused the public prosecutor to the court , muhanad hijazi , " of lying and challenged him to prove that her articles were untrue " .
she explained that she had resorted to making statements to the satellite channels and over the internet because she was banned from writing in the jordan press .
she read her defense in a loud voice and sharp tone . the chief judge of the court col. tail al-raqqad interrupted her repeatedly and warned her that she must stop " insulting and libeling the court , the public prosecution and the government " .
jordanian officials believe that toujan 's trial has come after many years of her recklessly making charges against and slandering the government , which has greatly harmed jordan 's image and its democratic experiment . observers , however , say that toujan is a prisoner of opinion and that her trial is evidence of a sharp downturn in freedom of opinion and expression in jordan , which ultimately aims to prevent her from standing for the deputies election to be held in the country at the end of next september .
it is not a mistake when we admit , albeit with pain , that the palestinian intifada has , one and a half years since it began , lost its military battle against israel .
nor is it a mistake when , in response , we reject the logic that sees in the results of the intifada a catastrophe by all standards .
the palestinian people have left bleeding .
there is no family without a martyr , wounded , detainee or disabled member .
there is no city , town or village that has not tasted death and fear .
there is no economic facility that can stand on its own two feet .
there is no civilian or military institution that has not been ruined .
the intifada has not succeeded in causing serious ruptures in israeli society .
sharon has not fallen . in fact a worse alternative in netanyahu has appeared .
the army has seen no major divisions .
but no one has surrendered .
but sharon 's project has not passed away ( irrespective of whether it was the destruction or elimination of the authority , breaking the spirit of resistance , realizing the transfer of people or creating a palestinian alternative to arafat ) .
but the world has begun to agree to a genuine independent palestinian state .
but the purely security treatments have proven to be fruitless .
the palestinian civil war has not taken place .
but israel 's " democratic " image has been shaken to the depths , even among its partisan supporters .
but european and american public opinion to some extent now feels the injustice inflicted on the palestinians more .
but islamic - christian unity in palestine has been consolidated .
is that not much ?
* * *
after chairman yasir arafat has recovered his freedom and the israeli campaign has begun to retreat , the palestinian issue is entering a new stage , one which requires a harsh , critical stance , followed by a different strategy of struggle .
first , we need to conduct a comprehensive inventory to evaluate the results of the intifada in all its phases , at different levels and in the different spheres on which it impacts .
secondly , we need a new palestinian charter , one which defines the phased program for the struggle : israeli withdrawal to the borders of 4 june 1967 , the establishment of an independent palestinian state with its capital in east jerusalem , establishment of the right to return and the dismantling of settlements .
this charter would include a condemnation of every palestinian action that went outside the national consensus , whether in respect of operations inside the 1948 territory or which harm civilians , whatever the considerations .
thirdly , it would require that the authority be re - established .
there would be no more corruption , waste , autocracy or proliferation of or contradiction between agencies as its characteristic features . nor would its penetration by american and israeli intelligence be " normal " , without there being accountability or cleansing of the ranks .
if the call to " reform " the authority comes from the american administration , and for its own aims , this does not mean that no reforms should be carried out , in fear of being seen to submit to " american pressures " .
is it not fundamentally shameful that the demand for transparency should be american instead of being exclusively an arab democratic demand ?
* * *
we have lost the military facet of the struggle , albeit for a long time .
there is a need to catch our breath in order to conduct a review , a need that should take precedence over any slogan , no matter how brilliant or eye - catching .
but palestine has entered the world 's heart .
he who was once considered a loss , by being raised on the cross , was the same person to appear triumphant .
and palestine , with its cross , will be victorious over the barbarians .
george nasif .
there is no place in pure democratic logic for an agreement to a settlement candidate , to recommend a candidate , or for a collective withdrawal of candidates in the interest of a principle of congruence , in the manner that is today proposed in the by - election battle in al-matan , irrespective of whether the motive therefor is the wish of religious authorities or the efforts of political leaders to avoid the cup of victory and defeat .
with this logic the oppositionist camp risks putting itself in a dangerous , fundamental and basic contradiction , one that will be recorded against it and will cause it to fall into moral error before the authority , even should it win in the elections as an opposition candidate .
this has nothing to do with an election battle in which oppositionists may find a " pragmatic " arena that will lead them to believe the justification for a more obliging attitude towards principles , as this is represented in the issue of democracy by the plurality and variety of candidates even under among oppositionists themselves .
thus the religious authorities driving in this direction , albeit with good intent , expose the oppositionist camp with their provision to some of its wings , to a dangerous error , one that cannot be tolerated .
for so long as the oppositionists have adopted the by - election battle as the ground for a political and democratic struggle with the authority , which constitutes the best , most successful and most important means in terms of its yield in the context of the domestic democratic struggle , any retreat from the battle in its multi - candidacy form would constitute a dangerous withdrawal for this camp , which is morally superior to the authority despite the imbalance in powers imposed by the political reality from which the authority draws its strength .
its superiority has only been achieved by the accumulation of rounds and the ongoing , daily recording of the conduct by an authority of ill - repute in the field of democracy and in the fertile errors in the sphere of violations of liberties .
raising this dangerous aspect of oppositionist behavior , which , in some of its wings , tends towards accounts that are mostly personal and political , is imposed by the fact that submission to the logic of abandoning principles , which is inherently part and parcel of being an opposition , and its main support , will cause it to abandon on other occasions far more serious principles .
what applies to oppositionists who lie under the roof of the " qarnat shahwan forum " applies equally to more fundamental oppositionists , such as brigadier michel aun .
for the " qarnat forum " enjoys an unusual flexibility in this form of agreement and settlement after its pillars were unable to put forward a candidate in the forum 's name under regional pretexts that could not hide the structural weaknesses that continues to tarnish this gathering , which succeeded in seeking shade under the bikirki roof in respect of the issue of syrian influence but was then shaken to its depths when it entered the maze of its first electoral test , which appeared to provide an outlet for personal and self - centered accounts .
there is also , however , an unusual ambiguity in the stance of brigadier aun in supporting a candidate when his firm initial position is to boycott absolutely every election conducted in lebanon in the shadow of syrian influence .
in light of these two indicators the opposition are running a grave risk in exposing the principles to a game of pragmatics .
for principles are not to be played with except in light of major changes that permit a review .
so long as part of the opposition are convinced that the election game is an effective means for democratic struggle then they must continue down that path without turning back .
and so long as another part of that opposition are convinced that a boycott is a weapon for not acknowledging foreign influence , then they must not change their position unless the circumstances relating to lebanon 's broad reality change and not under any other circumstantial considerations .
in both cases the opposition is governed by democracy , among its ranks and in its decisions , both in terms of small political dues or major , more fundamental ones .
in no case can the opposition agree on major principles and then drop them for a by - election battle , for if they do the meaning and purpose of this battle will be lost as a result of selfish and self - centered passions .
something of democracy has begun to afflict the opposition and there is no scope to deny or conceal the fact .
so have the behavior of the authority leaked out to the enemy camp , causing them , in turn , to assemble winter and summer at the same table ?
nabil bumunsif .
today , the 15th of may , coincides with the founding of the state of israel .
there is no need for us , against the background of this political chaff from the ocean to the gulf , to form demonstrations , make speeches and issue statements . for 54 years we have been reaping defeats and disasters and mastering the art of demonstrations , speeches and statements .
let us sit and think for once , and make some simple comparisons :
* first , a tripartite arab summit of pivotal weight concludes with what is almost an " appeasing " declaration condemning the violence in response to american demands .
implicitly this means that it condemns acts of " martyrdom " , which have been the backbone of the intifada . the israeli response followed quickly during a meeting of the likud central committee , which voted with a majority of 59 % of the vote against the establishment of a " palestinian state " .
it may be too early to seek mercy for ariel sharon following the return of the wolf , benyamin netanyahu , to the surface . but we must at least consider the words of king abdallah , who said that the sharm al-sheikh meeting discussed a mechanism for providing security to israel in return for providing an independent state to the palestinians . what security are we discussing when we face the impossibility of a palestinian state ? !
* secondly , yasir arafat revealed nothing when he said that the likud decision constituted the demolition of the oslo accord . he was preceded by israeli ministers and analysts who mounted a strong campaign against this decision . he did , however , reveal a new facet of the concessions when he told the "..." television station to the letter : " we hope to see an independent palestinian state alongside a jewish israeli state " .
the acceptance of the " jewishness " of the israeli state means that the " right of return " is dropped , which amounts to a free payment , one without recompense , at a time when the tone of political decisions in tel aviv shifts towards abrogating any text that speaks of the palestinian state , towards a continuation of the aggression to establish " greater israel " .
* thirdly , we must certainly recall the decision of the arab summit in beirut , which put forward an " arab peace initiative " , which was applauded by many in the world , against the background of relief that the arab states had acquired a vision for peaceful settlement . but what we must recall more ( on the grounds that we are a nation of the forgetful and may , in fact , have forgotten ) that sharon 's government responded to this initiative with the " protective wall " operation , which is yet to be completed .
* fourthly , we must recall the israeli atmospherics that preceded the holding of the madrid conference and which accompanied its workings 11 years ago . " joy and satisfaction " were the main features of israeli feeling at the time because the arabs had " finally " shown a desire to make peace with israel and give it middle eastern legitimacy . but we must note that the mere acceptance by israel of the idea of peace now is not only a cause of joy and satisfaction from the ocean to the gulf but is one of the primary arab aspirations . if this is not the case then why do the arab states continue to express affection , good intent and peace initiatives whilst the israelis are hung up on policies of aggression , expansion and violence ?
* fifthly , the jordanian monarch says that he bore an urgent ( note the word urgent ) message to washington saying that the region was in need of foreign intervention to resolve the israeli - palestinian dispute and that washington must replace its policy of " managing the dispute " to one of " ending the dispute " .. . this urgent message calls us to recall the time when the arabs opposed any american intervention in the dispute out of the fear of bias towards israel , as if that bias has now ended !
* sixthly , the united states of america 's share of arab condemnation , angry statements , accusations and insults parallels that of israel . but this is one thing and seeking america as sole authority to intervene and impose a solution is something else .
how ?
only god knows !
* * *
of course , there is no need for any of us to scream : where were we and where are we now , because where we were has led us to where we are .
how ?
think about it a little !
the opening page of yesterday 's haaretz criticized the decision taken by the likud central committee opposing the establishment of a palestinian state , describing it as " useless " and containing an " historical fallacy " .
it wrote , " the decision of the likud central committee contradicts the policy of the prime minister to date .
even binyamin netanyahu himself undertook to implement the oslo agreements in the 1996 head of government elections .
within a short time of coming to power he signed the wye agreement . his government also ordered the evacuation of parts of hebron .
whilst he was prime minister the knesset approved the " golan law " , so that he could demonstrate at the end of his term that he had tried to hold talks with syria and appear to be prepared to offer major concessions .
the details of the experimental talks with syria were revealed by none other than netanyahu 's rival ariel sharon , who attacked the likud government from the right , as is his custom , until he was elected prime minister .
it was sharon who attacked prime minister ishaq shamir for taking part in the madrid conference and it was he who sabotaged the meeting of the likud central committee in 1990 when he hijacked the microphone to impede the voting .
today , because he sits in the prime minister 's chair and bears responsibilities , he uses a different , more ambiguous language .
he has demanded that the party 's central committee not negotiate the matter of the palestinian state at present in order not to harm the political efforts and in order to allow the government to conduct its business .
but the committee did not support him , with about 60 % of its members voting against him . "
it concluded , " the voting of the likud central committee harms the international standing of israel , but , in reality , the vote carries no importance , neither political nor otherwise .
when the time is right and the palestinians come to the negotiating table , there is a suspicion that the head of the government in israel may not , like those before him , try to reach an agreement with them , including the establishment of a state . "
yesterday " maariv " mentioned that sharon had sent letters reassuring the americans and his partners in the government , the labor party ministers , that his policies would not change following the likud vote against the establishment of a palestinian state .
it quoted a speech that he had made to members of the likud bloc in the knesset in which he had said , " i hold the central committee and the bloc in esteem , but responsibility for what happens falls on my shoulders . this is a heavy burden . two thirds of the public elected me so that i could think and take decisions .
i promised before the elections that i would bring about peace and security . this is what guides me and , so that there will be no mistake , this is what will guide me in the future . "
he confirmed that there would be no elections before the 28th of october 2003 .
until that time he will continue to work as usual without the interests of groups or individuals being served .
elsewhere , " yediot ahronot " quoted parts of the speech given by sharon to the knesset , in which he presented the escalation on the northern borders . he pointed out that hizbollah in the north were using an advanced weapon that they had not used before .
he said that israel would not sit idly by when " terrorist acts " against the inhabitants of israel in the north would return .
he added , " we see increasing iranian activity among the arabs of israel . "
randah haidar .
on the 14th of may this year the iranians celebrated the 110th anniversary of al-mirza al-shirazi , the strongest religious authority in iran at that time , issuing his famous fatwa prohibiting the use of tobacco . the people obeyed and threw the water pipes off the roofs of their buildings into the streets , in what was known as the " tobacco uprising " , thereby causing the british authorities to submit to the volition of the iranians .
this was the first public confrontation between the iranian clerics and the government and was followed by numerous others at different stages , in which the iranians mostly submitted to what the religious authorities , who had left the narrow domain of personal jurisprudence for the public arena and major interests , said .
this does not mean that the men of religion , prior to this , had been far removed from politics and the affairs of government , but their interaction with the political arena had not been united . some of them had supported some of the kings whilst others kept themselves well away from the government .
but what al-mirza al-shirazi did was the first public clash .
there are many studies and views in the history of contemporary iran that analyze the phenomenon of the men of religion and their place in iranian society , and whether they constitute a social class or not .
studies that adopt the marxist methodology of analysis agree that they , namely the men of religion , form a class alongside the other classes of society in iran . . . without this meaning that this description applies to clerics in other societies , in particular outside the domain of the shiite sect .
since the safavid period religious scholars have come to hold great influence in iran . this class has come to have social status , rights and immunity in comparison with the other classes .
in fact the legitimacy of the political authority was , to a great extent , linked to the support of men of religion and their backing of it .
in the safavid period their political strength grew after they grew closer to the safavid " shahs " , who relied on the scholars as one of the pillars of their rule . but many of them removed themselves from government and turned to the teaching of the religious sciences alone .
iranian religious scholars then split into more than one group . some believed in the possibility of the establishment of a government representing god 's shadow on earth , thereby allowing support for the monarchy embodying that rule . others adopted the view that it could only be established by jurists . still others opposed the intervention of men of religion in politics .
during the qajarite and pahlavi periods the first group were active . they represented a minority , one that was opposed by another minority , namely those who wanted government to be established by the scholars . most continued to exercise the doctrine of dissimulation and did not believe it permissible to intervene in political matters .
however the revolution in february 1979 embodied the rise of those calling for the establishment of islamic government . a republican regime was established based on the clerics and supervised by a religious authority known as the al-wali al-faqih , which increased radiance of this group and thereby raised their social standing and the respect offered them by the majority .
the clerics would walk in the streets and the people would bow before them putting their right hand on their chest in respect , as is the social custom in iran .
the electorate looked at the pictures of candidates and preferred the turbaned candidate to the effendi .
but the presence of a cleric in the position of an advisor , guide and demagogue changed him in positions of government and executive positions .
for he could not remain as he was and nor were the people prepared to forgive him when he slipped up .
and many iranian clerics have confessed to making mistakes when they came to official positions .
do you think that if al-mirza al-shirazi returned today and issued a fatwa calling for a boycott of american goods , for example . . . how many iranians would throw them in the streets as they threw the water pipes more than a century ago ?
salim mashkur .
there is no need for us , against the background of this political chaff from the ocean to the gulf , to form demonstrations , make speeches and issue statements . for 54 years we have been reaping defeats and disasters and mastering the art of demonstrations , speeches and statements .
let us sit and think for once , and make some simple comparisons :
* first , a tripartite arab summit of pivotal weight concludes with what is almost an " appeasing " declaration condemning the violence in response to american demands .
implicitly this means that it condemns acts of " martyrdom " , which have been the backbone of the intifada . the israeli response followed quickly during a meeting of the likud central committee , which voted with a majority of 59 % of the vote against the establishment of a " palestinian state " .
it may be too early to seek mercy for ariel sharon following the return of the wolf , benyamin netanyahu , to the surface . but we must at least consider the words of king abdallah , who said that the sharm al-sheikh meeting discussed a mechanism for providing security to israel in return for providing an independent state to the palestinians . what security are we discussing when we face the impossibility of a palestinian state ? !
* secondly , yasir arafat revealed nothing when he said that the likud decision constituted the demolition of the oslo accord . he was preceded by israeli ministers and analysts who mounted a strong campaign against this decision . he did , however , reveal a new facet of the concessions when he told the "..." television station to the letter : " we hope to see an independent palestinian state alongside a jewish israeli state " .
the acceptance of the " jewishness " of the israeli state means that the " right of return " is dropped , which amounts to a free payment , one without recompense , at a time when the tone of political decisions in tel aviv shifts towards abrogating any text that speaks of the palestinian state , towards a continuation of the aggression to establish " greater israel " .
* thirdly , we must certainly recall the decision of the arab summit in beirut , which put forward an " arab peace initiative " , which was applauded by many in the world , against the background of relief that the arab states had acquired a vision for peaceful settlement . but what we must recall more ( on the grounds that we are a nation of the forgetful and may , in fact , have forgotten ) that sharon 's government responded to this initiative with the " protective wall " operation , which is yet to be completed .
* fourthly , we must recall the israeli atmospherics that preceded the holding of the madrid conference and which accompanied its workings 11 years ago . " joy and satisfaction " were the main features of israeli feeling at the time because the arabs had " finally " shown a desire to make peace with israel and give it middle eastern legitimacy . but we must note that the mere acceptance by israel of the idea of peace now is not only a cause of joy and satisfaction from the ocean to the gulf but is one of the primary arab aspirations . if this is not the case then why do the arab states continue to express affection , good intent and peace initiatives whilst the israelis are hung up on policies of aggression , expansion and violence ?
* fifthly , the jordanian monarch says that he bore an urgent ( note the word urgent ) message to washington saying that the region was in need of foreign intervention to resolve the israeli - palestinian dispute and that washington must replace its policy of " managing the dispute " to one of " ending the dispute " ... this urgent message calls us to recall the time when the arabs opposed any american intervention in the dispute out of the fear of bias towards israel , as if that bias has now ended !
* sixthly , the united states of america 's share of arab condemnation , angry statements , accusations and insults parallels that of israel . but this is one thing and seeking america as sole authority to intervene and impose a solution is something else .
how ?
only god knows !
* * *
of course , there is no need for any of us to scream : where were we and where are we now , because where we were has led us to where we are .
how ?
think about it a little !
a french study published in the may edition of the american journal of neuroscience has concluded that nicotine reduces the production of new nerve cells .
researchers at the national institute for health conducted experiments on mice in an area of the brain known as the dentate gyrus , which produces new nerve cells throughout life and helps in the processes of learning and memory .
in contrast to the stimulant effect of nicotine on the perceptive functions , it appears that during a period of stopping smoking many smokers undergo changes to the learning and memory mechanisms .
this leads to the belief that long - term exposure to nicotine has a negative effect on the brain and perception .
in an attempt to explain this , which , as yet has no biological basis , the french researchers decided to study the resilience of a specific area in the brains of mice .
the analysis of data collected on these rodents showed that the consumption of nicotine reduced production of nerve cells .
during the experiments , which continued for 42 days , the number of new nerve cells was reduced by half among the group of mice that took nicotine and those that took a relative dose determined by the researchers ( 0.04 milligrams / kilogram )
as the nicotine dose increased the number of new cells decreased .
those who conducted the study stressed that the amount of nicotine given to the mice is close , in relative terms , to that consumed by smokers .
it should be noted that research demonstrating the existence of a negative effect for nicotine on the brain is small . some even speak of nicotine having a positive effect on the nerves and consequently on nerve cells .
the circle of associates demanding that the authority conduct fundamental reforms to the administrative structure is widening around palestinian leader yasir arafat .
the most prominent event in this regard was the resignation of the minister for parliamentary affairs , nabil amr , who is one of yasir arafat 's confidantes and a person of diplomatic experience in a unique experimental location as an ambassador in moscow .
he told " figaro " last week that in the last years of the life of the soviet union he had witnessed how systems collapse from the inside , and he does not want to see this repeated in palestine .
in turn , abu mazin , the number two in the liberation organization and in power , called for immediate and urgent reforms to the political and administrative structures .
voices said that it was not the time for reforms because that was to meet with american demands and the statements of george bush .
in addition , the palestinian leader is facing what is his and the palestinians ' most difficult and fundamental confrontation , so why bring up the matter of corruption and mismanagement now and weaken his position in the face of his rivals and enemies ?
one can go further than this , but only as part of a political logic that is not subject to any manners or niceties . we could say : is it not possible that the talk about reform and preventing corruption represents the trojan horse on which arafat will be borne , so that he can be taken outside effective power and become no more than a historical leader , one who consults but is not consulted , who listens but is not obeyed , who is honored but not respected .
in politics there are many possibilities and the facts are complex .
amidst this disastrous confusion , in which ramallah is drowning , anything can happen .
all palestinians , those in the authority and those in opposition , in the occupied territories , the diaspora or the 1948 land , are passing through a dark , black , winding and long tunnel .
the suggestion that this is not the time for reform , to remove the corrupt , and trim the finger nails of those who make mischief and cause harm is nonsense .
any time , no matter how hard or cruel , is fit to put an end to internal corruption because it is the most destructive and dangerous enemy .
it is an obsolete habit to link every democratic trend , every free and liberal movement and every call for honest , straight and just administration with the american or zionist conspiracy .
it is fundamentally wrong for the call to combat corruption and political , social , economic and administrative injustice in the arab world to be a foreign demand and not a vital internal movement encompassing all classes .
in any case , arafat is currently undergoing the most difficult test in a long history of wires and mines .
his previous trials and tribulations were with israel , america , the arabs and arab interactions . now , however , he is confronting his leadership .
the issue between him and the palestinians who have been left by sharon to see arafat as a man who bargains even as he ends his 100 days of solitude , as in the garcia marquez title .
when he went to jenin he was not able to go out to it as he had dreamt , and when he went to bethlehem the town did not come out to him as he had expected .
this time the anger and oppression were much deeper than might have been supposed .
the historical leader found that two years of maltreatment , genocide and sharon had attracted the people to hamas and the notion of salvation by means of more death and more destruction .
this is a natural phenomenon .
great despair leads to absolute despair .
the suffering that the colonizer imposes as a deterrent becomes a solution and way of life for the people , especially when the difference between life and death becomes minimal to this extent .
given that arafat is the one central figure in the issue , it is natural that the movement of general palestinian feeling should be reflected in his breast .
his opponents move between professor edward said , who , initially , was one of his supporters , and now nabil amr , who was one of his confidantes .
on monday evening , abd al-bari atwan , the chief editor of al-quds al-arabi in london joined the opponents , saying on " aljazeera " that abu ammar 's popularity had fallen from 90 to 20 % .
both figures are probably inaccurate .
" hamas " and " jihad " had more than 10 % in the past and arafat retains more than 20 % now , because such a figure would mean a coup .
and that is not how the situation is .
the situation is that the greatest palestinian is now like the smallest palestinian . he senses the victory of ruins and high spirits even in the agony of death .
he feels that those who have not been broken in half a century will not be broken today .
the situation is also that no one can say the words of condolence over the rubble of jenin , even if it is the " old man " , who appeared for the first time on the tour of palestine truly to have a head of grey hair .

at the patriarchal headquarters in al-mathaf , syriac catholic patriarch agnatus butrus viii abd al-ahad met with the delegation of the " palestinian - lebanese monitoring committee " , which included : zahir al-khatib from the al-shaghilah union ; mahmud qamati and " abu hura " from hizbollah ; george shahin from the al-kataib party ; abd al-amir abbas from the arab socialist baath party ; qasim salih from the social progressive syrian party ; ali himdan from the " amal " movement ; solak totalyan from the tashnaq party ; osama himdan from the " hamas " movement ; marwan abd al-al from the popular front for the liberation of palestine ; abu hasan from " al-saiqa " ; jumaah al-abdallah from " popular front - general command " ; abu fadi hammad from the " intifada " movement ; george al-baraks from the " lebanese national front " ; and abu khalid al-mashal from the " patriotic struggle front " .
the meeting took place in the presence of the archimandrite bulus nuzhah , director general of the shuwairiyyah basilian brothers .
patriarch abd al-ahad gave a speech in which he said , " your presence here , if it is evidence of something , then it is evidence of a popular and official arab stance with the palestinian issue . the arabs have never been united and spoken with one voice as they have been united by the palestinian issue . the palestinian issue has several aspects : political , social , civilization , humanitarian and religious .
i , in my position as patriarch of the catholic antioch syriacs in the world , found the spotlight on me despite the fact that for over 36 years i have been working in a modest way and in secret to help any group of the palestinian people in its trial , which has continued for a long time .
i know well that many are working for the issue , and i wanted to work in the area of my religious and humanitarian message for this people .
from prison visits to marches , to walking alongside the martyrs ' retinues and visiting the families of martyrs to console them , to my presence at festivals and meetings held , in particular at orient house in jerusalem .
i did all of this feeling that i was fulfilling a patriotic and religious duty . "
al-khatib then spoke , saying , " we promise the patriarch that we will not betray the blood of the martyrs . the patriarch was silent , working in secret , and has come down into the arena to embody his true christianity as it was embodied in the person of the messiah on the day he confronted the blind leaders , the pharisees and the thieves , raising his voice and expelling them from the temple .
we evoke the blood of the women 's children , old men and martyrs and promise all our nobles and leaders , including the patriarch , that we will remain united to gain victory over our enemies . "
speaker of the chamber of deputies nabih birri received in his office in al-nijmah square the head of the lawyers syndicate in beirut , rimon shadid , who said the following after the meeting : " i had the honor to meet with his excellency speaker nabih birri in my capacity as head of the lawyers syndicate and tasked by the union of free professions , which includes the doctors , dentists and lawyers syndics in the north , and the engineers , pharmacists , journalists and editors .
i submitted to him a draft law concerning income tax settlement as a result of intensive meetings that we have held with the syndicates in the presence of a large number of deputies in order to amend the law issued on 24 december 2001 , which was incomplete and unjust .
we hoped that his excellency the speaker would take into consideration the recommendation of the free professions syndicates , given the interests incorporated therein for the exchequer , the state and citizens , and the commitment of all to the law .
we say that we , as free professions , are bound by the law provided that it is just and deals with all .
on this basis , we have put forward the draft , which is supported by all the free professions . "
he said , " the amendments concern those who have been silent , who have not made a statement and will do so , to settle with them for the previous years , with everyone to observe the income tax law with effect from 2002 and to submit statements annually .
the settlements law was incomplete and imposed unreasonable settlements on those who had not made a statement . it was not appropriate for the financial and economic situation in which citizens generally , and practitioners of free professions specifically , find themselves . the amendments are in the hands of speaker birri . "
birri then met with a delegation from the board of directors of the industrialists association headed by its president , fadi abbud , who said the following after the meeting : " it was a protocol visit to inform his excellency the speaker of the projects which the association conducts .
what is more important is that we have undertaken to double lebanon 's exports over four years .
we discussed with him the obstacles confronting exports , including the existence of fees and taxes . his excellency the speaker promised to draw up laws to exempt exports from all taxes and fees .
we also discussed the issue of production costs , specifically the cost of electricity in lebanon , which is the highest in industrial terms in the world . his excellency the speaker promised to tackle the matter , especially during the night period . "
the most important matter we discussed with his excellency the speaker concerned workers and unemployment . we , in the program of the industrialists association , are working to wage a war on unemployment in lebanon . we discussed with his excellency the speaker ways of making more job opportunities available to lebanese . "
the appointment of a committee to examine legal matters comprising people of knowledge and inhabitants of the house of justice , which forms the basis of government , has been announced .
we praise god that this foundation has been built , in our lebanon , on an everlasting rock , namely the sense of justice , which is firmly established in the conscience of the lebanese .
this capital they safeguard , even in these base times when money is declared bankrupt .
how many times have i given the example of the fact that a power cut for five minutes in other countries results in crimes resembling the on - going crimes of the quarter of a century in lebanon , at the hands of the people of evil in power .
i do not excuse the ignorance of the ignorant , but i stress the crime of the criminal perpetrators and instigators , who drag the people to criminality and war " who make them carry heavy loads , which they do not touch with their fingertips " .
( christ ) .
with this introduction we wanted to provide evidence that the application of law is in the nature of the lebanese , who thirst for order .
at every moment they have one stance that unites them with those who promise this to them .
the people are peaceable .
as for the government , it is supported by the people of this world and religion , and so is not peaceable .
we point out to the new committee , the knowledgeable , the understanding , that reform will take place by application of the laws governing procedure , which resemble the most important international legislation .
the disaster has happened , on account of the gross breach of the law governing the principles of civil trials , which made two judiciaries out of one and created a need for an unlimited number of judges ( like someone wanting to collect water in a container with no bottom ) , thereby allowing the cancerous tumor to spread to the judiciary , as is the case in the administration ( may god make it not so ) .
despite the explicitness of the provisions that created just one judiciary , one that does not need the present number .
everyone mistakenly agrees that it must be increased , just as they agree to violate the following explicit provisions :
1 - article 579 of the civil principles stipulates verbatim as follows :
" a single judge may , in his capacity as judge for urgent matters , examine applications to take " urgent measures " .
the expression " take measures " is explicit in meaning . it does not in any sense mean that provisions should be passed " in the name of the lebanese people " as happens today .
and so we said , write in the name of the lebanese people with the exception of matanius eid . "
2 - article 580 stipulates verbatim as follows :
" the judge competent by location for urgent matters is :
... " the judge in whose competency the basis of dispute lies . ..".
this explicit text limits the powers of urgent justice to an individual judge in whose competency the basis of the dispute lies .
it is therefore not possible for a judge in whose competency the basis does not lie , as happens today .
on this basis all the decisions of urgent justice are rendered wholly null and void , whether they be first instance , appeal or cassation , in view of their being given by a judge who has no competency in the basis of the dispute , as article 580 requires .
article 580 is explicit . it requires that an urgent measure be taken in commercial cases by an individual judge competent in commercial cases .
and that the urgent measure be taken in cases of rent by a single judge competent in cases of rent .
so too with every urgent measure : it must be taken by a judge competent in the basis .
it does not lie in the competency of anyone else at all .
article 589 confirms verbatim as follows :
" the judge in the matter of the case , as with the judge in urgent matters , may . .. take . . . all temporary measures . "
this article notes the instance of taking urgent measures whilst the case is being examined .
whilst in article 580 it notes the instance of urgent measures being taken prior to the case being brought .
both articles confirm that the competent judge in the two cases is one in whose competence the basis of the dispute lies .
may god protect these articles against being updated or revoked , as is the case with every just and fair law !
3 - they have breached these binding principles and created a judiciary for urgent matters , without having any competence in the basis .
there are thus two judiciaries in lebanon : one for the basis , and another for urgent matters .
and the urgent judiciary , which violates the principles , is absorbing a large number of judges .
in each governorate there are four individual judges , an appeals chamber , and a chamber of cassation in beirut .
the only urgency lies in the name .
4 - conforming to the deadlines specified in limited days and hours , whether in criminal , civil or administrative principles before the state consultative council and committees , secures legal justice " under penalty of the judge being deemed to have refrained from establishing the truth . . . should he delay without reason issuing a ruling " , as article 4 of the civil principles explicitly states .
5 - compliance with the text of article 580 , which establishes one judiciary , corrects the error , secures justice , and make the present number of judges excess , not a shortfall , may god lengthen your lives .
the lord will not ignore a judiciary of ours that holds the blessed yeast , and he has his innocent witnesses !
al-askua square , the ain al-hilwah camp and a number of areas witnessed a series of protests and movements in commemoration of the catastrophe .
the palestinian liberation organization called for a general strike today and for participation in a central political festival at al-rashidiyyah camp .
the democratic front for the liberation of palestine organized a protest in front of al-askua , in which deputies nasir qandil and walid eido , head of journalists syndicate muhammad baalbaki and member of the front 's political bureau ali faisal spoke .

the " popular front for the liberation of palestine " ( general command ) issued a statement saying that it was " taken aback by the statement issued by the recent tripartite sharm al-sheikh summit ( ...)".
during their regular meeting , which was held at the hizbollah offices in baalbak , the lebanese parties discussed various political developments and " contemplated the 54th anniversary of the rape of palestine " . they confirmed , " the option of resistance and intifada that many of the palestinian forces have adopted practically is the only option capable of recovering palestine and liberating the land and the people . "
the parties condemned " the suspicious international silence at what took place in jenin camp and the expulsion of the owners of the land from their land , which constitutes a precedent that cannot be accepted " .
the two leaderships of " the independent christians movement " ( al-murabitun ) and the " islamic unity movement " held a meeting .
those assembled issued a statement on the anniversary of the catastrophe .
after agreement was reached on cell phone privatization , prime minister rafiq al-hariri visited baabda palace at 8:30 am yesterday and met with president of the republic emil lahud in their first meeting at the republican palace since the recent dispute .
al-hariri explained that following the meeting , which lasted an hour , he and lahud discussed various domestic issues . " there was an agreement of opinion that it was important to make administrative work more effective and speed up the start of privatization . "
in response to a question , he said , " the meeting of the council of ministers scheduled after tomorrow , thursday , will be devoted to studying an agenda covering ordinary matters . "
in the afternoon al-hariri visited speaker nabih birri at his office in the chamber .
it was understood that the meeting dealt with the details of the agreement reached in connection with cell phone privatization and the results of the meeting held between the prime minister and the president of the republic .
al-hariri met at the saraya with deputies qablan isa al-khuri and jibran tuq in the presence of former head of the lawyers syndicate michel khattar and attorney for the bishri municipality hani rahmah , then with deputy wajih al-bairini .
tuq said that discussion dealt with developmental and service issues relating to the bishri area , including the infrastructure project for the qadisha region and violations against municipal property in al-arz . " we asked for a full - time property judge to be appointed to examine the protests in the area of bishri municipality . "
on leaving , al-bairini explained that the discussion had dealt with the demand issues of the ukkar area , including a number of roads and the importance of making the preparations for electricity network performance and commencement of work on the approved schools projects .
al-hariri met with former deputy manuel yunis , followed by a delegation from the mukhaibar family , which thanked him for his condolences to the family for the death of deputy albert mukhaibar .
he also met a delegation from the lebanon ambassadors forum headed by former ambassador fuad al-turk , who gave the following speech : " in the name of my fellow ambassadors , i thank you for welcoming us despite your many preoccupations and concerns , especially at present .
this noble gesture reflects the trust your excellency has in the role of our forum . we also view it as appreciation of the services performed by lebanon 's ambassadors over the past decades .
the forum includes 94 ambassadors , 66 of them from the foreign service corps and 28 from outside it , including former and present prime ministers , ministers and deputies , who hold in their memory , luggage and papers long years of experience and practice .
the aim of establishing this forum was to strengthen the ties of cooperation , friendship and fellowship between the members , to strive to establish a society where lebanese and foreign ambassadors could meet , to cooperate with similar forums in the arab world and abroad , and to establish a diplomatic publication , for which i have the honor to present to you the first two editions .
however , the forum 's aims in the first instance were to put the experience of its members at the disposal of lebanon 's interests , without charge , given their awareness of the necessity of mobilizing all lebanese moral , intellectual and scientific powers and capacities in the march towards renaissance , salvation and development .
the forum has taken slow and deliberate , but firm , steps . we look with optimism and confidence to greater activity and movement towards realization of the aims and goals for which we strive .
we also hope to make effective the links with the institutions of state and the relevant authorities to offer all that can be offered so that the banner of lebanon will continue to fly high , in order that lebanon will remain a nation of pride , honor and innovation , a nation of truth , good and beauty . "
in the evening in quraitim al-hariri met with a delegation from the " union of beirut families associations " headed by amin aitani .
the public works , transportation and energy committee has ratified a draft law laid down in decree number 7656 to exempt the lebanon electricity organization from charges payable on the issue of collection orders related to arrears accumulated by subscribers . it continued with discussion of the plan to rescue and develop the company by focusing on collection and violations .
chairman of the committee deputy muhammad qabbani confirmed that the optimism shown by the committee after the meeting " is not good news for the investors .
we speak facts and truths and do not play the game of investors . "
he said that in relation to production " the differences with the companies on the operation of steam complexes at the dir ammar and al-zahrani plants have been dealt with " but " there still remain some obstacles facing implementation of the works for completion of the networks . "
he added that the committee had confirmed its support for the company to deal with these obstacles , to seek the assistance of the security forces when necessary and to inform it of the results within one month .
he indicated that there was a focus on collection because the failure to collect the invoices is the fundamental cause of financial wastage in the electricity sector .
he commented that the picture in 2001 was " black in relation to invoicing and collection . however serious treatment has begun in relation to the installation of meters and resolution of the problems relating to interference with meters and connecting up to the boxes of these meters and the network . "
he said , " sealing of meters has started to prevent interference . 80 thousand meters have been sealed in beirut and the suburbs of al-shiyah and antilias , and 5000 in juniah .
sealing in sidon , jubb jenin and rayaq has begun .
facilities to pay meter charges have been provided and installation in april reached an average of 450 meters a day . "
he added , " there is a clear response by the distant regions such as ukkar for the request for meters and modernization of the collection system has begun . "
he stated that the financial prosecutor general has confirmed that immediate prosecution has begun for reports referred to him and that a representative of the internal security forces has shown the response of the security forces in following up collection work .
there is optimism for the future of the electricity sector in spite of the magnitude of the problems facing it , and there is hope that a financial balance will be attained at the beginning of the coming year if there are no adverse surprises , such as strikes , and provided that the sector can by moved from loss to profit in the near future . "
he was asked whether this optimism was good news for investors to come and invest in the electricity sector , and he replied : " we do not give good news to anyone . we speak facts and truths and do not play the game of investors or non - investors . we hope that at the end of the year and the start of the coming year it will achieve financial balance which means that the revenue from collection will balance the cost of expenditure . "
* you speak about the end of the year . what is the time set for privatization ?
- i do not know when privatization will take place .
the law has not yet been issued , and there is no connection between this information and privatization .
* why is collection incomplete in the districts where there are no security obstacles to the collection of the charge ?
- invoices are issued in places where there are meters , but they are not collected in full .
this is a technical loss that cannot be avoided .
if we took the highest proportion of invoicing , which is in beirut , the proportion of invoicing in administrative beirut is 87.6 % , which means that 12.4 % of invoices have not been issued .
most of this proportion relates to technical wastage .
there is wastage lost in the network from water that leaks from the pipes .
there is interference and some of this interference is technical .
if we attain collection of 90 per cent it will be very good .
* in a meeting of the parliamentary energy committee in the council of deputies deputy salih al-khir raised the issue of interruption of the electricity supply in the district of al-minyah and its environs and tripoli .
he referred to the severe rationing seen in the district when compared to other districts , at a time when works to repair the faults had been completed at the dir ammar station , which were carried out by the german company siemens .
the director general for lebanon electricity , kamal al-hayik , had promised during the session that rationing would end in al-minyah and its environs and in tripoli at the end of this month after completion of inspections of the main al-minyah 20 kilovolt transformer and the tripoli 66 kilovolt transformer .
president of the republic emil lahud yesterday discussed with a number of ministers the activities of their ministries and domestic conditions .
in this context he met with minister of culture ghassan salamah , who acquainted him with the results of the official visit he undertook to iran and the meetings he held with officials there , including iranian president muhammad khatimi .
he also informed him of the preparations underway to celebrate the " national heritage day " and the communications taking place with the world bank to secure a 50 million dollar loan to restore old towns in lebanon .
salamah clarified that he had also discussed with lahud the necessary preparations to be taken in preparation for holding the francophone conference next october .
the president of the republic then met minister of state pierre halu , who explained that they discussed the political and economic situation in the country and that he had informed him of his view on the matters put forward and the role of the council of ministers as an executive authority .
lahud also met with minister of state tallal arslan , and they discussed internal developments and regional conditions .
arslan believed , " the interests of the state must be the basis of any step , measure or stance taken by the government , especially in the economic sphere , which should be the subject of exceptional concern . "
lahud also informed minister of labor ali qansu of the results of the meeting of the board of directors of the arab labor organization held in cairo . lebanon , represented by minister qansu , was elected chairman of the board of directors for one year by consensus .
he also informed him of the decisions issued at the meeting , the most prominent of which was beirut being adopted as the headquarters for coordination between the arab social security organizations .
the meeting dealt with recent developments and the progress of the ministry 's work . qansu confirmed that the completion of the procedures relating to work permits for arabs and foreigners is taking place in accordance with the systems in operation . preparation is underway for a contract with liban post company to facilitate the transfer of permit transactions to realize the interests of those concerned , notably the investors among them .
the president of the republic also met maronite archbishop joseph bisharah .
according to official information , president lahud discussed with him political conditions and stances .
the discussion also concerned educational matters relating to the future of official lebanese certificates , especially the baccalaureate and the privee .
at 5 o ' clock president lahud met with director umar karami and discussed with him general conditions in light of current developments .
following the meeting , which lasted for one and a half hours director karami said , " we discussed with his excellency the president a number of domestic matters and put his excellency in the picture with the developments taking place . god willing , all will be well . "
the picture of deputy by - elections in al-matan al-shamali is not yet clear in light of the rumors about the failure to find a consensus candidate .
mrs. mirna al-murr is continuing her consultations on the possibility of putting herself forward , bearing in mind that this could be final after she submitted her resignation as head of batgrin municipality and the union of al-matan municipalities .
elsewhere , candidate ghassan mukhaibar insists on continuing with his candidacy and not accepting any other consensus candidate , stressing that he is the consensus candidate .
mukhaibar had submitted his candidacy officially to the ministry of the interior via his agent salim mukhaibar and bore candidacy application number 2 .
he visited leader of the national bloc party , carlos adah , and discussed with syndic antoine qalimos matters relating to the by - elections in al-matan .
the meeting between mukhaibar and adah took place in the context of " exchanging views and permanent coordination on all issues relating to the election dues , including consensus ideas and practical preparation for the election battle " .
mukhaibar conducted a series of other consultations with some prominent people in the area and met in the afternoon with the leader of the free patriots party , duri shimun .
at the same time the communications led by archbishop joseph basharah , who yesterday visited president of the republic emil lahud , continued .
for his part , in an interview with the " central news agency " , candidate ghubrial al-murr announced that " the efforts to reach a consensus have stumbled , blaming deputy michel al-murr for this failure " because it seems that he will enter the election battle through his daughter mrs. mirna " .
he said , " the battle is moving towards the line of the opposition , which is represented by gabriel al-murr , and the loyalist line , which is represented by mirna michel al-murr . "
he added , " despite the ministry of the interior being neutral there are some agencies in the government interfering . "
he said , " i will take a stance on this subject later , especially given that the battle is still at its early stages .
i will not accept illegitimate practices by any party . i am known for not being accustomed to accepting any pressure and no pressures have been brought to bear on me .
from the start of the battle i have shown a desire for a consensus but the efforts have collapsed and the battle still stands . "
he asked , " for whom should i withdraw ?
is there a readiness for a consensus for the national interest ?
i suggest that deputy michel al-murr resign from his position as deputy in return for me withdrawing my candidacy from the elections . if there is no response to my proposal , i think it unlikely that there will be consensus solutions and it will consequently be deputy al-murr who has obstructed the consensus in al-matan and wanted the battle . "
* dr nasib khuri said , " the position announced by brigadier michel aun of his gradually transcending the boycott , and his support for mr gabriel al-murr , demonstrates courage , experience and wisdom . it also puts president emil al-jamil and mr. nasib lahud , in addition to the other groups hesitant to support this candidacy , in an embarrassing position , one that forces them to rush to declare this support . it may be that public opinion prefers and wants unity of the opposition stance behind this candidacy in order to give it greater meaning and an important chance of success . only brigadier aun has done this so far . he has tried to bring the subject out of the maze of hesitancy and the usual maneuvers . "
" the federation of lebanese christian unions " condemned the explosion that took place in tripoli and targeted a kentucky fried chicken restaurant . they demanded that the perpetrators be pursued and brought to justice .
they also condemned the disappearance of engineer ramzi airani , considering it " a serious setback for the security credibility of the state " .
the federation held its weekly meeting , which was chaired by the head of the maronite union haris shihab , and issued a statement read by the secretary - general of the federation habib afram . it said :
1 - " the federation dealt with the dispute that broke out among those in power against the background of the privatization issue starting with the matter of the cell phone . despite the way out that was found , it believes that it is a dangerous indicator , one that does not give much cause for optimism , if the institutional rules on which the state should be based are not respected .
if the constitution does not hold sway , its text is not binding and the mechanisms for which it provides are not implemented when there is a difference of views on public matters affecting the interests of citizens and the state at the same time .
2 - the manner in which the situations are dealt with cannot lead to the desired results unless those in power work as one team in bringing about a rapprochement in respect of the accumulated problems and the present challenges , which increase day - by - day , and choke the nation and the citizens .
the lebanese fear that any solution reached on any matter that does not rely on a firm institutional basis is no more than a truce that will quickly be revoked by differences over other matters of dispute , of which there are many .
3 - recently , there have been worrying developments on the security front , which have attracted the attention of the lebanese . they include the issue of the disappearance of engineer ramzi airani , which recalls the kidnappings that dominated a black stage in the history of their country and one that cost them much .
the federation strongly condemns such an approach and believes that it represents a serious setback for the security credibility of the state at a time when the twin factors of security and stability are being exploited to attract tourists and investments .
it rejects the notion that political affiliation and party activity should constitute a cause for such action , which contravenes the constitution , norms and laws .
it demands that the state reveal the circumstances of this incident with maximum urgency and strive to uncover airani 's location , to free him and arrest the perpetrators and instigators , in order to bring into action its authority and to reassure citizens .
kidnapping is prohibited , as are unjustified detentions and arrests , the opening of cases such as that of kafr ubaida gives the impression that the war file is still with us , at least for some lebanese , and this we forcefully reject .
the federation also condemns the explosion that took place in tripoli , the capital of the north , which strikes at the heart of the lebanese economy , affects the interests of the people , harms individual initiative and helps " export " capital abroad at a time when the state is working and offering facilities , at times tempting , to attract it . it also demands that the state pursue the perpetrators and those who pushed them to this act and bring them to justice . "
the fact that yasir arafat was unable to visit jenin camp after everything that happened to it and in it after he came out from under the siege can perhaps be understood from the " security perspective " as was announced , but you cannot help but understand the disappointment of the inhabitants of the camp at the cancellation of the visit and the inspection of those of its people and descendants who were victims .
this is one circumstance of the stage following arafat 's liberation from his siege , which leaves him facing two dangers : the permanent israeli danger and the immediate " palestinian danger " arising from the complications of the past cruel weeks .
when arafat is no longer able to meet the palestinian people at the sites of their misfortune when he wishes and for whatever reason , this constitutes a major source of imbalance in the relationship between the head of the authority and the people .
what is more important than everything taking place these days , however , is the complete collapse of the peace process or what remained of it . all ideas of peace are hostage to two election battles , one american and one israeli .
the first bazaar can be clearly indicated , namely that president george bush undoubtedly aspires to bring about the victory of his republican party in the new congress during the elections that will take place next november .
through his excessive flirtation with the jewish election balance , bush hopes to gain control with a clear majority over the councils of deputies and senators , thereby completing the mission of his victory of the executive ( the white house ) and the legislative ( the congress ) .
from this perspective , one must examine the fact that the american president has reached the maximum in his stances in support of israel , whilst having dropped to the bare minimum in preserving the nominal and symbolic support for president arafat , after some arab friends warned him of the consequence of getting rid of arafat and creating an alternative authority , one that would implement israeli orders , because that would be tantamount to treating the error from which israel and america complain with a greater error .
this is the first bazaar , which will continue and carry on until november , the date for legislative elections in the united states .
the second bazaar is an israeli one , where a storm of sharp differences between members of the likud party blows and the conflict grows more intense between sharon and netanyahu , who is the only one to rival his colleague , the prime minister , as a demagogue and chatterbox , which unfortunately affects public opinion and led to his humiliating fall in previous elections .
but " israeli - style democracy " puts the fate of the establishment of the palestinian state in the electoral auction , and would refuse to do otherwise . sharon and netanyahu compete in terms of who holds the greatest contempt for the palestinians and the arabs . it is not a competition for equality or how to achieve it - it is an escalation that is pivotal and provides the criteria .
however , the vote of the likud party against the establishment of the palestinian state does not address the palestinians as much as it addresses the israeli people , who wander about and become embroiled with themselves over this and other issues , with many supporting the idea of establishing a state in return for a secure life .
the recent likud vote is a slap in the face for the greater ally , the united states , which has worked through more than one international security council resolution to persuade all the major states with the power of veto to agree to the idea of establishing a ( sustainable ) palestinian state , along side the state of israel .
this applies to more than one resolution issued , to some extent , in a haphazard way , from resolution 1397 , to 1402 and 1403 .
perhaps there may be more resolutions in the future .
but the state of palestine is still on paper in the delusions of some and a reality in the dreams of others .
those who resist know that independence is taken not given , and so they do not rely on israeli decision of yes or no , or on any other decision , but act out the saying : " noble honor is not safe from harm . "
amidst these sharp interactions in likud party circles , and amidst this auction between sharon and netanyahu , things are going in the opposite direction for the national authority and its people . thus whilst entering into the battle of the right of return for the palestinians of the diaspora to their state sooner or later , the national authority is forced once more to submit to the pressures and accept the principle of " the right to exile " instead of " the right to return " , when thirteen palestinians were transported to cyprus , where they await the decision of the european union to distribute them among the states of the union .
it is not sufficient for israel to say that it will not seek to try them . there is something more dangerous than that , namely to leave them as prey to israeli eyes spread throughout the world .
all the evidence shows that the dual american - israeli election auctions , which are automatically inter - related , will see further escalation in the field .
awaiting the battle , there is the worst result , a worse result or one that is less so , but there is no ideal solution : if george w . bush succeeds in his plan and improves his electoral standing , he will thereby increase his customary arrogance . in addition , there is the possibility of sharon falling or being brought down and netanyahu 's arrival . in neither case is there any good for the palestinians or the arabs generally .
from now until the results of the israeli - american election bazaars become clear there will be a thousand and one developments awaiting the region , whether they be included under the tactical heading or under the other . . . strategic heading .
no matter how the two slogans differ in terms of technique and policy , the aim is one .
the hope remains that bush will recall that it was he who committed himself to establish the palestinian state some months earlier , whether by conviction or by compulsion .
for likud are an israeli party that will retreat from its policies and slogans in return for any electoral gain .
but washington must remain washington .
maronite patriarch cardinal mar nasrallah butrus safir observed , " there are many interactions , which we hope will be stopped so that the officials will resume their path in re - establishing the situation after its collapse . " he believed , " the economic situation is contemptible - this is no secret . but we most not lose hope and give in to despair . the future belongs to god , the present to us . "
yesterday afternoon in bikirki safir received a delegation from the " independent students " at a number of universities . student ramiz barhush gave a speech on their behalf , saying , " this great national edifice is a refuge for the wronged and those whose rights have been plundered . it is the principal support for just and righteous causes for our people and our nation .
we are honored to visit you as independent students to declare to you our support for your patriotic stances , which have become firm bases , and to communicate to you our fear for our economic and security destiny in this nation .
the economic situation is continually deteriorating and we no longer see a future in this country . the horizons are blocked and the living conditions are very difficult , to the extent that our hope in the nation 's resurrection is almost lost , especially when the continuous disputes among the pillars of the government cause institutional paralysis and loss of confidence in the country .
the security situation threatens to collapse , especially given the increasing number of explosions recently , the perpetrators of which are unknown , in addition to the disappearance of our friend ramzi airani in broad daylight in the center of the capital , without any trace of him being found . it is as if we are living on a farm ruled by gang law , although it sometimes assumes the guise of democracy .
we ask the state to reveal immediately the circumstances of this crime and to punish those responsible because it is not just a security issue , but a national , humanitarian one that may affect us all in the absence of law and security .
we thank you for meeting with us . we are all confident that the issues will be the subject of your concern because you do not adopt silence in the face of injustice and your mind will not rest until ramzi airani returns to his family and true lebanon restores itself . "
the patriarch responded , " we share with you your concerns , and you referred to the political and economic situation and to the situation of engineer airani .
these are all matters of worry and concern . but we must not see life as black . there must be hope . anyone losing hope falls into despair .
despair is unjust advice and should not be followed .
in any case , the past has gone , the future belongs to god and the present , the minute that we live , to us . we must use it for good and must also hope for good .
the economic situation is contemptible . this is no secret . all the people complain .
the same applies to the political situation . there are many interactions , which we hope will be stopped so that the officials will resume their path in re - establishing the situation after its collapse .
there are explosions some times . the disappearance of engineer airani , who must come to light , one week ago is a security setback as we said at the beginning . this must stop , so that people can be reassured in their lives and livelihood .
in this matter , having no other means , we seek recourse in and ask god to guide everyone to goodness . "
the patriarch had met with professor dominic chauvilet from the sorbonne university , followed by sheikh wadi al-khazin , the director general of the maronite brothers of mary , abbot francois aid , who sought permission to travel to rome and paris , and attorney bahiyyah abu hamad .
today safir will chair the monthly meeting of the maronite archbishops council . the agenda includes church and national issues .
rita safir wrote :
will the smog of appointments be dispersed with the " smog " of cell phones , including the civil service council , to complete the authority 's quorum ?
it has become known that there has been an administrative paralysis in the state for some time , and the stagnation arising from delay in filling vacancies will be translated into paralysis in the departments and hindrance of people 's affairs . its fallout affects the council of ministers , especially in relation to the civil service and the central audit authority .
this point was a matter of discussion in the last session of the council of ministers derived from known facts raised and they were followed by a detailed reply from the president of the republic emil lahud .
these known facts intersect with " the actual fact " which continues to prevail in the ministry of information for the same reason .
in this atmosphere , ministry circles anticipate that the " cell phone stir " will lead to administrative appointments , especially in the civil service , with the names nominated to work in the vacant maronite center in the civil service being put forward , such as the administrative inspector general , asad dumat , or the director general , head of the technical affairs branch in the government headquarters , claude saad .
it is known that the council of ministers relies in its decisions in cases and files referred to it on opinions expressed by the civil service council and the audit authority and currently partially paralyzed bodies .
in the civil service council there is a vacant maronite position and a proxy member ( orthodox ) to the president naturally .
in the central audit authority , a member has been appointed as a proxy member ( atif al-muqallid ) . he is a member of the supreme disciplinary authority , and this has aroused comments on the duality of tasks assigned to him and the need to separate the members of the authority , those which accuse the employee and those that try him .
the vacancies in the civil service council are reflected in the position of employees and their families , in particular in relation to those placed in retirement .
the decisions are suspended until further notice and with them pensions .
sources in the civil service speak of thousands of transactions held up as a result of the current situation .
the issue of vacancies is also casting its shadow on the ministry of information amidst a state of confusion .
while the ministry has rearranged its internal affairs , and following transfer of some of these contractors to the surplus list and entrusting the tasks in accordance with contracts distributed among the contractors , pursuant to the proposed structure , the ministry found itself today in a blind alley : the break up of the civil service council contract prevents ratification of the contracts .
more than that , it places the credibility of the ministry in question and threatens to destroy the whole operation .
ministry circles speak about " a blow " sustained because of this situation ; however , they point on the contrary side to the fact that a search is underway for administrative - financial solutions to legitimize the position in the event that the anticipated appointments to the civil service are delayed .
according to the same sources , a temporary solution to the current problem may be adopted , which will lead to entrusting the tasks laid down in the contracts to those concerned , with compensation for the difference in salary stated in the contracts with allowances for production given to the contractors by a decision of the minister .
this is the first time that the minister of information , ghazi al-uraidi , has had recourse to this arrangement , according to circles in the ministry which have criticized the distribution of these allowances to friends and favorites previously , to the degree that some of them have exceeded the basic salary .
under the new contracts , the increases affect the salaries of about 35 per cent of contractors , and against this , the salaries of others are reduced .
based on prepared tables , it is clear that a hundred of those who have so far been transferred to the surplus list have not been distributed among the ministries .
the ministry has received visits from contractors , who have complained that departments have refused to receive them , even though they have obtained the required certificates and qualifications .
this has led the civil service council to send letters to these departments asking them to explain the refusal .
elsewhere ministerial sources deny that the civil service council has previously refused to approve some measures taken in the ministry , indicating that there has been a debate on so - called " filling the gap " between those with certificates who cannot be appointed in the third class and those of them appointed in the said class , noting that the salary difference between the two classes is 300 thousand lira .
it is reported that the civil service council has expressed no negativity towards the move .
at the same time as the ministerial sources hope that the atmosphere of quiet prevailing currently will be reflected positively on appointments to the civil service , they do not deny that the recovery of confidence and respect for the project proposed by the minister , ghazi al-uraidi , might require some time , especially after absenteeism has returned to the departments in the ministry .
circles in the ministry will renew a series of steps which it had announced it would apply in the event that affairs become normalized , such as a tightening up control of attendance , before concluding , " the project is continuing , and in the event that the appointments are delayed the form of implementation will change ; otherwise the content will remain as it is . "

the ministry of finance has finally released 500 million lira for rashia government hospital . the hospital administration will receive 200 million with the remainder to be handed over next week .
this step took place following the visit undertaken by deputy faisal al-dawid and the chairman of the hospital board of directors , riyadh al-qaraawi , to the minister of finance fuad al-sinyurah .
al-dawid quoted his " concern that the hospital continue its work like the other government hospitals in spite of the difficult circumstances experienced by the country " .
he confirmed that all bills due for the year 2001 would be paid within ten days of receiving them from the ministry of health . this will be followed by payment of the bills for this year , which will lighten the severity of the financial crisis experienced by the hospital over about 8 months .
al-dawid and al-qaraawi also met officials at the ministry of health , who confirmed their support for the hospital 's administration and those in charge of it .
the pair were informed by them that the ministry had decided to establish a card center for patients being treated at the expense of the ministry within the hospital in order to ensure that treatment opportunities were available for all .
al-qaraawi confirmed , " this integrated step to secure the money and pay the accumulated bills due represents a qualitative step forward , one that will strengthen the hospital 's fund and activate the workings of its departments . "
baalbak - " al-nahar " :
the final number of candidates for the municipal by - elections in the town of shaat ( baalbak ) has settled at 27 for the 15 - member municipal council . the deadline for withdrawing candidacy is at midnight monday evening / tuesday .
the following five candidates have withdrawn : muin harb harb ; ahmad ali zuatir ; ali muhammad al-attar , naif abdallah al-attar and subhi ali asi . the latter was on the " shaat families ' decision " list , which means that the two rival lists are incomplete , which strengthens the possibility of a breach .
in the town of shalifa ( baalbak ) , where elections will take place on sunday to chose five members of the municipal council ( 12 seats ) , candidate robert saba ruadi has withdrawn leaving six candidates , whose names follow : rashid wadi maaluf , shaaya khalil al-khuri , saad yusif saqlawi , said salim maaluf , hulu yusif barrak and nafidh jibran al-hadshiti .
at the height of the cell phone battle , citizens ask : where has the matter of violations against maritime public property gone , or the violations against the mountains of lebanon , which the machines are tearing to pieces , in order to sell their sand and stones for dollars , whilst the state does not benefit from these two items with one white piastre in these dark and gloomy times ?
the wasting of hundreds of millions of dollars that is taking place as a result of ignoring the violations against maritime properties , whilst those infringing are benefiting from the coasts , air and waters of the state , hoping that its coma continues indefinitely , so that the dollars continue to pour into their pockets from the swimming pools , cafes and tourist resorts they built decades ago , and by which they continue to invade the lebanese coast from the far north to the south , on the way past beirut beach .
even talking about the machines , diggers and sand stores is forbidden . we cannot hear one word speaking about those who pulverize the mountains of lebanon , turning them into desolate ground , whilst their pockets and bank accounts overflow with dollars .
today , we bring to the attention of beirut 's excellent municipal council that a large hole has appeared on the pavement parallel to the ministries of tourism and media , to hold a parasol for the traffic police . the parasol was put up more than 25 days ago but the debris from the hole still covers the pavement parallel to the glass structure where exhibitions and celebrations are held .
has someone seen this mound of sand and rocks and decided to ignore it or not ?
the spring weather that has lasted for more than a month yesterday turned into rainy and stormy weather in some northeastern and northwestern areas .
this situation is repeated as the years pass .
an area of low pressure dominated the area . it was accompanied by cold air blocs that changed into storms and rain in the different areas surrounding the mediterranean .
the change in winds led to heavy rainfall on monday evening and yesterday morning in the beqaa and al-harmal , continuing into syrian territory .
in the afternoon it shifted into the mountains and the north with intermittent lightning storms and cold spells for short periods , causing damage to some fruit - bearing trees .
according to the international weather forecast , this change has reached its peak and the weather will return to its spring condition quickly .
the speed of surface winds in lebanon will today reach 50km . the expected temperature on the coast is 16 - 22 degrees and in the mountains from 9 - 14 degrees , as in the beqaa .
the al-nahar correspondent in marjayun reports that the rains falling in the area have revitalized olive farmers and will give a prosperous season .
al-daniyyah - " al-nahar " :
the works on the tripoli - al-daniyyah road by more than one contractor have not led to the desired results . in fact , according to the testimony of owners of commercial premises and drivers , they have caused " massive damage that began to accumulate five years ago , especially in the tourist season , in 54 villages " .
as a result of the works to prepare the road , which is 35 km long , to the sir - al-safirah road , which extends for tens of kilometers .
in a tour by al-nahar in the area , the comments of citizens were as follows :
sidon - " al-nahar " :
following completion of the sea boulevard extending from the alaman - al-ramilah crossroads to the first bridge at the northern entry to the city of sidon , those concerned have been busy over the last days in landscaping this section with palm trees , mullein and pine .
the lady supervising the landscaping and planting , eng . ghanwah al-aris zantut , representative from the " jinico " company , noted that about 100 palm trees were being planted along the two pavements of the boulevard , in addition to 55 mullein , cypress and pine trees in al-wastiyyah .
it should be mentioned that the landscaping of the boulevard is part of a project for which a study was prepared by " dar al-handasah " and which is implemented by " jinico " company with funding from the development and construction council .
a delegation representing the heads of the sidon - al-zahrani municipalities ( al-nahar ) visited the head of the deputies finance and budget committee samir azar at his home in jazin . they asked the chamber of deputies to move towards the ministry of finance in order to free the municipalities funds , which " are considered to be held in trust and for which it has no right of disposal " .
members of the delegation noted that " the municipalities are unable to meet their commitments " . they urged the state to incorporate the heads and employees of the municipalities in the social fund to reduce the financial burden on the municipalities .
azar was quoted as being prepared to follow up the matter with those concerned in the government , calling on the heads of municipalities to move towards the executive authority , which will take the decision to dispense the municipality dues .
* the deputies of baabda and the heads of the southern al-matan plain - baabda municipalities are called to an emergency meeting at 5pm tomorrow at the headquarters of al-shiyah municipality to study matters relating to value - added tax and municipal revenues , especially in the lebanon electricity company , in order to adopt a unified position in respect thereof .
al-damur municipality has adopted the proposal submitted by colleague kamal asbar al-gharib , member of the press syndicate council , to erect a commemorative monument bearing the name of al-damur journalists who have died . they held and published concessions for regular , daily political publications and number 18 . some published them in their hometown . another group of journalists are still alive and working .

syndicate head baalbaki thanked the al-damur municipal council in the persons of mr. ghafri and mr. aql for this initiative , hoping that the project would be completed at the earliest opportunity .
al-daniyyah - " al-nahar " :
the works on the tripoli - al-daniyyah road by more than one contractor have not led to the desired results . in fact , according to the testimony of owners of commercial premises and drivers , they have caused " massive damage that began to accumulate five years ago , especially in the tourist season , in 54 villages " .
as a result of the works to prepare the road , which is 35 km long , to the sir - al-safirah road , which extends for tens of kilometers .
in a tour by al-nahar in the area , the comments of citizens were as follows : " there is a project to prepare the tripoli - sir road .
but there is no work or movement on the part of the contractor .
we were surprised yesterday by machines that it brought , which began to work on the kafrhabbu - ashshash crossroads .
if the work continues like this .
this recalls the image of the frog that intends to leave lebanon for hong kong . "
for his part , deputy ahmad fitfit said in a press conference held at the kafrhabbu - al-daniyyah crossroads , " one can no longer remain silent at what is taking place on the main al-daniyyah road . for the third successive year , the summer tourist season in al-daniyyah has been ended by the tripoli - sir - hawarah road .
what is happening constitutes a criminal act against the rights of the impoverished inhabitants of the area who , in practical terms , have no other source of income , following the collapse of agriculture ( one of the causes for which was also the road ) .
instead of preparations , a large part of the road , and at various points , have been turned into some sort of planted fields on which citizens break their cars every day . "
he believed , " what is taking place represents recklessness with the rights of the people and the organized delay of work constitutes a form of embezzlement , which takes hostage the interests of the people in return for imposing financial and technical conditions for the interest of the contractor with the approval of the supervision , of which the minister of works najib miqati said was the cause of the problem and was as bad as it could possibly be . "
miqati demanded , " an emergency declaration should be made for the al-daniyyah road and the financial , technical and human capacities of the ministry be made available to save what can be saved and the following steps taken :
supervision should be replaced immediately after it has been proven a failure , whether for reasons of incompetence or personal benefit .
- the contractor should be forced to abide by the schedule signed on 30 / 03 / 2002 , which requires that the works of the first section ( up to irdah ) be completed on 30 / 04 / 2002 , up to kafrhabbu by 30 / 05 / 2002 and up to bakhuan by 30 / 06 / 20002 . of course this is unlikely for one reason , namely that the contractor has not made available the equipment and machinery necessary to carry out his commitments .
- work begins immediately to repair the damage arising from the cessation of the preparation workshop between sir and al-qatin , in particular to repair the irrigational canals given that the irrigation season will start in a few days .
- give immediate instruction for proper maintenance of the turn - off points on the road , especially at miryatah , rashain , wadi izqi and tahwirah bakhaun - bait jayyidah ( agricultural road ) .
- intensify monitoring to prevent the contractor reusing materials ( hardcore or asphalt ) that do not comply with the specifications , as previously occurred , leading to significant losses for the project budget and , unfortunately , covered up directly by the supervision .
- remove the direct and indirect corrupt controllers and their political cover over the project , because the company , when faced with every crisis , fears resorting to the security forces and prefers material approaches , which imposes on the project major additional burdens that affect the quality and period of implementation .
- serious examination of compensation for the people of the area because the losses and damages that have accumulated over three years have exceeded the cost and benefit of the project . "
on the 14th of may this year the iranians celebrated the 110th anniversary of al-mirza al-shirazi , the strongest religious authority in iran at that time , issuing his famous fatwa prohibiting the use of tobacco . the people obeyed and threw the water pipes off the roofs of their buildings into the streets , in what was known as the " tobacco uprising " , thereby causing the british authorities to submit to the volition of the iranians .
this was the first public confrontation between the iranian clerics and the government and was followed by numerous others at different stages , in which the iranians mostly submitted to what the religious authorities , who had left the narrow domain of personal jurisprudence for the public arena and major interests , said .
this does not mean that the men of religion , prior to this , had been far removed from politics and the affairs of government , but their interaction with the political arena had not been united . some of them had supported some of the kings whilst others kept themselves well away from the government .
but what al-mirza al-shirazi did was the first public clash .
there are many studies and views in the history of contemporary iran that analyze the phenomenon of the men of religion and their place in iranian society , and whether they constitute a social class or not .
studies that adopt the marxist methodology of analysis agree that they , namely the men of religion , form a class alongside the other classes of society in iran . . . without this meaning that this description applies to clerics in other societies , in particular outside the domain of the shiite sect .
since the safavid period religious scholars have come to hold great influence in iran . this class has come to have social status , rights and immunity in comparison with the other classes .
in fact the legitimacy of the political authority was , to a great extent , linked to the support of men of religion and their backing of it .
in the safavid period their political strength grew after they grew closer to the safavid " shahs " , who relied on the scholars as one of the pillars of their rule . but many of them removed themselves from government and turned to the teaching of the religious sciences alone .
iranian religious scholars then split into more than one group . some believed in the possibility of the establishment of a government representing god 's shadow on earth , thereby allowing support for the monarchy embodying that rule . others adopted the view that it could only be established by jurists . still others opposed the intervention of men of religion in politics .
during the qajarite and pahlavi periods the first group were active . they represented a minority , one that was opposed by another minority , namely those who wanted government to be established by the scholars . most continued to exercise the doctrine of dissimulation and did not believe it permissible to intervene in political matters .
however the revolution in february 1979 embodied the rise of those calling for the establishment of islamic government . a republican regime was established based on the clerics and supervised by a religious authority known as the al-wali al-faqih , which increased radiance of this group and thereby raised their social standing and the respect offered them by the majority .
the clerics would walk in the streets and the people would bow before them putting their right hand on their chest in respect , as is the social custom in iran .
the electorate looked at the pictures of candidates and preferred the turbaned candidate to the effendi .
but the presence of a cleric in the position of an advisor , guide and demagogue changed him in positions of government and executive positions .
for he could not remain as he was and nor were the people prepared to forgive him when he slipped up .
and many iranian clerics have confessed to making mistakes when they came to official positions .
do you think that if al-mirza al-shirazi returned today and issued a fatwa calling for a boycott of american goods , for example . . . how many iranians would throw them in the streets as they threw the water pipes more than a century ago ?
the demand for the us dollar decreased yesterday in comparison with previous days in the beirut discount market following a report that the privatization of cell phones is on the way to a solution .
however , what was on offer was tiny outside the framework of the bank of lebanon , which by retaining its margin of intervention as it was , between 1501.00 lira ( buy ) and 1514.00 lira ( sell ) , caused it to close nominally as normal since 9 september 1999 at a declared average price of 1507.50 lira .
at the same time , banks continued dealings in it , at times with the central bank and at other times among themselves , at the upper limit of this margin . this was in a relatively calm market in which the volume of transactions did not exceed ten million dollars , most of them from its share of sales at 1514.00 lira .
abroad , the dollar continued to strengthen its positions against the other major currencies , and especially after the publication of the retail sales index in the united states , which recorded a rise above expectations at 1.2 per cent last month , instead of 0.6 per cent as had been expected . this is the highest since last october , against 0.1 per cent in march , in a development that reflected the level of increase in consumer spending by americans , which generally forms two thirds of the volume of the economy . this stimulated the demand for shares in the wall street and nasdaq stock exchanges , which was paralleled with the dollar .
this was preceded by the publication of the zew institute index in germany , which measures the opinions of a select group of investors and financial analysts and their predictions on the direction the largest european economy will take during the coming six months . it recorded a new decline during this may of 4.30 points to 66.30 points in the preceding april , causing disappointment to traders and leading them to abandon the euro in favor of the dollar , especially in the light of the continuation of the wave of strikes in germany that have spread from one province to another in spite of the resumption of negotiations between the mining trade unions federation and employers in this sector , but so far without significant result .
all these facts have worked together on both sides of the atlantic to give the dollar a new impetus , such that it closed in london with a further increase against the other principal currencies as follows :
0.9025 euro against 0.9115 the day before yesterday in new york .
1.4490 pound sterling against 1.4565 .
1.6155 swiss franc against 1.5960 .
128.65 japanese yen against 127.85 .
1.5580 canadian dollar against 1.5555 .
the rise of the dollar had a negative impact on precious metals , especially on gold , which suffered profit - taking activity in spite of the improvement in the prices of oil . an ounce of gold closed in london at 307.60 dollars against 310.60 dollars the day before yesterday in new york , after it had stabilized at 309.95 dollars in the morning and 308.40 dollars in the afternoon .
silver was unaffected by the weakness that affected gold , and an ounce of silver closed in london at 4.60 dollars against 4.5960 dollars the day before yesterday in new york , after it had stabilized at noon at 4.61 dollars .
european stock markets have continued their upward progress following the example of wall street and nasdaq after the publication of retail sales figures in the united states which stimulated hopes once more of a continuation of growth in the american economy at a good level , reflecting positively on the economies of its european partners .
there was a great demand for american technology and communications companies to support the demand for like european companies at a time of an announcement by the swiss bank on profits that exceeded expectations during the first part of the year , launching a wave of share buying in the banking sector in europe .
the extra dax index in the frankfurt stock exchange closed with a rise of 73.60 points to 5049.08 points , the cac 40 index on the paris stock exchange rose 71.73 points to 4447.12 points , and the financial times index on the london stock exchange rose 34.70 points to 5239.50 points .
the wall street and nasdaq stock exchanges received strong support from the unexpected rise in retail sails in the united states last month on the one hand and the encouraging results announced by the two largest american distribution companies , walmart and j . c .
penney during the first part of the year on the other hand .
furthermore the positive position published by the robertson stevens broking institute on the future of the intel corporation , which benefits greatly from the demand for personal computers , during the second part of the year also had a positive effect on the other companies in this sector , so that texas instruments corporation confirmed expectations of profits during the second part of the year .
all these facts joined together to push the nasdaq index upwards above the threshold of 1,715.00 points while the dow jones industrial index on wall street fluctuated between a low of 10119.34 points and a high of 10297.42 points before it recorded at the middle of trading in the evening session 10282.55 points , an increase of 172.89 points above its value the day before yesterday .
prior to this , in the morning , the principal japanese share indexes on the tokyo stock exchange varied . caution prevailed in the exchange before the retail sales figures in the united states for april were published , at a time when confirmation was received from the modez institute that it would conclude its review of the classification of japan 's sovereign debts downwards before the end of may , which spread something resembling caution in japanese markets .
the nikkei index closed with a rise of only 19.24 points to 11356.19 points .
it is expected that the council of deputies in the lebanon electricity workers syndicate will today adopt the recommendation to lift the open strike in which the employees of the al-laitani and qadisha utilities and beirut water have participated for a full week . this took place in light of the government 's response to the syndicate 's demands .
it was learnt that the statement to be issued today by the syndicates will praise the direct concern of the prime minister with the file of demands and will confirm that the lebanon electricity department has distanced itself from the legal steps of the workers in the event of there being demands .
it announced that the workers and employees are standing beside the new management , in order to make the rescue and development plan a success , which will have a positive effect on the continuation of the organization and will guarantee work for those employed in it .
the minister of finance submitted to the syndicate yesterday a copy of the decision to open a credit of one billion 22 million lira , allocated to cover the expense of extending the existing treatment insurance contract for current and former employees .
there follows the most important parts of the decision signed by minister of finance fuad al-sinyurah on 13 / 05 / 2002 .
" with reference to the two decisions of the board of directors set out in the references , which require approval for the opening of a credit in the utility 's account for 2002 before approval , provided that the sum of 1022 million lebanese lira be recorded therein , in accordance with the following reasons :
having examined the reasons for the two aforementioned decisions .
whereas the aim thereof is to secure the credit necessary to cover the cost of extending the existing treatment insurance contract for present and former employees at the same terms and conditions with company , with effect from 01 / 04 / 2002 to 30 / 06 / 2002 , and approval of the new treatment contract .
whereas this credit is allocated to cover the costs arising from the provision of medical care and treatment to employees and workers currently in service , in addition to those no longer in service on account of their having reached the legal age , as well as members of their families and dependents , on the basis of council of ministers ' decision number 4 , dated 10 / 11 / 1999 .
whereas the said decision of the council of ministers number 4 introduces duties to the utility that did not originally exist because the relationship that links the utility , in its capacity as employer , with those employees , workers and other working for it , is a contractual relationship on the basis of an employment contract or work contract , all the effects of which cease on termination of the employee 's service , including the duties of the employer to provide medical care and treatment to its workers , either directly or by means of medical care and treatment companies , or by means of the national social security fund .
whereas the specified decision of the council of ministers number 4 introduces a burden on the utility that was not originally present in return for very small contributions from those no longer in service .
whereas the ministry of finance , in its letter number 1421 on page 1 , dated 11 / 09 / 2001 , submitted the matter to the council of ministers and proposed the revocation of the relevant section of council of ministers decision number 4 , dated 10 / 11 / 1999 , thereby revoking all the amendments made to the employee regulations in the water utilities and other public organization , on the basis thereof , in addition to the revocation of every similar measure that may have been adopted by public organizations .
whereas the council of ministers with its decision number 25 , dated 27 / 09 / 2001 , decided to postpone examining the matter and seek the opinion of the minister of energy and water in preparation for it being resubmitted to the council of ministers under the provisions of the general law for public organizations .
whereas the ministry of finance believes that it is possible for those no longer in service on account of their having reached the legal age to benefit from the services of the ministry of public health , which provides the care and medical treatment for all lebanese not covered by a protection system providing such services .
whereas the result of the meeting of his excellency the prime minister and his excellency the minister of energy and water dated 12 / 05 / 2002 has led to approval for the opening of the required credit in full and the provision of medical care and treatment to the employees of the utility in service and those no longer in service , until such time as the subject is reviewed by the council of ministers , on the basis of its decision number 25 , dated 27 / 09 / 2001 , and the voluntary social security law for elderly lebanese in the national social security fund shall enter into effect .
therefore , in pursuit of the provisions of the public organizations general law .
approval has been given to the decision to open the credit the subject of discussion .
minister of public works and transport najib miqati and his syrian counterpart makram ubaid signed two agreements for cooperation between the ports of beirut and al-ladhiqiyyah and the ports of tripoli and tartus . they discussed technical , economic and commercial cooperation and coordination in the exchange of information , studying ways to make these ports capable of competing with those of neighboring countries .
miqati undertook the official visit to syria in response to an invitation from his syrian counterpart , during which the two agreements were signed .
the first stop was the port of tartus where the lebanese delegation toured the port before signing a cooperation agreement between the ports of tartus and tripoli .
the syrian minister said , "(...) we have visited tripoli port in the past weeks and we are proud of the expansion projects being undertaken in it and the development works , which will lead to great facilities for those operating in this sector . "
miqati said , " our visit to tartus and al-ladhiqiyyah is part of a series of meetings to develop transport arteries .
we have come a long way in this context towards the exemptions obtained by lebanese transporters in syria , in addition to reduced fees .
in terms of air transport , we have come a long way as can be seen by syrian airlines commencing operation at beirut airport . "
miqati and the delegation then visited al-ladhiqiyyah where they signed an agreement between it and between beirut port .
jordanian minister of transport nadir al-dhahabi attended part of the signing .
ubaid later stated , " we hope that the cooperation between our three countries will lead to integration in the maritime transport field .
the discussion dealt with matters concerning the jordanian syrian overland transport company and the lebanese syrian jordanian maritime transport company .
we reached decisions that will lead to the development of these two companies , in the service of transport between the two countries . "
the jordanian minister said , " our permanent aim is to achieve integration between our countries and not competition . "
miqati pointed out that cooperation had made advanced progress . we have begun to implement the unified passage logbook between lebanon , syria and jordan , which is a major achievement . we have discussed shortening air routes between our three countries to cover the arab gulf and the far east , in order to make our airspace attractive for different airlines . "
ministers miqati , ubaid , al-dhahabi and the secretary - general of the supreme lebanese - syrian council nasri khuri and the accompanying delegations visited the al-ladhiqiyyah branch of the arab academy for science , technology and maritime transport and examined the activities conducted by the academy to prepare sea cadres to international standards .
the three ministers received commemorative plates from the chancellor of the academy , muhammad ismail abd al-latif .
at the end of the visit , miqati , ubaid , al-dhahabi and khuri visited al-qardahah where they laid wreathes of flowers on the tomb of late president hafiz al-asad . they read the fatihah over his tomb and that of maj. basil al-asad .
" because we expect spending by visa card - carrying visitors to lebanon to increase by 25 % this year , and because 23 banks deal with visa card with 200,000 cards , we have chosen lebanon to launch our annual campaign based on persuading for better use of the investments by the banks involved . "
with these words , the director general of " visa " international in the countries of the east of the arab world , central and eastern europe region , the middle east and africa , said shaqam , told " al-nahar " about lebanon 's importance as a tourist destination in the region during this year . this has led visa international to choose it as a target to assist member banks in making better use of their investments , by preparing to encourage tourists and summer visitors to increase their spending in lebanon by using visa cards .
he explained that the campaign , which began yesterday , would continue until the end of next september and includes the distribution of about 290 thousand visa cards through the banks , 50 thousand of them to be distributed in lebanon with the remainder to be distributed elsewhere in the region , thus targeting tourists who have high spending power that allows them to travel and spend in the tourist destination country .
he noted that the campaign would also include distribution of promotional leaflets to tourists at beirut airport , including all the special offers of the campaign and the discounts set .
a press conference was held at the phoenicia hotel yesterday , in which , in addition to shaqam , the director general of visa international in the middle east region peter skriven and the regional middle east marketing director brimal patel , took part . the director general from the ministry of tourism attended in place of ilham habballah .
skriven stressed the importance of plastic payment cards in increasing the spending of both tourists and residents in lebanon . he said that lebanon is fast developing as a key tourist destination and " in 2001 a million tourists visited it , an increase of about 13 % on the movement recorded for 2000 " . he pointed out that holders of visa cards spent about 240 million dollars between october 2000 and october 2001 , " bearing in mind that as tourist spending on visa cards increases , the lebanese economy benefits directly " .
he noted that visa international expects , by launching this campaign , to increase the spending of visa card - carrying visitors to lebanon by 25 % during this year .
in turn , shaqam spoke about the number of cards in lebanon . he noted that it had increased by 35 % in the last year , reaching about 200 thousand , with spending at 632 million dollars , namely an increase of 39 % .
he said that the development of electronic payment is closely linked to the infrastructure for these payment operations , " especially electronic cash machines , hotels , restaurants and shops " .
he pointed out that there were about 10 thousand shops in lebanon at present that accept visa cards " but our experience at visa international confirms that there is no ceiling to what the network can become " .
he drew on visa international statistics , noting that travelers around the world prefer to use visa cards to pay instead of cash " and this trend has reached many countries of the middle east as well " .
the director general for tourism by proxy , ilham habballah , praised the initiative of visa international , which she believed brought out the civilization , culture and tourism face of lebanon .
she confirmed that lebanon had made considerable progress in reclaiming its tourism infrastructure .
but she noted the importance of joint responsibility between the ministry of tourism and the private sector for reviving the tourist sector .
i can no longer recall how to flee ; i no longer know how to love you .
my only heart can no longer deceive me .
were the sun less sad , or more patient .
were the towns free from madness , evenings only and women 's songs .
we would not have died a long time ago .
today , i met you by chance .
tomorrow , departure .
the way brought me back to you .
i remember nothing but those laughs .
they alone make me dream of trees and open air .
they wake up a girl swallowed by smooth rocks .
lost among the directions .
a girl uprooted , helpless .
become like the soil divided up by walls .
like the white scattered across the sky and in dust .
i can no longer recall the way to you .
you contain things , but nothing contains you .
wise are you with your breadth and the keys of the heart .
this is the full autumn .
would you not look at me a little and show me some mercy ?
i , who you sleep at night so as not to taste the pains of desire .
pray so as not to end and lose hope .
i dissolve , under the rain .
a wave sweeps me up ; another throws me out .
there is nothing before me but drowning .
i can no longer recall how to flee .
one god is not enough .
one mother is not enough .
one body is not enough .
even you alone are no longer enough .
take your stick and your veils and leave .
brief moments separating us from what we will become .
my father changes the times like clothes .
my horizon is for me alone .
my mother tears apart the chains from the moment the word began .
leave .
it is no different to me whether you or another leaves me .
i will make you , the mirror , laugh by myself .
with another face , another heart .
with records she has hidden and a girl whose voice is free from delusions .
only the mirror is sympathetic to me , gives herself to me .
satisfies my appetite and stirs my body to rise .
only the mirror does not give birth to children , or pictures , or even moons .
she is the red color of the ocean , the roots of the pomegranate tree , awaiting death , the end of time .
i no longer recall your beautiful face .
i have cried by a river as the voice of silence surrounds me , submitting to the beats of your heart .
prepare me the way to the beginning .
penetrate my blood a little ; no one understands my sorrow .
your breathing attracts me like sin .
there is no need for us to monitor the bridges that it penetrates .
when i am with you and think of nothing but the butterflies .
only butterflies .
the novel " additional days " by hasan daud has been published in a german translation by swiss publisher lynus .
the author has been invited to literary seminars in geneva , laussanne , berne and zurich for the occasion .
the translation was carried out by hartmut fendrich , who believed in his introduction that " additional days " was not just a specifically lebanese novel . the reader discovers lebanon as a background , as a screen on which the writer projects his " literary canvas " , which is about human experience : the slow withdrawal and gradual isolation of a man retreating from the world , from his world .
he adds that the reader finds in this work , which has a unique identity ( or approach ) , information about lebanon 's social and political reality .
there is the coming and going between countryside and the city , between the countryside , the place of roots , calm and relaxation , and beirut , the city , the field of work .
this movement is an original lebanese phenomenon , which had lessened over the past decades , but returned to its peak during the war .
the translator continues , saying that the european reader may be surprised at the writer beginning the writing of the novel in 1983 , at the height of the lebanese war , and awaiting the events of that war , which he does not find .
in daud 's first novel , " matild 's building " , the war was still forcefully present and formed part of the novel . you see the main female protagonist , and how the confusion of the war troubles her daily life .
a novel like " additional days " , which was published in arabic in 1990 , would not surprise the reader if the war had been dealt with more intensively .
the translator believes that a rapid review of the development of arabic literature in general since the second world war will help us " categorize " the works of hasan daud , which have a special pathological concern .
since the 1950s many arab writers and educated elite believed literature to be part of or a social - political duty .
the sartre conception of " committed literature " was influential in many ways .
the translator mentions that with the military and political defeat in the 1960s and 1970s , literature lost much of its old stance , the hero became the anti - hero and society became more individualistic .
the translation explains that these examples of change dominated the arab world generally , but egypt and lebanon in particular .
in lebanon , we can find the influence of sartre literature , which has dominated more than that of andre jayyid or proust .
within this framework , it is worth mentioning the most important bases of hasan daud 's writing . findrich says , " as part of these new concepts , we also find the special features of hasan daud 's writing : his focus on the individual and his distancing from society as a socio - political arena , which he only uses as a non - specific framework for the narrative thread . "
from time to time successive activities surface in the city , and invitations to exhibitions , lectures and films increase .
in one week we visited three galleries showing contemporary works .
from the " janin rabiz gallery " exhibiting joseph shahfah ( until the 31st of may ) to " strange fruit " in the starco building exhibiting the sculpture and fitting works of sarah badr ( until the 16th of may ) , to " espace s . d " exhibiting the works of the following male and female artists : rafiq majdhub , ghufdir , hussein madi , greta nofal , munirah al-sulh , rita aun , tinbak and jan and mark nahhas
driven by compassion , joseph shahfah came to lebanon to exhibit his new works in the " janin rabiz gallery ( until the 31st of may ) .
as soon as i enter i feel that i have once again met shahfah , whose workshop i visited in montreal .
here in beirut the works take on a different dimension , especially when the area set aside for each diptych ( pair ) grants them the wide space to extend and grab the attention and reveal the wandering attractions which roam along the corridors , and which result from the twin techniques of tearing and flaying , reminding us of the forced departure and its circumstances .
we scarcely reach the threshold when we are stopped by a painting drowning in yellowness derived from the canary color mixed with white and thrown leisurely above lined expressions linked to mechanical writing or script that is pointed at times and faded at others .
its shadows are black , its rays do not drown the space . nor do they dominate the atmosphere of the painting in its entirety .
robert munsif wrote in montreal about joseph shahfah , " a fabric that hints , an elegant body at the beginning and end of places , at the end and beginning of the seasons .
he takes off his clothes to give to the sun , and the fabric of his nakedness is a station for the universe . the feather takes off its robe . the crossing may be different . the difference could cross whenever the vehicle of colors brings it , whenever the elegance of the candle of tears increases from the birthplace of tears . "
what you want is noise to the extent of a scream , despite the fact that there is no sound in the place other than that of the ventilation machinery , or the movement of a short film tape , which sheds light on the goal of the young sarah badr .
the silence may cover the mouths in these human forms , for the dervish twisting around himself in a mechanical movement awakens in us a feeling of unending movement as long as life runs in the bodies .
a look above to seek spiritual inspiration according to what is expected in this instance , but what surrounds us and is before our eyes denies such existence and underlines the material nature of things and their complete separation from the spiritual plane .
sarah wants this . fine , let her want what she likes . but we have the right to enquire and stare in the darkness of the place and the atmosphere , which is different to the conventional in exhibition halls .
we question what drove her to exhibit paintings that are not of an acceptable standard and to install them as if they were part of a place in which she wished to create a suspicious atmosphere , one that swings between the critical reality and the shadowy embodiment . she did not separate between the two forms and she did not stop even to crystallize what her hands placed on the broad canvas , hung and stretched on bars of metal to a section formed like a washing line , or screen extended to receive the movement of pictures emerging from another source of inspiration .
we support courage and daring but we do not support unfinished work , despite the ambitions evident therein , which call for their right in so many things . would that they slow down to find their path , which might lead them to their goal .
joint exhibitions do not usually create the impression of being new or serious .
there are many who take part with secondary works or those that have been exhibited at least once or twice on different occasions .
but we saw in " espace s .
d " really excellent works .
they are not all of the same standard . our attention was grabbed by the miniature pictures , stuck on wood , with projecting faces beneath thick and thin lines , scattered by red spots giving them their warm life , especially as an elegant script had delineated some of the areas forming the depth of the white space , waiting futilely for an audience that had not come .
when greta nofal plays she " scribbles " something capable of life , of sustainability .
what she exhibits is satisfactory .
tinbak 's packets are nice , although not a discovery . we have seen the like , but they are not lacking in simplicity .
rita aun does not stop simplifying this flourishing , naked body , returning to some childhood , standing on two legs extending to almost swallow up the body .
her two daughters are an incomplete twin fetus within a mother refusing to free it .
the original drama continues to dominate the imagination . the shadows recalls man of the beginning of life , or its bodily or organic transformations , which take one back to a form devoid of defining features .
she digs and chisels this structure , which may become her eternal " human being " that , since the 1990s , has occupied her virgin spaces , which welcome every emergency , but only as part of the conventional , broad outlines .
we do not know why hussein madi became involved in an exhibition that appears to be for young artists or why ghufdir exhibited what was previously shown at the " alice maghabghab gallery " ! nor was there anything new from jan mark nahhas .
the west , under its old label rome , represented an idea that had great influence in the culture of the region .
rome , in the person of its emperor is mentioned in the gospel ( render unto caesar what belongs to caesar ) . it was mentioned by its public name in the quran ( rome has conquered the extremes of the earth ) . the rulers of egypt were also mentioned in the torah as symbols of strength and empire at that time .
at no time and for no race has empire been absent from the religious text . prophets and the metaphysical example they represent have criticized the example of power represented in the most powerful state .
christ clashed with rome in the well - known , famous trial .
there is also the story of the prophet abraham , the companion , with egypt 's pharaoh , in addition to that of moses .
the prophet muhammad also wrote to the king of byzantium , not to mention the wars that took place and the results thereof .
whether rome , the pharaohs or the persians - they are met by an idealized religious awareness that substitutes material power for spiritual strength , the worship of the individual with that of god , the east with the west !
when the muslim arabs entered spain , the ideological cover for this entry was to propagate the islamic faith , despite the fact that the arabs who occupied spain were fleeing from their country in fear of sectarian - authoritarian cleansing .
the first umayyad prince in andalusia was abd al-rahman bin muawiyyah bin hisham bin abd al-malik . abd al-rahman was feeling from abi jaafar al-mansur ! we also find that al-hakam bin hisham , one of the andalusian princes , was described by arab historians as being an " immoderate tyrant with unattractive , wicked consequences " .
notwithstanding the princes who killed other princes , and the fact that some crucified others , nor indeed the conspiracies of children 's women and their uncles .
this was all due to the tyranny that characterized the power of the state , although the cover was the propagation of religion or something similar .
the spread of religion in andalusia bore the same circumstances as the french " mandate " , with the latter representing the great expansion of colonialism and the industrial age .
just as revolutions were mounted against the arab rulers in spain , who were later defeated , revolutions were also mounted at the custodianship and mandate .
but when the arabs were defeated in andalusia , they departed from history .
the terrible structural error committed by the arabs was that they viewed the ottoman occupation of their countries as a conquest . for just as they occupied spain under the cover of the propagation of religion , they also believed that the ottoman occupation constituted protection for their religion . this occupation continued for over four centuries .
and just as the umayyad kings fled fearing the tyranny of the abbasids , and became princes in andalusia , so too the most important reason for the ottoman " conquest " , as we have studied in the curriculum , was the extension of safavid rule in the levant .
power is the same .
in east and west .
the meaning is the same , whether one is propagating a religion or a pack of cigarettes . but the key problem is the message .
in the relationship of the arabs , the most famous , with the west in andalusia , three messages emerged : the first was the aristotelian rationality of ibn rushd ; the second was the sufi " control " and irrationality , by means of sanctifying specific spiritual terms , of muhyi al-din ibn arabi ; and the third was the so - called immorality and permissiveness of the muwashah poetry of that era .
al-ghazali overthrew ibn rushd , who was then pursued and his books burnt , and the syrians declared muhyi al-din bin arabi an infidel .
and then the odes of sex , desire and pleasure were banned .
the second relationship with the west , the broad relationship , is the individual trend represented by people who were original religiously educated ( al-afghani , muhammad abduh , and the many others as is well known ) and others with the entry of the nineteenth century .
marxism from russia .
nationalism from germany .
pragmatism from america .
great slogans and great literature from the whole west , all of rome .
and when the clash took place for a second time , with force , many arab regimes threw the west 's cards into the oven ( the campaigns of treachery following the revolution of the free officers in egypt in 1952 , the campaigns of treachery following 1967 and the most famous example of treachery that took place in the 1980s when shots were fired in all directions ) .
now , at the end of the clash of power , represented in the support of american ( the new rome ! ) for israeli , we find the west 's cards being thrown in the fireplace once more , but it is the people and not the regimes that are doing it , in other words the disease has gotten out of control . ..
rome , which was never absent from the minds of the prophets , needs this level of relationship . once it entered the text , then everyone must know that the matter is complex and dangerous .
how can some come and think that not buying a packet of cigarettes , a pair of jeans or some type of food is a good way of dealing with rome / america ?
rome , which was not left out by the sacred text , is the historical level of power .
the power that was sought by the prophet , of which he dreamt . and the adapted story will be formed with astonishing historical precision when we hear of " soldiers " from god fighting .
these imaginary soldiers are the metaphysical alternatives to rome .
everyone dreams of power , of empire .
from an unknown direction the aggressor attacks the empire as he attacks his dream , his own rome .
at this juncture , once more , we understand the words of christ , in their reserve .
" render unto caesar what belongs to caesar " . power , empire and american cannot be understood except in this sense , at the level of a prophet .
only the prophets can deal well with rome . ..
93 university lecturers have signed a petition announcing their boycott of cultural and research relations with israel , asking their academic and cultural peers , including israelis , to join with them . they believe that western civil society must " move to stand in the face of the crimes and massacres perpetrated against the palestinian people as long as western governments remain silent towards them " .
the petition read : " despite the widespread international condemnation of the violent policy of the israeli government towards the palestinian people in the occupied territories , it appears to be unconcerned by the moral calls addressed to it by world leaders .
the matter is clear . whilst palestinians are demanded to control their extremists , the israelis bring their extremists to power .
the slow , inhuman and harsh policy of settlement in the west bank and gaza strip , which has continued at the same level over the last few years , has taken a terrible and destructive turn and gnawed at a large percentage of palestinian territory .
for how long will we , citizens of western democracy , accept the silence of our government in the face of the recalcitrance of the israeli army in the west bank ?
when will we examine the israeli war crimes perpetrated on a daily and regular basis as more than an isolated act , but as a national political issue ?
in the face of the inability of our government or its unwillingness to move , civil society must take its step to exercise pressure against the continuation of the barbaric settlement process , which implicitly contains a historical difference .
at a time of globalization , our passiveness as citizens in the world towards such inhumanity smears us (...)
we hope that our colleagues will not attend conferences in israel , and will put pressure on our universities to suspend any exchange operation existing , any preparations for cooperation or any distribution of study grants .
we note that in light of the opposition of some academics and cultural elite in israel to the israeli government , with the participation of others in israeli - palestinian research projects , the vast majority of them have offered support for the wicked attack of the israeli army on the palestinians , or have failed to make their opposition effective or have any impact .
the boycott we propose will be effective , active and will also extend to those who do not deserve it . we regret that this will happen .
we ask our israeli colleagues and friends to join with us .
they know , as do we , that they will suffer from this boycott . but this is nothing if we compare it to the continuation of the suffering of the palestinian people and palestinian academics .
as happened in the days of the boycott of the policy of racial discrimination in south africa , what is required now is a rapid international move to stop the massacres against the palestinian people . "

the first of the pictures hanging on the wall of the sarsaq museum edited by the brazilian photographer carlos farrer on " marguerite yourcenar the last journey " that attracted my attention was the watercolor surrounded by plants which bore the date of birth of the great writer . but the date of death remained blank , and under it there was an expression from her , she who came to her grave before her death :
" my joy is for the one who spreads the heart of man over the destiny of a whole life . "
one day before the opening of the exhibition " marguerite yourcenar , the last journey " by the artist carlos fareer , which was coordinated on the occasion of the francophone year by the sarsaq museum , the french cultural mission and the nadia tuwini institute , we met carlos fareer at a press conference , which included his live and progress before he allocated the most important paragraph of his speech to marguerite yourcenar and his artistic , literary and humanitarian relationship with her .
the meeting was opened by alan fukih , cultural advisor to the french embassy , who said , " the photographs are of prime importance in the francophone year of 2002 .
the photographs will be exhibited in beirut and sidon as major events on this occasion .
carlos fareer is a brazilian resident in paris , and is viewed to be among the greatest photographers in the world . after a year he had new views of cities like alexandria . he was accompanied on its streets by the french writer of egyptian origin robert suli , and venice and india on the way to atus mountain ... and today , after the city of aleppo , there is beirut in the lens of his mind .
he has pointed this lens of his at writers , poets and artists among the great people of this age , such as orson wells , francis bacon , truffaut , ghudar and laurence durrell . .."
fareer was then given the opportunity to speak . he started his speech with a glance at beirut where he had just arrived , but he still felt hospitality , a welcome and warmth immediately .
" if it entered my mind that lebanon would be my next project , it would be because on my way to the sarsaq museum from my hotel , where i was welcomed like a prince , i was dazzled by the light . this light that will enter into the heart of the matter . "
he then referred to the war years , " this city , which has suffered from war and violence for years , has surprised me with the people 's life and vitality and motion of existence . "
where did carlos farrer 's life begin ?
" in 1968 i left rio de janeiro and traveled to paris .
my father , the publisher , put me in a warm atmosphere of books .
however my life as a photographer came automatically based on a passion for photography . i photographed hitchcock , truffaut and ghudar from the cinema .
i loved this world and worked in it for a time . it was my sole study of the photographic art .
and with every artist or sculptor or author it was as if through my pictures i were drawing a book of life . "
how did carlos farrer come to know marguerite yourcenar ?
" the producer jean montalbeti asked me to edit a set of photographs of the meeting that would take place between marguerite yourcenar and the cinema actor dominick sanda by recording on a tape with the title " darham hilm " .
this recording was to be included in a television program on yourcenar and her writings at her base , petite blizans .
during my first meeting with her she asked me : " mr. farrer , where are you from ? "
this question led to a number of meetings .
i told her about my brazilian roots , about the amazon indians and the indians of america .
she listened attentively .
we did not speak about literature , even though i was in front of a major writer with her unique status .
on the day she came to france i prepared for her a visit to the sulfur sciences museum in the horticultural gardens to see the set of stones of rojet kayua , whom she succeeded in the french academy .
our conversations took place against the background of photography .
from paris to london and then america on her island , mon desire .
in 1988 i had to meet her at the beginning of the year in a hotel in new delhi , her station before she went to nepal , but she died on the 17th of december . "
how were her daily dealings with her friends ?
" she was very simple .
one day she asked me to bring for her from paris a recording collection of the argentinean tango .
she refused not to pay me the small sum .
marguerite yourcenar made her own bread .
she was spontaneous in her actions , just and truthful . "
has this exhibition toured places other than lebanon ?
" it includes 32 pictures and was welcomed for the first time by the pompidou center in paris where it was visited by five hundred thousand people .
it then moved to many capitals around the world .
to avoid resorting to manufactured comments under every picture , we have chosen from her writings texts which illustrate the picture in her meditations . "
a tour among the exhibited pictures points us to marguerite yourcenar 's books " memoirs of adrian " , " an obscure man " , " the viewing eyes " , and one expression that says : " we have lost the feeling that love , or more simply expressed , that the sensual relationships , and even daily relationships , are holy . "
the mar elias maronite sisters of the holy family secondary school in al-batrun opened an exhibition of books and literary publications under the title " reading is the food of the spirit and intellectual development " . it was attended by the deputy patriarch general to the diocese of al-jubbah , bishop francis al-bisri , director of the convent , mother josephine wahbah , members of the teaching staff and a large number of pupils ' families and interested persons .
after the national anthem , mother wahbah made a speech in which she drew attention to the fact that competition suffered by books from the media and from information technology was strong . she believed that these methods call for a spread of culture and education openly , but they produce a superficial simple culture if they are misused .
after that the head of the teaching staff association , mr. tamir ziyadah , also spoke , insisting on the need to return to reading and that lebanon should remain a center of intellectual light in spite of all the difficulties surrounding us .
he insisted that a country that does not concern itself with culture and does not encourage the educated is no longer to be reckoned a nation accepted among the nations .
the general board of the al-sharaa intellectual forum will hold an electoral meeting in antilias at half past seven on the evening of monday , the 27th of this may , in the lecture hall of the church of the archangel michael in antilias , in order to choose the first board of management of the forum for its new launch , one year after the renewal of its license , knowledge and news .

he announced , " the directorate general of antiquities at the ministry of culture carried out works to qualify the archaeological site in jubail , with the assistance of the canadian province of quebec . the site has become easier and clearer for the development of history and architecture to be understood in jubail from the neolithic age to the present time , passing through all the stages through which jubail passed through over more than seven thousand years . a museum has been established inside the citadel , which will be opened shortly .
the ministry has also placed some property acquired from the directorate general of antiquities at the disposal of the municipality , for it be transformed into a reception and information center for tourists , as part of a comprehensive plan for the jubail , kasrawan and al-batrun areas . "
" drug - taking in lebanon : where are we ? " was the title of the national conference held yesterday in the al-basharah orthodox school in al-ashrafiyyah at the invitation of the united nations office for combating drugs and crime prevention , in cooperation with the research and field applications development association for psychiatric health ( idrak ) and the psychiatry and psychology department at saint jawarjius hospital .
the conference was opened by a representative from the ministry of the interior , judicial police commander brigadier samir subh , who said that 2002 was the year for eliminating drugs from lebanon . "
he spoke of the efforts of the security services , which had led to " the arrest of more than 1500 persons accused of dealing in and promoting drugs in 2001 , in addition to operations to destroy fields in which poppies are grown , which have continued since last month , especially in the beqaa plain . "
he added , " not long ago , in the presence of the local and foreign media , we destroyed every field in which hashish and opium were growing , covering an area of almost ten million square meters .
all of this was accompanied by an organized media campaign to make people aware of the dangers of drugs and to distinguish between the criminal merchant and the addicted victim . "
the regional representative for the middle east and north africa in the united nations program for combating drugs and crime prevention , dr. mahdi ali , then spoke . he said , " the conference will discuss the study prepared by the idrak association on the nature of drug taking and its spread and forms in lebanon . "
he believed that the study " constituted a pioneering example of interaction between the efforts of the security services and the efforts of relevant ministries and non - governmental private associations " . he confirmed , " the efforts to deal with the problem will not achieve success unless they focus on reducing supply and reducing demand . "
he added , " the reduction in supply is represented by the efforts of the ministry of the interior and specialized security services to destroy plantations and stop production and circulation . the reduction in demand is represented by the efforts of numerous parties , including the ministries of health and social affairs and non - governmental organizations . "
he said , " the united nations program has provided support , represented in training courses , means of transportation , a strengthening of the forensic laboratory and support for judicial legislation .
regarding the elimination of plantations , we have provided a sum of 6.5 million dollars for alternative development in the beqaa plain . "
he added that the united nations program is about to announce a new program in this area and discussion had started with donor countries providing finance .
the opening ceremony was attended by deputies atif majdalani and antoine haddad , and father dimitri khuri , representing the roman orthodox bishop of beirut , ilias awdah .
the head of the idrak association charged with preparing the study , dr. eli karam , introduced the study , " which lasted two years . it is the first to deal with the size of the problem in lebanon . " he added , " recommendations will be issued for the drafting of a plan we will submit to the government , for it to take the necessary measures in the areas of protection and legislation . "
the idrak association based its study on a number of investigative field studies , with the aim of determining the types of drug and sedative use .
the study included a sample of students in the secondary departments of schools and universities . it said , " the comparative percentage of drug taking between secondary school pupils and university students has doubled from 1991 to 1999 at least . " the study also revealed , " the average age for starting use varies from 14 to 17 years . "
the sample included drug takers in treatment , reception and training centers , persons arrested , people imprisoned for this reason and users on the street . it confirmed , " heroin is the substance responsible for most cases requiring treatment ( 65 per cent ) , followed by cocaine ( 17 per cent ) and sedatives ( 10 per cent ) ."

lisbon - from rali muawwad :
the international osteoporosis federation has opened its conference , attended by more than 6 thousand doctors from numerous countries , at the conference palace in lisbon , the portuguese capital .
president of the federation professor pierre delmas spoke about the tasks of the international osteoporosis federation and ways to assist local associations to disseminate information on this disease and provide assistance in discovering the causes and ways of treatment . he greeted the honorary president of the federation queen rania al-abdullah and mrs. nazik el - hariri , the first international ambassador of the international osteoporosis federation and chairman of club 206 ( i . e . the number of the bones in the skeleton ) .
queen rania spoke , focusing on two messages . the first had the aim of strong bones to build a strong life and guaranteed future for individuals and communities .
she said , " the war on osteoporosis aims to liberate many people , most of them women , from a disease that restricts their lives .
for the younger of them it impedes daily activity and prevents productivity . for the older it hinders their life to a much greater extent , especially given that the costs of health care and treatment are high (...).
this disease sometimes causes problems that lead to death (...). therefore we must act quickly to coordinate everyone 's efforts . "
she added , " the second message is the power of joint work between the doctor , the patient and the researcher .
cooperation is essential if we wish to meet the challenge .
assistance must also come from the patient and those who help him . there are today 139 national associations in 71 countries who are members of the international osteoporosis federation . they spread knowledge , change health legislation , provide material support and educate the community . "
she spoke about jordan and the role of the jordanian association in spreading awareness and education and in organizing conferences and information campaigns and school programs to educate pupils and teach them ways of building strong bones .
she said , " when we see a number of people who can be assisted , we sense the difficulty of our work .
our work together achieves greater successes in gaining comprehensive knowledge of osteoporosis (...) together we will be the force for change . "
during the conference there was a round table for women chaired by queen rania and managed by a member of the european parliament , mel reed . she started by presenting a commemorative placard to mrs. nazik al-hariri , following her appointment as first ambassador for the international osteoporosis federation out of regard for her efforts in club 206 , which now has 30 members who are working to assist in combating osteoporosis .
mrs. nazik al-hariri , who lead a lebanese delegation which included the president of the lebanese osteoporosis association , maha mikawi , and mrs. huda tabara and mrs. rima taqi al-din .
she said , " i am pleased and honored to be among you today in this gathering of persons distinguished in the world of medicine , journalism and charitable work .
when i agreed to launch the campaign to combat osteoporosis i was eager to relieve a wide sector of our societies , especially those most in need of assistance , of the effects of this disease and the suffering it causes .
this is out of my belief that what man does in this area and in other charitable areas he will do for god 's pleasure , without seeking thanks or recognition .
it gives me pleasure that this campaign , launched under the 206 slogan , has received a response from notable personalities in our community which was at the level of the invitation , and they have responded with sympathy and generosity to enable our initiative to succeed .
this has helped to support the awareness campaign and strengthen the ability to pursue scientific research into this disease . it has also assisted national associations to treat those suffering from it without distinction by race or religion . "
the first round table for leading women in the world included discussions that confirmed the need to address officials in all countries of the world to call for assistance in diagnosis , treatment and prevention .
two doctors , ghassan maaluf and basil al-masri , spoke about osteoporosis in the middle east .
maaluf explained a study he had conducted in the saint jawarjius hospital on fractures of the hip and of the spine in lebanon . he noted that the results of this study had been studied by professor junel in sweden and professor ego seeman in australia and would be published soon .
an exhibition of photographs carrying the signature of olivero toskani of osteoporosis sufferers was held .
finally , it should be noted that in october 2003 lebanon will host the second conference on osteoporosis in mediterranean countries .
shortly before they left the island of cyprus for european union states that have indicated a readiness to receive them , the 13 exiled palestinians , whom israel views as " very dangerous " , demanded that they be brought together in one country . the response was : " your distribution across a number of countries is necessary for security reasons . "
the exiles responded with one voice , " no matter how beautiful the country to which we are being exiled , nothing will compensate us for the homeland . "
these men were placed under heavy security guard on the top floor of the " flamingo beach " hotel in the tourist city of larnaca .
the " flamingo " hotel may have come under the microscope and entered the memory of palestine following the arrival of the thirteen palestinians there directly from the church of the nativity in bethlehem , of which millions dream of lowering their heads to enter its door , which is no taller than one hundred and thirty centimeters . but lebanon had prepared for this memory some years ago .
when war broke out on the 13th of april 1975 , this hotel became a refuge for the lebanese , who lived there for years and left between its walls their dreams and tears .
perhaps history is repeating itself and confirming the link between the catastrophe of the lebanese and palestinian peoples .
tens of times has the greek phrase for " welcome " rung in my ears whenever i have set foot on the land of the natural island close to lebanon . it was the first possible land when the flames of war spread and burnt the lives of the lebanese and those living in our land .
cyprus . . . larnaca . . . there is . .. " mackenzie " street , the street of the lebanese emigrants . . . and the " flamingo " hotel , oasis of safety .
at this hotel the lebanese used to tell their tales and sufferings . tears were mixed with deep signs . news of the homeland shook the calm of the night in this quiet city . the cypriots welcomed the bags and the lebanese faces redolent with the confusion of the immigrant .
it is the " hotel of lebanon " and the lebanese .
it was a stop for tens of thousands of them during the lebanese war , including politicians , media figures , artists , businessmen and ordinary citizens .
three minutes separate it from larnaca airport .
three minutes separate it from the sea that links us to the dear homeland .
a large number of lebanese used to resort to it to take refuge from the fatigue of travel before leaving for the countries of the world . it was also a waiting stop for those returning by steamship to the homeland .
how many people met friends whom they had not seen since childhood . how many families met and discovered that their members were alive after contacts between people collapsed during the dark days .
the owner of the hotel at the time was former cypriot minister " mr. batikhi " .
he loved lebanon and was one of the shipping agents that transported the lebanese to their home .
if the " flamingo " hotel was a place of temporary residence , the " terrace " restaurant opposite " scotch corner " was the venue for discussions , meetings , contacts , thought and planning for the future . the great question was :
should we return ?
and when will the war stop ?
the war has moved on to palestine and history is repeating itself , albeit symbolically ! the number 13 was linked to the outbreak of the lebanese war . today it is linked to the 13 palestinian exiles , who left the church of the nativity by a door 130 cm high . ..
what is this distinguishing mark ?
what is this fate ?
what does the historical reference mean ?
in cyprus lies part of lebanon 's history . in the flamingo many of us left our tears , confusions and pictures of the faces of families and companions , hands waving goodbye and greeting . in larnaca lies the body of my grandmother who died in 1995 in a house situated a few steps behind that hotel . she was buried in the town and still lies there .
" good trip to lebanon " was the last phrase i heard from one of the flamingo 's staff in the summer of 1994 , saying goodbye and waving his hand .
i whispered in gratitude , " afkharyesto , afkharyesto . "
but i 'm not traveling to my homeland . i 'm emigrating to my fate .

he said of the breaches and misuse of federation funds attributed to him by his fellow countryman secretary - general of the federation michel zen ruffinen , " it saddens me more than it disappoints me (...) that these serious charges should be brought against me , especially after my 27th year of activity in a federation that i have served to the best of my ability . "
he confirmed , " i did not do these things .
i did not hide files and the charge that i acted criminally is silly . "
in a report to the executive committee of the international federation , zen ruffinen had claimed that blatter had paid the sum of 25 thousand dollars to nigerian referee lucien bouchardeau from the funds of the federation for information about the president of the somali football federation and the vice president of the african football federation " caf " , farah addo , who accused the president of " fifa " of buying votes to guarantee his success in the 1998 election , when he defeated the president of the european football federation " uefa " , swede lennart johansson .
he also accused him of paying 100 thousand dollars to the member of the executive committee , viacheslav koloskov , as compensation for a period when he was not a member of the committee .
on the basis of this report , 11 members of the committee , including five vice presidents , at the forefront of whom was johansson , brought a case against their president before the swiss courts in zurich last friday .
in his press conference blatter responded by saying that he had paid a sum of money to bouchardeau but that it was from his private funds .
the nigerian referee previously revealed yesterday in a press interview that he had asked the help of the " fifa " president to confront personal problems . he had responded and written him a cheque from his personal account . as far as the 100 thousand dollar payment to koloskov was concerned , he confirmed that he should not have allowed it to be paid without the knowledge of the finance committee of the international federation .

he believed that the building of new settlements was " provocative and created discord " and the settlers were " free to throw themselves into violence and confiscate territory " .
he mentioned international agreements , including the geneva convention , which prohibits the colonization of occupied territory .
he observed that whilst israel claimed that settlement expansion was " natural " in view of the population increase , the number of settlers rose by 12 % each year , whilst the population increase was no more than 2 % .
he noted , " the effective and long - term planting of jewish settlements serves the aim of controlling territory and natural resources , and of reducing the living area available to the palestinian people who are hosts . "
he criticized the destruction of homes during israeli incursions as happened in the battle for jenin camp , believing that this aimed to " create the maximum physical and moral suffering " .
he confirmed that israel was responsible for " the misuse and waste of water resources " .
he quoted israeli human right groups with whom he is still in contact since his recent visit as saying that thousands of homes had been destroyed and thousands others were threatened .
he announced that he had sought the assistance of the israeli authorities during his visit , which he described as " academic " , but its policy " was not to deal with him " and " i believe that the reason for this was that they did not have adequate answers " .
the " associated press " agency quoted the israeli representative to the united nations headquarters in geneva , ya ' akov levy , as saying that kothari 's " accusations " were " one - sided " .
he said that he had traveled to the region " on false pretexts " , without israeli permission , to investigate the palestinian situation for the united nations , in fact " to examine the case only as a partisan individual " .
he noted , " the issue of settlements is political , over which israel and the palestinians differ (...) we have submitted detailed proposals to resolve these problems , but the palestinians severed the talks .
the reasons for the difficulties is the deliberate palestinian decision not to work with us and resort to the policy of violence . "
it is noted that since 1967 israel has built more than one hundred settlements , giving refuge to about 200 thousand people .
it claims that the land on which they are built is the subject of a dispute and not occupied , and that the geneva convention does not therefore apply .

a palestinian was shot dead by israeli soldiers guarding the qadumim settlement in the west bank . the israeli army detained three people in hebron and entered the town of bir zeit near ramallah .
an israeli military spokesman reported that a palestinian was killed when he attacked an israeli settler with a knife near the qadumim settlement in the northern west bank .
he clarified that the incident took place in front of a garage in the settlement , which is located to the west of nablus .
the settler , who was wearing a bullet - proof jacket , was wounded in the hand and opened fire with his revolver on the palestinian .
soldiers who were guarding the settlement also opened fire on the palestinian .
three female palestinians who were in a taxi suffered slight wounds from machine gun fire from an israeli tank in the jenin sector in the northern west bank .
eight people , among them seven women , were in a taxi when the israeli tank opened fire , according to the taxi driver , isam samar .
the incident took place in kafr dan at a distance of about three kilometers to the north west of jenin .
the three women were taken to the hospital in the town .
the israeli soldiers claimed that they opened fire because the driver refused to stop , but the latter insisted that he received no order to stop .
the driver was able to leave the site after the soldiers searched his car .
an israeli military spokesman stated that on the night of thursday to friday a small israeli unit had entered the area subject to palestinian authority in hebron , arrested three persons and destroyed " a workshop for the manufacture of explosives " after they had found detonators and equipment for the manufacture of explosives inside .
the israeli authorities are accusing the three persons of participating in attacks on israel .
palestinian security sources have said that the unit , consisting of a personnel carrier and jeeps , entered the isa district in the western sector of the town where it destroyed an empty house .
the unit arrested the palestinians , fadi duwaik and rabi shuwaikah and took them away with them .
the soldiers arrested the third palestinian in the village of dura , close to hebron . he was ayyad al-rayyan , an officer in the palestinian security service and member of the fateh movement .
amnesty international organization , which has its headquarters in london , has called upon the palestinian authority to release the secretary general of the people 's front for the liberation of palestine , ahmad saadat , " immediately " , and has also called upon israel not to threaten his life if he leaves prison .
israel accuses saadat , who is imprisoned in jericho in the context of international monitoring , of giving the order for the assassination of the israeli minister of tourism , rahabaam zaifi , last october .
on the 3rd of last june the palestinian high court of justice ordered the release of saadat , but the palestinian leadership decided to keep him in prison following the issue of israeli threats against him .
the amnesty international organization , in a statement to the palestinian authority , has urged it " to adhere to this judgment and release saadat immediately . "
it has also urged israel to " guarantee that it will not subject ahmad saadat to extra - judicial measures , in particular his assassination . "
it also demanded the united states and britain ( the two countries which are participating in guarding saadat in the prison in jericho ) adhere to their obligations to israel and the palestinian authority equally .
the organization says that it is essential to release saadat because no charge has been made against him and he has not appeared in any court since he was arrested on the 15th of last january .
saadat was transported with five other palestinians on the first of last may from the headquarters of the palestinian leader , yasir arafat , in ramallah , to a prison in jericho under an israeli / palestinian / american agreement , which allowed the israeli siege of arafat 's headquarters to be lifted .
arafat 's advisor , nabil abu radinah , announced that the israeli policy of segregation and the establishment of segregated areas " will not have any value . "
he added , " this policy will lead to further tension in the region . "
he said that " it is not allowed " to build a wall on borders other than those of the 4th of june . "
he stressed , " what is allowed is a wall on the basis of the full borders of the fourth of june 1967 , including al-quds (...) the policy of building walls and segregated areas cannot be accepted . "
he explained that the way to security and peace would come " through israeli withdrawal from palestinian territory , cessation of aggression in all its forms and the establishment of an independent palestinian state . "
israeli radio quoted israeli minister of defense binyamin ben eliezer on thursday as saying that the building works for a protective wall along the length of the line of contact between israeli territory and the west bank will begin on sunday .
the israeli ministry of defense announced on tuesday that the construction works should begin " at the end of the week or the beginning of the coming week " between the two towns of kafr salim and kafr qasim .
the radio said that the wall between kafr qasim , close to the coastal plain , and kafr salim , in the north would extend for 110 kilometers , and its construction would end within six months .

following the undertaking given by american president george bush to deploy the missile defense system as soon as possible to protect the united states and its allies , and his confirmation that washington is cooperating in this area with moscow by means of finally burying the anti - ballistic missile treaty " abm " on the date his country withdraws from it , russian minister of defense serge ivanov clarified that the existence of a missile defense system was " hypothetical " and not a reality and that there could be no justification for speaking of a response from moscow . the russian foreign ministry has adopted the view that the " start 2 " treaty has been revoked .
bush gave notice that the " abm " treaty would end officially on thursday . washington had announced that it would withdraw from it on the 13th of december 2001 , giving six months notice .
the united states signed this treaty with the former soviet union in 1972 .
a statement issued by the american president said , " as the events of 11 september demonstrated , we are not living in the world of the cold war , for which the abm treaty was designed .
now we face threats from terrorists who plan to destroy our civilization using any means available to mercenary states possessing weapons of mass destruction and long - range missiles . "
he said , " the defense of the american people against these risks is my biggest priority in my capacity as general commander (...) i am giving an undertaking to deploy the anti - missile defense system as soon as possible to protect the american people and our forces deployed abroad against the developing ballistic threat .
they may also threaten our allies and friends across the world . we must work together to defend against them . this is a major task that the abm treaty was impeding . "
during the recent summit between bush and his russian counterpart vladimir putin in moscow , they discussed means of cooperation in the area of counter - missile defense by expanding the scope of military exercises and speeding up the deployment of a joint early warning system against ballistic missiles .
in an indication of bush 's determination to proceed with his plan regarding the missile defense system , the american ministry of defense , the " pentagon " , is moving to prepare the restricted area of fort greeley in alaska to build six underground missile bunkers .
on the russian side , ivanov said , " the american missile defense system only exists hypothetically , not in reality .
there is therefore no justification for talk about revenge measures . "
but he adopted putin 's stance that withdrawal from a treaty that had provided guarantees for strategic stability for 30 years was a mistake .
a statement issued by the russian foreign minister said that moscow had come to view the " start 2 " disarmament treaty signed in january 1993 with the united states as revoked after " russia had noted the absence of a number of elements preventing implementation of start 2 , and no longer considers itself to be bound by it " .
this is the first time that moscow has announced the revocation of " start 2 " , which observers essentially believe that bush and putin 's agreement to reduce nuclear warheads had rendered obsolete .
elsewhere , a successful test was conducted over the pacific ocean of a missile fired from the sea to bring down medium - range warheads .
the " standard missile 3 " interceptor was fired from the american destroyer " lake erie " collided with a model of a self - propelled missile fired eight minutes earlier from kaua , hawaii .
the tests showed that a missile guided by a radar system could bring down a medium or long - range missile in specific circumstances .
officials at the ministry of defense reported that the objective of the test was not to simulate reality but to gather information that would help to develop anti - missile systems that could be based on ships and to test their capability to bring down an inter - continental missile .

the only person accused by the united states of involvement in the 11 september attacks , french national of moroccan origin zacaria moussaoui , denied before the court that he had contacted the hijackers of the aircraft that crashed into the twin towers of the world trade center in new york and the american ministry of defense building , the " pentagon " , in washington .
he confirmed that he possessed secret information that would force his release .
on thursday he won the right to defend himself in the court and paved the way for a dramatic end to the session with repeated pleas to give him " ten minutes , five minutes , two minutes " to explain why " the court would be forced to withdraw the case today " .
the plaintiffs believe that moussaoui , aged 34 , may have trained to be the 20th hijacker but he told the judge at the alexandria court in the state of virginia , leonie brinkema , that the government " knows that i was not in contact with those people , who hijacked the aircraft " , bearing in mind that he was arrested on the 16th of last august in minnesota after officials at a flying school doubted that he was a student .
in a broken but singular english accent , the french citizen referred to secret information that might help him in his case .
he said that the american government " knew who i was when i entered the united states " , as a result of information that it had seen after the british authorities stormed his previous address in 1998 in london .
he did not mention any information possessed by the united state and how it could establish his innocence .
the government 's attorneys did not respond to what he said .
the american authorities confirmed that they were trying to secure the death sentence for moussaoui if he is found guilty of the charges brought against him , which are conspiracy to perpetrate a terrorist act , hijack an aircraft , destroy an aircraft , use weapons of mass destruction , kill american government officials and destroy property .
concerning his representation of himself before the court , the judge said that moussaoui 's request was " unwise but rational " . the psychiatrist appointed by the court confirmed that the accused was not suffering from a mental illness .
however , she said that the defense team would continue now to help him .
defense attorney frank dunham noted that " it was not fair to him " that the lawyers should continue with the case in these circumstances .
he said that moussaoui was not behaving rationally .
moussaoui confirmed the danger of the situation , saying : " i fully understand the system of american justice and that i will not see light again .
i understand this .
but it is impossible for me to put my life in another 's hands .
my life is in danger and i will not gamble . "

with the syrian representative to the united nations , ambassador mikhail wahbah , heading the first public meeting that the security council has decided to hold in six months to discuss the middle east crisis , washington has warned damascus , which it believes violates the resolutions of the council unless it takes measures against terrorist groups .
the assistant american representative to the united nations , ambassador james cunningham , told his syrian counterpart , " we must speak clearly .
it is necessary to stop providing a safe haven to those who fund , plan , support and mount terrorist activities . this is the decision of the security council on the basis of chapter seven ( of the united nations charter ) and is included in resolution number 1373 . "
chapter seven gives the security council the authority to impose sanctions on member states who do not comply with its resolutions and to issue an order to mount military action if the sanctions are insufficient .
this american position was stated after the israeli representative , ambassador yahuda lankari , sharply attacked syria , accusing it of inciting terrorism and treating international law with contempt , thereby rendering it unfit to hold a seat on the security council , " not to mention chairing it " .
he said , " syria , whose representative currently holds the chairmanship of the security council , continues to support acts of violence against israeli citizens . "
the syrian representative responded to lankari , accusing israel of escalating its attacks on his country " to cover up the crimes , destruction and terrorism " perpetrated by it against the right of palestinian struggle for an independent state " .
he added that syria , which was elected to the membership of the council , would not " stoop to this low level of diplomacy " .
wahbah addressed lankari and the palestinian representative , nasir al-qudwah , with the same expressions , despite the fact that some representatives had expected him to use the same courtesies towards israel .
whatever the case , wahbah dropped the description " noble " when addressing lankari in favor of the expression " representative of israel " , as he did with all the speakers .
lankari quoted damascus radio 's commendation of " the extraordinary and excellent suicide attacks " .
he said that syria had allowed " terrorist " organizations , such as " islamic jihad " to adopt damascus as their headquarters , had occupied lebanon and feigned forgetfulness of the " mass killing " of its people in 1982 when its forces bombed the town of hamah .
however , wahbah said that all countries had the right to condemn terrorism " except israel " , which practiced terrorism against the palestinians .

in a report recently prepared at the request of the " international and strategic studies center " ( ) in washington , former american diplomat and noted expert on middle east affairs , anthony cordesman , warns of the risks of stereotyping the problems that may face the united states in its rapprochement with the middle east region , at the level of both its relations there and its war on " terror " .
at the beginning of his report , which is to be published soon and a copy of which has been examined by " al-nahar " , cordesman says , " the only way by which the united states will be able to engage in a rapprochement with the region and successfully understand it is for it to understand its complexities and avoid facile and dangerous stereotypes .
there are between 21 and 23 states in the middle east , which extend from the arab maghrib to the arabian peninsula and iran .
there is one element that joins together all these countries on the map ( with one exception , israel ) , namely islam .
all these countries are viewed as backward in terms of international development , including the more well - off oil states , because oil is not an alternative to a balanced and diverse economy .
most of these countries are facing a sharp population increase : the population between 1950 and 1980 rose from 174 million to 290 million and is expected to reach 390 million in 2015 .
increase in growth achieved since 1965 is almost non - existent .
according to estimates by the world bank actual development in the whole region is no more than 0.5 % over 35 years .
cordesman expands his description of the region , saying , " all these countries have witnessed fundamental social changes by virtue of their transformation from societies based on agriculture to urban - based societies .
this has broken traditional economic structures and led to major changes in the family , the tribe , the clan and social life .
between 1950 and 1980 population in the cities increased from 27 % to 48 % .
between 1980 and 1999 the number of people living in the cities rose from 84 million to 169 million , i . e . from 48 % to 58 % of the total population .
most inhabitants of the middle east states are young : for every ten people , four have an average age of 14 or below .
the result is that massive numbers of young people are entering the labor market every year without having the educational level necessary to help transform the economies of these countries into modern economies able to compete .
unemployment levels for young people aged between 18 and 25 exceed 30 % .
in many middle east countries women face major barriers preventing them from contributing with their full capability in the movement of society .
emigration is rife . statistics indicate that the percentage of young people wanting to migrate to the west touches on 70 % ."
cordesman attributes the failure of countries of the region to achieve development to " the failure of secular ideologies to provide economic and political solutions .
arab nationalism , socialism , communism and capitalism have all failed .
furthermore , no arab leader has succeeded in inheriting the standing of gamal abd al-nasser . no arab leader can compensate for the defeats of the arab - israeli war , the economic stumble and the ongoing retreat from international standing .
even the iranian revolution , which started as a symbol of the struggle between the people of the region and totalitarian regimes supported by the united states , has ended with a popular contradiction , embodied in the election of president muhammad khatimi , and delayed the state on account of the struggle between the reformist and conservative sides .
there are other factors , which have made the situation more complex : the arab - israeli wars continue in the form of the second palestinian intifada , and in the reality of the images of israeli tanks attacking palestinian youths and the processions of arab funerals , which have become a symbol of american support for israeli oppression .
the iran - iraq war left a permanent legacy : the widespread use of weapons of mass destruction .
secondly , what the arabs views as a united states - led policy , which aims to impoverish the iraqi people . "
on political islam , cordesman says , " the pressures arising from religious tensions in a number of states , such as those of north africa , bahrain , iraq , lebanon , saudi arabia and yemen , have increased dramatically . "
there are types of tension : in algeria with the ruling regime .
in bahrain , saudi arabia and iraq , tensions between sunnis and shiites .
in yemen , interference between religious and tribal facets .
these factors explain the beginning of the move in a number of areas to religion , in search of security and hope .
this steady change has been taking place for a long time . its proponents seek economic and social betterment within a framework of safeguarding religious practices .
in short , it can be said that the failure of secularism and the growth of islam have led to the emergence of extremist islamic movements in every state in which the existing regime practices suppression to prevent change in power . "

the american expert concludes by saying that the united states should not fall into facile generalization .
it must deal with each state in the region on an individual basis .
similarly , with " terrorist " groups , on the basis of avoiding categorizing them as one group .
america must establish joint security cells with the governments of the region in order to fight " terrorist organizations " .

the pressing question in the middle east a few weeks ago was : when will zakaria speak for the white house ? but now it is : what will he say ?
since george bush declared on the 4th of last april his vision for the establishment of a palestinian state alongside israel as the only point of entry for settlement in the middle east , many await an objective translation to implement this vision in the form of a solution , when ariel sharon is bent not only on destroying palestinian towns but on destroying that vision specifically .
two weeks ago this vision was put under a hot flame when it was said that bush was shifting towards announcing a conception for a solution based on " a program for settlement and a schedule " . this set matters alight on two fronts :
first , the front of consultations conducted by the american president with officials in the region , whether via diplomatic envoys , the last of whom was william burns , or by his meeting with saudi crown prince abdallah , followed by egyptian president hosni mubarak and ariel sharon , as with king abdallah ii and , the day before yesterday , prince saud al-faisal .
secondly , the front of predictions and interesting contradictions arising from american statements , which have reflected a major difference in the past few days , to the extent that bush seems to be speaking in the west with his secretary of state , colin powell , speaking in the east .
thus , as powell announced a few days ago that it was certain that there would be an " international conference " to study the establishment of a temporary (!) palestinian state as a step towards the establishment of a palestinian state , ari fleischer , spokesman for the white house , hurried to clarify that this was not an american proposal but one of many ideas being discussed between bush and the leaders of the region whom he had visited .
at the same time as powell stressed that " the international conference " would be held in the second half of next july under " my chairmanship " , bush told journalists on the fringe of his meeting with sharon a few days ago , " the time is not appropriate for this conference to be held , because no one trusts the new palestinian government under yasir arafat 's leadership " .
if this contradiction in stances is a cause for surprise with many , it remains less serious than the astonishment provoked by the statements made by powell last wednesday , when he referred to " the establishment of a transitional palestinian state on the hope of establishing a permanent state , which should possess an infrastructure , institutions or something resembling territory , albeit that this might not be determined in its final form . "
how can a state be transitional ?
there is nothing to clarify this . there is nothing in the history of establishing states , nor in the history of international law , that can offer an answer to this nonsense .
and what is the something that " resembles territory but is not determined in its final form " ?
of course , there is no specific answer . as far as the " transitionality " goes , its features and characteristics are completely clear , at least in the bloody series of murderous crimes perpetrated by sharon and the " transfer " of palestinians to another world !
if these contradictory statements and stances shed a great deal of obscurity on the possibilities for the anticipated american position , the contradiction becomes more interesting when the guests arrive from the middle east and meet with the american president . we heard encouraging words , giving great hopes , following the meeting between bush and prince abdallah , as was the case following the visit of hosni mubarak . but everything was turned on its head after ariel sharon 's visit . for bush not only declared , for the thousandth time , his " disappointment " with arafat and his opposition to his new government , he even went so far as to refute his own secretary of state , powell , who had spoken of an " international conference " and " palestinian state " , albeit a transitional one !
despite the fact that the translation available to date of bush 's vision for the palestinian state , recalls the story " what wonders i saw in aleppo " , the refusal comes not from the palestinians , which would be understandable , but from sharon as well , who does not want them to see the state even in their dreams . .. or in the american nightmares !
two dates , one of them fixed and the other available for renewal at any moment . they do not work in favor of publication of an acceptable and serious american plan to apply the vision of president george bush to establish a palestinian state , nor even to launch the international conference about which washington has been speaking this summer , notwithstanding all the differences about its form and content .
the first date is the mid - term elections of the american congress next november and the self - evident truths of the conditions for success in the american elections comprised therein to secure the pleasure of jewish electors and those who support israel .
there is no need to advise a careful person .
so bush , who is extremely eager for a second term , will not run the risk of not ensuring a republican majority , and has given an example of his power to please when he employed all his powers in his recent meeting with ariel sharon .
then there is another , family dimension to please . this is to ensure the position of his brother jeb in the florida governorship where the jewish bloc is decisive .
the second possible date is early israeli elections , which sharon has indicated he will call if the bush plan does not please him .
such a situation means that any communications with israel regarding the settlement are paralyzed for at least six months , during which time it will be pre - occupied with the likud and labor party elections and then the general elections .
the fact is that sharon 's intimation surpasses the conditional " if " which he has placed in relation to the plan because it will not please him if it refers to a temporary , transitional or permanent palestinian state . nor will it please him if it relies to some extent on the content of the saudi initiative . nor will any talk about an international conference in which syria participates please him , nor etc. perhaps what is most important is that it is not probable , even if he wanted , that he would say " yes " to any plan , because his likud opponent , benyamin netanyahu , dreams about pouncing upon it , just as the non - likud extreme right dreams about it .
sharon will not therefore stop attempting to sabotage or empty out any american effort to the extent that guarantees rejection by the arab side .
there is a general belief that an international conference will start soon with the minimum level of acceptable conditions to meet a first fundamental objective , keeping american interest in the region alive and constructive , thereby allowing a gradual change of position in israel and give the palestinians hope in the possibility of a settlement .
however , with the restrictions imposed by the two dates , the one fixed and the other probable , and with the contradictions we have seen in washington in recent days - such that sharon will come out of his meeting with bush very relaxed , indeed victorious , and the saudi foreign minister , saud al-faisal , will come out of the meeting also " very happy " with what he has heard - caution against the content of the anticipated bush plan and the possibility of implementing it increases .

24 hours after the end of the visit of american defense minister donald rumsfeld to pakistan , a car bomb driven by a suicide attacker exploded in front of the american consulate in karachi , killing 11 and wounding 45 others .
washington responded by closing its embassy in islamabad and all its consulates in pakistan . american president george bush announced that the perpetrators were " fanatical murderers " and insisted that they would not frighten the united states .
the attack was claimed by a group declaring itself for the first time and promising more .
karachi police commander tariq jamil stated , " it was a car bomb ... the explosion was so powerful that the car flew from one side of the road to the other . "
he added , " it appears that it was a suicide attack . "
the explosion destroyed tens of vehicles , caused a gap three meters wide in the wall of the consulate and threw rubble a distance of one kilometer .
no american was injured except for one soldier from the american naval infantry , the " marines " . five pakistani employees at the consulate suffered light injuries .
the bodies of the dead were torn to shreds , which makes it difficult to know how many there were .
however , the pakistani interior ministry said that 11 persons were killed and 45 others injured .
it added that among the victims there were four policemen , one passer - by and two unknown women .
witnesses who were and still are in a state of shock spoke about the terrifying scenes at the site of the explosion . one of them said : " i saw a body with no head on the ground and the police gathering up parts of other bodies , and the ground was covered in blood . "
parts of the " suzuki " car that was probably carrying the explosives flew in all directions and landed in the janah garden in front of the consulate . the remaining parts from the roof of the car fell in the public toilets .
a spokesman for the american embassy in islamabad reported that the consulate building had been damaged by the explosion .
a group calling itself " al-qanun " announced responsibility for the explosion .
it said in a declaration , which was handwritten in urdu and distributed to media offices in karachi : " we accept responsibility for the explosion that took place close to the american consulate today (...) america , its allies and the rulers of pakistan subject to them must prepare themselves for further attacks .
the explosion is the beginning of holy war operations by al-qanun in pakistan . "
the police commander in the region of sind , whose capital is karachi , syed kamal shah , said that the police had received a copy of the declaration , and " the al-qanun group is unknown to us .
however as professionals we must take this fax seriously and we will conduct an investigation . "
general rashid qureshi , a spokesman for the pakistani president , pervaiz musharraf , predicted that the explosion was probably planned by fanatical islamists opposed to pakistani support for the war led by the united states against terrorism .
a high level pakistani official in the police commented that the pakistani security services must penetrate terrorist networks better .
he said , " unless these groups are liquidated it will be impossible to prevent the implementation of suicide operations . as yet , the police have done nothing but react but now they must move on the offensive . "
this attack is the fourth of its kind since the beginning of the year against western targets in pakistan .
on the 8th of may a vehicle packed with explosives collided with a bus carrying french employees in the naval installations department who were working on a submarine project in pakistan , and 11 frenchmen and three pakistanis were killed .
* in houston , in the state of texas , bush announced that " fanatical murderers " were responsible for the explosion of the car bomb .
he said during a tour of a summer camp , " we shall fight against an enemy of fanatical murderers .
they are nothing more than that .
they claim that they are religious , and then they blow up muslims .
they have no respect for human life . "
he stressed , " if those people believe that they will frighten the united states , they do not understand the united states of america . "
he concluded that he shared the grief of the victims ' families .
white house spokesman ari fleischer noted , " this reminds us forcefully that our country is engaged in a war against terrorists who want to employ any means at their disposal to inflict harm on americans and others (...) he also noted the dangers faced by men and women in service abroad every day in their work . "
he was asked whether the united states believed that the fundamentalist al-qaeda organization led by osama bin ladin was responsible for the explosion . he replied , " i have not heard anything definite . "
in new delhi the indian government " severely " criticized the explosion in karachi .
foreign minister jaswant singh said , " the incident is very unfortunate and we strongly condemn it (...) i feel great pain that another attack has occurred in karachi . " this was a reference to the attack that had previously targeted the french work team .
in paris a spokesman for the french foreign ministry , francoise rifaso said , " france condemns this attack and offers its condolences . " he confirmed that france , " whose citizens had suffered an attack in the same city , was determined to combat terrorism in any place . "

official lebanese sources noted that all eyes were directed towards washington to find out the results of what was " cooked up " in respect of the international middle east peace conference , in light of the sifting of the results of consultations held by parties of the international group of four ( the united states , russia , the european union and the united nations ) by means of envoys william burns , andrea fadoufen , xavier solana and terje rod - larsen , in lebanon , syria , jordan , the palestinian self - governing areas , egypt and israel , to listen to their leaders and find out about their position on such a conference , in particular its context , location and timing .
matters will crystallize from today as far as knowing the preliminary results of the positions adopted during the coordination meeting , which was held in washington and which included burns , fadoufen and moratinos , who accompanied solana on his tour , and rod - larsen .
they explained that the meeting of these people would not be " decision - making " , but was for an exchange of information and to extract the points of agreement and difference , to determine the position of each party and to refer reports to their immediate seniors .
they noted that the initial indicators showed the existence of a difference regarding the means of handling the arab - israeli dispute and determining the mechanism appropriate for stopping violence and resuming political negotiations .
the source of this difference was the obscurity surrounding the american position and the division between president george w bush and his working team on the one hand and his secretary of state , colin powell , on the other hand , in addition to the difference between concerned arab countries and the americans , as well as the gap separating the arabs and israelis .
they stopped at the variable position shown by bush according to the officials he meets . with the israeli prime minister , ariel sharon , he is in favor of staged implementation , that is security first to control the suicide operations completely and then make the required reforms from the palestinian authority as a secondary step .
implementation steps would be decided later .
the other incident arising from bush is his lack of enthusiasm for the international conference , in that from the beginning he wanted it to be a meeting in respect of the labeling of which he differed with powell .
he then thought , after his meeting with sharon , that now was not the right time .
powell hastened to correct this , after white house spokesman ari fleischer had preceded him , and repeated the correction when he criticized the formation of the new palestinian government .
the third incident , according to the same sources , is bush 's change of mind about announcing a palestinian state , with the addition of the word " temporary " . he tried to convince saudi foreign minister prince saud al-faisal of its validity when he met with him last thursday .
they stated that bush was speaking about " a vision " for the state , which will give the palestinians a greater right and for a longer period , whereas in a " temporary " state the rights are fewer and the period shorter .
in spite of this sharon rejected even the announcement of a temporary state and threatened to call early elections .
the sources had no information on the current washington meetings . these are , in addition to the meeting of delegates , the meeting of powell with al-faisal , the palestinian minister of planning and international cooperation , nabil shaath , and numerous american meetings supervised by bush in preparation for the address he will give next week , probably on tuesday , to announce the position on the prevailing situation and ways of dealing with it .
they considered that the extremely important consultations currently taking place in washington will be a test of the ability of russia , the european union and the secretary general of the united nations to make their voice heard or whether only the that of the americans would be heard .
this will become clear in the coming meeting of the international group of four .
they expressed censure of some arab countries for their unilateral approach towards washington , believing that collective arab movement , as decided at the beirut summit on the 28th of last march , would strengthen the arab position .
it is noted that " the international group of four " has not responded to lebanon 's request for a meeting to be held with it in the name of a ministerial delegation representing the summit .
solana was informed that there was a desire to hold an international meeting at the level of foreign minister representatives because of their busy diaries .
minister of foreign affairs and emigrants mahmud hamud said that the lebanese - european partnership agreement " allows lebanon to strengthen its role as a financial and service center for the middle east and the arab world , and improves its competitive ability " .
hamud was speaking at the bistros palace about the agreement he will sign with his spanish counterpart joseph pique next monday afternoon in luxembourg on the fringe of the meeting of the council of foreign ministers of european states .
the delegation accompanying him will include : the director of political affairs , naji abi asi , director of economic affairs , masud al-maaluf , and director of the minister 's office , muhammad al-dib .
it will be joined by the ambassador in belgium , lebanon 's representative with the european union , fawzi fawwaz , and juano qizzi from the embassy in brussels .
hamud will travel to luxembourg tomorrow morning via paris , and will then travel to london on monday afternoon to join the delegation accompanying prime minister al-hariri on his official visit to britain .
the minister of foreign affairs said , " what is new in this agreement , which will replace the " preferential agreement " signed by lebanon with the common european market in 1977 , is that it is not limited to the commercial aspect as was the case . it also includes numerous topics , including social , cultural , humanitarian and technological cooperation , in addition to social issues , such as workers ' rights and illegal immigration , and general and institutional provisions , such as the establishment of various partnership councils and committees .
he enumerated the economic subjects covered by the agreement , which , by way of example but not exhaustively , include the following :
1 - liberalization of the agricultural commodities exchange .
2 - liberalization of industrial materials with some exceptions .
3 - liberalization of the services sector .
4 - liberalization of the influx of capital and aspects of financial cooperation .
it should be mentioned that the agreements concluded between the union and partner mediterranean states are very similar to that of the agreement to be signed by lebanon . it differs , however , sometimes , in some of the provisions from other agreements because the lebanese economy is essentially a free agreement based on freedom of exchange and influx of funds and capital . "
he believed , " the importance of the agreement lies in lebanon joining the communities surrounding it , as a member of the international community . "
on this basis , it should be included in the common arab market and participate in the european union and submit a request to the world trade organization so that it will not remain on the margins of economic blocs . "
he added , " the agreement includes a number of agreements : the partnership agreement , the final agreement , and there is a transitional agreement for a period of five years that will enter into effect two months after it is signed on the 17th of june 20002 for lebanon to export its products without customs duties .
europe will wait 2 - 3 years to export its products to lebanon without customs duties . "
the european union constitutes lebanon 's first commercial partner in terms of imports . lebanon exports more than a quarter of its production to the union area .
one of the aims of partnership is to establish an area for free commercial exchange between the states of the union on the one hand and the mediterranean partner states on the other .
partnership was agreed in barcelona in 1995 when lebanon began talks with the union , but this stopped in 1997 before resuming in 1998 and stopping again . they resumed in 2000 and continued without stopping until january 2002 until it was initialed on the 10th of last january in brussels .
in the same context , samir mubarak , the ambassador to spain , represented lebanon in a meeting of senior officials on european - mediterranean partnership for political and security issues , which was held on the 12th of this june , and at a meeting of the european - mediterranean committee for the barcelona process on the 13th of the month in barcelona .
a diplomatic source reported that the senior officials discussed the political and security tracts for a plan of action agreed at the conference of european union foreign minister in valencia on the 24th of last april , specifically , its implementation and the schedule allocated to it .
the senior officials also held a joint meeting with the european - mediterranean network of foreign policy institutes ( eurosco ) .
the european - mediterranean committee exchanged views on the valencia plan of action , the " road map " . discussion dealt with commercial relations between european - mediterranean partners .

yesterday in bikirki maronite patriarch cardinal mar nasrallah butrus safir received deputy butrus harb , who said , " the visit was to consult with the patriarch over political developments , including the al-matan elections , the practices that accompanied them and the atmosphere that resulted , which almost forced the country to suffocate , thereby harming the great constitutional achievement embodied in the success of the opposition candidate against that of the government .
of course , we must not forget that the country is suffering from other problems , to escape from the political interactions of these deputy elections and attempt to exploit the political victory that took place , in order to confront or move on to other victories , whether at the level of the nation as a whole , or at the level of finding solutions to the problems of the people and not just recording this victory , restricting ourselves to welcoming this victory and the reaction to it .
it is the duty of all of us , as lebanese , to find a way out of this suffocating atmosphere , which resulted from these elections . we must exploit all our strength in contributing to preventing this from being the only victory , i . e . to make lebanon the victor , that the free victors be in lebanon , the democrats in lebanon and those who adhere to their sovereignty , independence and free national decision , that this victory be transformed in the service of all lebanon . the great fear is that some may not understand and that some may try to hide the truth of this victory , meaning that they may try to portray it as a bigoted , suffocating sectarian reaction in the face of another group of lebanese , as if this group were a group from another sect .
the truth that must be said is that no opportunity must be given for any mistaken interpretation . the elections were an occasion on which the people expressed their opinion at what is taking place . it was a clear message to the government , calling it to take into account that the practices in which it engaged in the recent past were not acceptable to the people , and that the people have rejected them and given expression to them via the ballot box .
if we were to give the battle a personal characteristic we would take away from it its national and democratic value and diminish the value of the achievement realized at the national level and that of civilization .
on this basis let us say that this battle has achieved its aim and what remains is for us to hope for two things : first , that we take the country out of the suffocating atmosphere resulting from it ; and secondly , that the government , and those behind it , understand the meaning of the people 's message in the al-matan elections , and that it respond to this message in a positive way . it should not hide in its shell , pursue a reactive policy and fear the democratic message addressed by the citizens to it . the opposite is the case . it is the duty of officials in the government to realize that they are making major mistakes and that it is their duty to understand what the people want . they should take into account the contents of this message and rectify the errors so that their people can gather around the government , instead of the people believing that their victory over the government is a major victory , a victory that is worth celebrating .
of course , it is the duty of the victor not to think that this victory in itself represents the desired goal .
this victory is no more than a step on a long road and what is required of us all is that we plan in order to move forward successfully .
the success of ghubrial al-murr was a major and very important issue , a great victory . but that does not mean that the success of ghubrial al-murr means that we have achieved the national objectives for which we aim .
there is a long road along which we must pass . this victory must be exploited well so that we can pluck its fruits at the national level , transforming it from a victory that some may portray as a victory of one group over another into a victory achieved by the lebanese , all the lebanese , in restoring the democratic system , liberating the political will and building a regime that will allow citizens to feel that they , and no one else , decide what they want in lebanon . "
prime minister rafiq al-hariri responded to a question by deputy nazih mansur via the speaker of the chamber of deputies about the middle east airline plan . he noted that the steps to dismiss staff and restructure had resulted in an annual saving of about 25 million dollars and that the decision to charter three aircraft had been made on the basis of clear financial , commercial and technical studies .
the response said , " in response to the items included in the question presented by mr. nazih mansur relating to the plan of the middle east airline to develop its air fleet , deposited under number 71 / s on 24 / 04 / 2002 , we hereby clarify the following :
1 - in the matter of the middle east airline plan :
at the beginning of 1998 the board of directors of the company adopted a plan to reform the administrative and financial structure of the company based on studies conducted by a team of french experts and following a review of the studies of international consultants and .
in 2000 the lebanese government decided to seek the assistance of the international financing organization () to privatize the company and partially restructure it . the plan focuses on the importance of controlling operating costs whilst continuing to improve the level of services and maintain the excellent safety record enjoyed by the company (...)
secondly , in connection with the dismissal of employees and restructuring :
the board of directors of the company has taken all the appropriate decisions and implemented them following approval by the council of ministers in 2001 (...)
thirdly , concerning privatization of the company :
as a result of the reforms implemented , middle east airline and its subsidiaries are now in an administrative and financial position that allows them to attract investors . they have the capacity to develop in an excellent geographical location , with a new airport and an open and free economy .
as regards finding a strategic partner , the world bank international financing organization has continued its efforts in this area at a time when the international aircraft industry is experiencing a major crisis following the events of 11 september , and at a time when the world economy is experiencing a depression crisis in light of the a number of airlines being offered for sale in the middle east region . contacts conducted by the international financing organization in this regard indicate that the market conditions will not allow this option in the current year .
until this happens , the company will continue to improve its level of services , beginning with bookings , sales , at the airport and on the aircraft . it will also continue to develop its marketing apparatus , information systems and cost control , moving towards modernization of the fleet .
fourthly : in the matter of the leasing of three 200 - 330 type aircraft and the signing of the memorandum of understanding to purchase six 200 - 321 aircraft :
this decision was taken on the basis of clear financial , commercial and technical studies , which were prepared by the relevant departments at the company and were discussed by the board of directors .
the deductions that the company was able to obtain on the account of the conditions of the international aircraft industry as a result of the events of 11 september and the international economic recession were very appropriate for the time of the purchase . focus was given to not paying any direct or indirect commissions of any type .
fifthly : in connection with the financial situation of the company :
the financial situation of the company has been improving continuously since 1998 with operating losses falling by 30 million dollars to 50 million dollars , compared with 80 million dollars in 1997 .
in 2001 operating losses fell below 30 million dollars as a result of monitoring implementation of the remaining items of the reform plan . they are expected to fall to less than 15 million dollars in the 2002 budget .
the results for the first quarter of 2002 are encouraging , with the company not recording any operating losses , which means that provided bookings and tourism and travel movement continue as present the financial results for this year will be better than expected in the budget (...)."
the supreme council of the free patriots party demanded that those in power derive benefit " from the al-matan by - elections by adopting the principle of neutral government to supervise the elections and draft an election law that provides the requirements for common life " .
the supreme council of the party held its weekly meeting yesterday at its headquarters . the meeting was chaired by deputy leader robert khuri as the leader of the party , duri shamun , had traveled to paris before continuing to los angeles to take part in the workings of the " international maronite conference " .
the following statement was issued after the meeting :
" 1 - we ask those in power to derive benefit from al-matan by - elections and to confront the breaches , violations and holes in the law and its implementation , to adopt the principle of neutral government to supervise the elections , which requires that an election law be drafted to provide the requirements for life in common and consensus , which are based on effective participation founded on the guarantee of valid representation in the light of democracy , liberty and equality .
we believe that the regional conditions and the socio - economic crises must encourage all to commit to frank and serious dialogue , and avoid categorizing citizens into groups and levels , and the attempts at openness and containment on a seasonal basis .
we believe that the required dialogue must take place under the banner of firm national principles , that cannot be interpreted , translated or construed by individual efforts , and that everything that conflicts with this spirit should be classified as maneuvers that result in nothing but negative consequences and hopeless situations .
2 - we support the decision to stop cars running on gas oil in return for the provision of fair compensation for their owners , in order to lighten their suffering , provided that it covers all cars and trucks .
we point out the importance of drafting an integrated plan to protect the environment and combat all sources of pollution .
elsewhere , we are surprised how the government can mobilize its agencies to work for the success of the summer season when we see its gross inability to provide an electrical supply and put an end to the law making .
is this reality a factor contributing towards the flourishing of the tourist and summer season ?
not to mention the voices that are raised in protest at the suspicious practices of workers in the lebanon electricity organization in specific areas whilst other areas enjoy special treatment .
3 - we condemn the attempted attack on archbishop gregoire haddad and confirm that freedom of opinion is an integral principle and cannot therefore be guaranteed for the interest of one person or group and denied to others .
acknowledgement of the other is a right for which there can be no exception . the respecting of an opposing view is a sacred duty , especially in pluralist societies . we recall that the dark ages have gone never to return , and with them the inspection courts and the fatwas of death , blasphemy and oppression .
4 - we ask about the reasons set by the minister of education ali al-samah for a new round of exams for the intermediate and secondary certificates under the old curriculum , throwing out the well - known conditions for admission to such exams .
we also point out that the conditions and circumstances for the official examinations on the basis of this curriculum have been dropped after the great facilitation and numerous chances given to candidates , which has allowed the vast majority to pass when there are among their number many who fall below the minimum level required .
we believe that such action has a negative effect on the level of the official certificate , which has distinguished lebanon in its surrounding environment , and represents a grave danger for its educational level and pioneering role in the region . "
in his sermon deputy chairman of the supreme people 's islamic council sheikh abd al-amir qablan believed , " the conditions of the people are suffocating and we see nothing to reassure us and satisfy the people in the existing treatments . poverty has reached frightening levels and need sometimes is so desperate that reality is denied and confronted with unsatisfactory consequences . when this happens it will drag us into problems and disasters that we do not need .
we thus ask those concerned to meet their responsibilities and carry out what is required of them in an impartial way , by being partisan to the truth and by always standing by the people and the poor .
we are opposed to strikes and demonstrations , against any action that may have negative consequences for the country and worshippers . the regional and foreign conditions surrounding us now require us to be conscious of our actions , able to perceive the dimensions of every step we take . we must therefore be very alert and awake . the impure climate that continues to pour over us , the pressures imposed upon us from every quarter , from every political , economic and social direction , must be an incentive that drives us to greater cooperation and consensus , in order to ensure that the opportunity passes by anyone harboring evil intent towards this nation , the people of which have paid a heavy price and are still bearing the effects of the zionist terrorism , which not only affects palestinians , but lebanon , syria and all the peoples of the nation . in fact , it threatens the whole world .
in his sermon scholar muhammad hussein fadlallah said , " following agreement between officials to stop vehicles running on gas oil , the people are left to ask about the political consensus which must be followed by an economic plan to tackle the many problems . it is insufficient to say that they shouldn 't pollute the air in lebanon , above the capital to be specific , because most pollution lies in the political climate that encompasses everything and which has begun to threaten the fate of the country .
we say to officials : give back the people the rights that you previously gave them before taking them back through the new laws . this can only happen when natural alternatives are provided for them , which allow them to continue .
work for consensus in everything that serves the interest of the country , but it should not be based on taxes and everything that affects the poor and deprived classes and does not touch upon the big issues , by means of which the interests of the country in confronting the political and economic mistakes that encircle it are determined .
we support the elimination of air pollution and political and economic pollution at the same time (...)."
the elephant
for the first time after the war . . movie cameras are rolling in baghdad
baghdad
reuters -
an iraqi soldier , bleeding from a stomach wound , climbs out of the ruins of a building destroyed by the bombing in baghdad .
then he collapses due to the intensity of the pain which is clear from the expression on his face .
suddenly udai rashid shouts " cut " .
the first shot of the first post - war iraqi movie has ended . the movie is personally financed and the actors are working for free .
rashid and his crew are filming " ghair saleh " , " no good " , a movie about baghdad 's situation after the us invasion and after the toppling of former president saddam hussein 's regime .
rashid , 30 , who is directing a movie for the first time in his life , said : " i want to know what it means to confront death " .
he added in an interview with reuters at the movie set on friday " perhaps it applies to any war but it is ( the movie ) about what happened in iraq , especially baghdad .
rashid 's movie is not only the first since saddam hussein was toppled in april but is also one of the very few movies filmed in iraq since 1991 , when the united nation imposed an embargo on the country following the gulf war .
the international sanctions made it difficult to obtain unexposed film and other equipment and the movie industry fell into ruin .
before that iraq had a very active movie industry .
rashid expressed his admiration for the works of federico fellini , pier paolo pasolini and quentin tarantino . he said that " the only difference between making movies now and making them before is that there are no more taboos , political , religious or sexual .
directors were previously expected to make movies which were sympathetic to saddam hussein or avoid tackling politics and sensitive issues .
the filming location was in the center of old baghdad , near the corner of a coffee shop frequented until now by writers and intellectuals . as rashid and his cameraman were preparing the first shot at the location , an explosion echoed at the site .
the explosion , which appeared to be very close , was a strong reminder of the dangers of doing anything , including making a movie on the streets of baghdad , while the us forces are engaged in battles with the iraqi resistance .
but such explosions make rashid aware of his greatest fear . besides staying alive , he fears that the longer the fighting continues , the more the arts and culture in iraq will disappear .
rashid said that after nearly three decades of suffering under saddam 's regime , the situation of writers , photographers and other artists in the country had deteriorated .
he continued , as he pushed back long locks of hair , " i am extremely worried about the status of the arts in iraq right now . there is a lot of old thought dominating the atmosphere and nobody knows how terrible the situation is . he went on to say , " as we are trying to rebuild the country materially , we also need to rebuild iraq 's artistic heritage "
rashid considers " ghayr salih " a small element in this process of rebuilding and he is proud to be one of the first artists trying to work in the post - saddam period .
rashid hopes to finish his movie after two months . he will then take it to lebanon for development at the kodak labs who announced that they would do this for free .
if things go well , then it won 't be long before rashid 's movie is shown internationally .
he said , " my goal is to show this movie at the cannes film festival next year . i think this is what we deserve after all this " . by luke baker .

my child
azza mohamed kamal jabr
good morning , my child
what 's up with you , are you stretching or are you used to waking up to my voice ,
come on my darling , the light of my eyes ,
lay your head on my chest
let me run my fingers through your black hair ,
let me see your face which has become part of me ,
my darling , come on , get up
i make you breakfast and i will have my fill of it by seeing you and seeing your eyes embrace the hope of tomorrow .
you wake every day with the bird song
and like a sparrow you run to your school
you sing the national anthem with your friends ,
you smile , you play and you jump ,
this one asks you for help
you spring up like a solid tree ,
you take your lessons as if you were taking a gulp of life ,
you jump on your way home ,
you greet one and say good evening to another
everyone loves you , and why not , you are a bird and the prettiest bird .
an angel , you walk and you fly .
you arrive home , you eat , you study your lessons and then leave with your friends .
you play , you jump from here and there .
you don 't leave the alley until you hear your mothers ' voices .
you run towards your homes
you embrace your mothers , and you come , my dear , to tell me everything that happened to you that day .
everyone is listening and smiling , no one interrupts except your little brother who busies his tongue with questions and you don 't hold back in providing him with answers .
you put your head on your pillow . you are deep in your dreams .
i wonder what you dream of ? ? !
of a tomorrow in which you become a pilot ?
in which you become a doctor ?
what do you dream of and what does your little imagination paint for you ?
you smile in your sleep . i wonder if you see a rose ?
do you see a sun ?
and you are my sun my rose and all my life .
my little child , i see in you my tomorrow and my future , the light of my life .
you are the light of hope
with your smile i own the world .
the world rejoices with your joy .
you wake up again this morning , but it is not like every morning
because today you will be thirteen years young .
thirteen springs grow before me
i remember you today , how you used to try to pronounce things with difficulty .
how we laughed at your wrong pronunciation of some letters , and how you grew up before me , moment by moment .
you crawl , then you stand
you fall and stand again
you never tire of that
how quickly you started walking with confidence
running here and there
and your tongue never stops , now you can say everything .
you start school .
the first day you carry your bag delightedly , and run with your friends to your school .
and you come back every day bringing your smile with you , and you tell me everything that happened .
and you show me a star your teacher gave you .
i swell with the pride i have in you .
my darling , how beautiful you will be when you grow up and my happiness for you grows .
my firstborn , the first fruit , the most beautiful child .
my first joy , and my first smile .
i live for you and with you i see life as being beautiful ,
and today , especially today , i see you growing up quickly , and tomorrow you will become a man .
i see you as a man today .
you came to me this morning , you kissed my hand , and you wiped a tear from my eye , a tear that i don 't know why i shed it .
maybe because i don 't believe that you are a part of me .
i could not say goodbye this day .
how i wished for you to stay beside me , talking to me , so that i could see the future in your eyes .
but you left and time passed me by like an eternity .
the time for your return came
come on my dear , where are you ?
i made you a birthday cake with my own hands ,
what is keeping you ?
maybe because i am waiting for you ,
but here is your little brother asking about you ,
i look out of the window of the house . perhaps you will appear at the end of the street .
the first of your friends appears . i ask him about you and he does not answer .
he says to me i don 't know where he went
where did you go my dear ?
you didn 't use to going out without telling me
will i punish you ?
i will not punish you today , rather i will leave it until tomorrow .
an hour has passed and you haven 't returned .
my heart starts to worry
didn 't i tell you many times that my heart always worries about you , or do you want to know how much i love you ?
it seems that you have returned
there are voices outside but they aren 't those of you and your friends .
i go quickly outside and look for you among the gathering crowd .
where is my son ?
nobody answers .
where is he ?
they stole you from me
the hand of a merciless sniper stole you
where is my son
he is still young , he did not go to the battlefront ! ! !
but they do not distinguish between the school and the battlefront .
they stole you , they stole you and with you my soul , my life and my future
they stole my smile
they stole my firstborn and my first joy
they did not give you a chance to complete your birth day .
they did not give you a chance to paint your future and did not give me a chance to see you as a man ,
what did i do to them , with what did i fight them ?
with your smile or with your future ?
this morning went with you running , and now you come back to me in the evening , dressed in your wedding dress for paradise .
i see you still smiling as you sleep ! ! !
but i wonder what do you dream of now ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?

suddenly the light went out in my room ,
and for the first time since i have lived in this house i am sitting directly in front of the window .
pitch - black darkness fell over the place , not only on my house but also on neighboring houses ,
my eyes could not miss the only light in the district where i live .
my heart beat fast and a large tear , i don 't know how it was hiding in my eye , dropped .
i was not aware of the disaster surrounding my house ,
my eye twitched with highly unusual rapidity and i stared and watched carefully .
yes it is a settlement , only a few kilometers away from me .
so if they want to assassinate any member of my family they can do so very easily .
previously they assassinated ubai , the six - year old , while he was in his house , on his bed . they assassinated him from the same settlement near my house .
i did not cry out of fear of dying , because such a death is martyrdom . i cried for a lost land , for a stolen country , for future generations who will come and ask
where is my home ?
i looked at my little daughter , who was crying with joy when she saw the candlelight , as if the eid had arrived .
i carried her in my arms and i stood by the window . she looked into my eyes and asked ,
" mummy , why is the electricity not cut off at our neighbors ? ? "
the words failed me all of a sudden , and i was unable to think for a second . she had brought me back to reality as she shook me and repeated her question .
- my child , they aren 't neighbors , those are enemies
didn 't i tell you what the jews did to us
didn 't i tell you how they stole our land
- but why are they living next to us ?
- the lands where they live were originally ours , but they occupied them and built their homes on them and lived in them .
- did they pay for them ? ?
- an occupier does not pay for the land they settle in ( the word settlement seemed to me too big for my little daughter 's mind )
- settle in it ? ?
what does it mean to settle ? ? ?
- it is when the occupier comes to a land he does not own , takes it by force to make it his and then lives in it
- and why did you allow them to do that ?
- we did not allow them , they took it by force .
didn 't you see how they kill us
didn 't you see their tanks and their weapons ?
she fell silent , as if she did not like the talk about their power . she stared into the distance as if her little mind was searching for things much bigger than it could understand .
before that , i used to blame my father ( even though he was born after the migration )
how could you leave our land and migrate ? ?
this question always haunted me
why did you migrate ?
and today my daughter asks me
why did you leave the land for them to settle in ,
i am apprehensive of my grandson 's questions tomorrow .
i am afraid that it will rain when you are not with me .
since you have been gone , i have a rain complex .
the winter used to cover me with its coat but i did not think of the cold or boredom .
the wind used to howl behind my window , then you would whisper , hold on , here is my hair .
now i sit with the rain whipping my arms , my face and my back
who will defend me , oh traveler , like the dove between the eye and the sight
how can i erase you from the pages of my memory while you are in my heart , like an engraving in stone .
i love you , you who resides in my blood
whether you are in china or on the moon .

you wake up and open the morning newspaper .
you avoid subjects that make you choke
you get ready to laugh you head off when you come to the parliamentary page
because although the newspaper is a national newspaper that takes a line supporting the ruling party , the way parliamentary news is presented , without any comment , makes me think that there 's a secret editor who enjoys publishing pointless news about what happens there on purpose …
but i wasn 't able to laugh this time :
wheat ( fodder ) not fit for human consumption has been imported
and a representative from the food sciences institute published a report about this .
so the minister of agriculture decided to dismiss the representative from the food sciences institute attached to the ministry .
yum yum , the surprise here was not about despising idiots who eat animal fodder ( not the first time and it won 't be the last ) but the objections from parliament which didn 't come from the independents , tajammu ’ or alwafd but from – believe it or not – surour !
it seems that an official was about to end his long road to the abyss when he was promoted ( dismissed ) last year by way of a kick from above …

on caesar 's gallows ,
raise your eyes to me ,
perhaps if your eyes met death in my eyes , the internal void will smile , because you have raised your heads once .

carried by those born in the slaves ' sleeping quarters and the sea , like the desert , does not quench thirst ,
for he who says " no " drinks only from tears ,
so raise your eyes to the hanged rebel and you will end like him tomorrow .
embrace your wives , here , at the roadside , for here you will end , here tomorrow ,
for bowing is bitter
and the spider weaves its destruction above the necks of men .
embrace your wives ,
i have left my wife without saying farewell ,
and if you see my child who i left in her arms without an arm , teach him to bow ,
teach him to bow …
god did not forgive the devil his sin when he said " no " ,
and farewell to the good people , they shall inherit the earth at the end of time for they are not hanged .
teach him to bow for there is no escape .
do not dream of a happy world .
for behind every caesar that dies , there is another caesar .
and behind every rebel who dies , there is futile sadness and tears to no avail .
( third mix )
oh great caesar : i was wrong ,
… i confess .
allow me , from my gallows , to kiss your hand .
here i am , accepting the rope around my neck .
for it is your hand , your glory that forces us to worship you .
allow me to atone my wrongdoing .
i give you , after my death , my skull for you to fashion into a cup for your potent drink .
for if you do that which i wish , if they ask you about my martyred blood , and if it is seen that you granted me " existence " in order for you to strip me of " existence " , say to them , ‘ he has died … without anger towards me ’
and this cup , whose bones were his skull , bears witness to his forgiveness of me .
my killer , ‘ i have forgiven you ’ .
in the moment you became free of me , i became free of you .
but i advise you that should you wish to hang everyone , show mercy to the trees .
do not cut down their trunks to erect them as gallows .
do not cut down the trunks , for spring may come and the year may be a year of hunger .
for , in the branches , you will not smell the aroma of fruit .
and perhaps a dangerous summer will pass through our country .
across the desert in search of shade where it will only see the midday heat , sand and a hot thirst in the ribs .
oh lord of the white tombstones in the darkness ,
oh frozen caesar .
( fourth mix )
my brothers who cross the battlefield stooped , bowed at the end of the evening .
do not dream of a happy world .
for behind every caesar that dies , there is another caesar .
if you see hannibal on your way , tell him i waited for him at the gates of rome
and i waited for rome 's senators , under the arch of triumph , the conqueror of heroes , the romans ' women in bacchanalian finery .
they awaited the soldiers with their creased atlantian faces .
but hannibal 's soldiers did not come so tell him that i waited for him .
… i waited but he did not come .
and i waited , until i ended up on the ropes of death .
and in the distance , carthage burns .
carthage was the sun 's conscience .
i learned the meaning of kneeling .
with the spider above the necks of men .
and words suffocating
my brothers : carthage , the virgin , burns ,
so embrace your wives .
i left my wife without saying farewell
and if you see my child who i left in her arms without an arm , teach him to bow …
teach him to bow .
teach him to bow .

a wonderful topic i read in dr mohammad massad 's weblog .
it 's the first time i 've noticed it . i think it should be viewed .
a really deep subject .
here it is : the culture of concealment in the age of scandals 7 / 22 / 2003
our arab and muslim culture welcomes concealment .
our parents demand it
and wish it for themselves , for us and our children after us so that we are guarded
and whoever is “ guarded ” in arabic is one whose situation is not known .
concealing is hiding . .
and concealing your situation is required in this world and the hereafter
bukhari narrated that abdullah bin omar ( may god be pleased with them both ) , reported the prophet 's words ( god 's peace be upon him )
that , " he who conceals a muslim , god will conceal him on the day of judgment . "
the concept of concealment in our culture has moved from concealing a sin and wrongdoing to concealing all social or economic problems an individual may face ,
to the point of concealing all aspects of daily life , such as travel and work , on the premise of " seeking to meet your needs in silence " or " looking after your candle " , as the egyptian saying goes .
because of the absence of political freedom in our countries , the concept has also withdrawn , or rather been withdrawn , from the private and personal side to the social public side .
it has become unacceptable to speak of social ills ,
or the spread of corruption ,
or human rights violations ,
or the seizure of power .
the public and private spheres in the west have been modernized and are accompanied by state projects to separate the two spheres totally .
one of them is called the public sphere
and the other the private sphere .
the private sphere is concealed and no - one has the right to enter it without the person 's consent and permission .
as for the public sphere , this is transparent and exposed .
what you do in your home after working hours concerns only you
and discussing your beliefs is not permitted in the workplace .
this division runs parallel to another division between religion and the state ,
where religion has become limited to the private sphere and cannot be crossed over .
the state has exerted its authority over the public sphere , through legislation , organization and management .
in spite of this , the state 's power is not absolute .
it runs parallel to and intertwines with the powers of civil society , representatives of the people in legislative parliament and local councils , and an established set of principles , concepts and practices such as transparency , accountability and freedom of opinion and of the press . this is in addition to another group of institutions such as private associations , research centers , private media , whether printed , audio or visual .
all these powers have joined forces to focus bright lights
and x - rays
leaving no corner of the world alone ,
no official , however small or big , unexposed ,
making him transparent and exposed to scrutiny and accountability .
the merging of the two spheres , this imaginary boundary between the public and private , has undergone many jolts and even more negotiations ,
making it almost a mirage .
this theoretical infiltration of the private sphere took place in contemporary modern thought in the 19th and 20th centuries .
a group of thinkers declared that humans move within many spheres , all of which affect and are affected by each other .
karl marx destroyed the myth of economic man ,
thus making human daily income and expenditure part of the public sphere .
freud ended the fiction of psychological man ,
and made man 's inner self a subject of research and exploration .
the linguists led by de saussure canceled man 's centrality and replaced it with language .
michel foucault came along and placed rhetoric and its mechanisms at the center of social interaction ,
asserting the absence of individuality .
this is all theoretical .
in practice , the private streamed into the public from the first moment the separation was announced .
not a day passes without the collapse of the imaginary boundary between these two spheres being confirmed .
the british minister who took his secretary as a secret lover ,
is this a public or private matter ?
the same question can be asked about clinton 's relationship with monica ,
abut the controversy about teaching religion in schools ,
the disagreement about allowing god to be mentioned in the american national anthem ,
abou bush describing his war on iraq as a " crusade " ,
as the crusades here have a symbolism associated with religion ,
which secularism regards as part of the private sphere ,
and about the republicans under reagan exploiting the religious vote ;
in other words , exploiting religion in politics ,
or mixing the public ( politics ) with the private ( religion ) in secularism 's view ,
and in the issue of allowing the veil in schools in france ,
in other words , allowing personal religious symbols in the area of public education .
are all these public or personal issues ?
more important than these disparate incidents is the appearance of new social movements in the late sixties
which then turned into single - issue movements such as the movement focusing on women ,
sometimes called feminism to defend women 's rights .
this metamorphosed into raising women above men .
then there was the black panther movement defending the rights of blacks in america
and its attendant issues of identity ,
with the public sphere becoming saturated with issues of sexual identity ,
ethnic identity
and multiculturalism .
these socio - political changes ended the separation between public and personal issues .
both were regarded as political matters .
so now family relationships are political relationships discussed in the public sphere ,
not personal matters discussed by people behind closed doors in their homes .
as for political changes , they are microscopic changes
happening at every moment
in thousands of places which have permeated social relations .
globalization and consumerism are another imaginary veil that has been lifted between the local and the global
for capital , social relations and local cultures to seep through the barriers
in an outflow called globalization . away from naïve , spontaneous and random visualizations of this flow ,
it has become clear that it moves through barriers
guarded by such superpowers as the american pentagon and the atlantic nato .
this flow is maintained and fed by the pumps powering the citadel of massive capitalism ,
while telecommunications shrink time and place , in the term used by david harvey , an american anthropologist ,
to ensure the speed of movement and its flow .
this flow is what made the relationship between monica , who had already moved from the private to the public sphere in america , and clinton
move more widely throughout the world to become an international issue .
in this context , we need to understand that teaching the islamic religion in our schools ,
homosexuality issues ,
sexual aberrants in egypt ,
or the practice of female circumcision in our arab world
are of " global " concern ,
and that the american elections , france 's policies or german legislation on work , trade and immigration are of " local " concern !
on the other hand , the capitalist essence of this flow has turned culture itself , in the view of frederick jameson , the american marxist literary critic , into a commodity subject to the market rules of supply and demand , advertising , marketing , production and consumption .
culture here is just like the images portrayed in the media :
superficial and without depth ,
satisfying momentary desires ,
not coming together to form a clear meaning ,
populist whose measure of success is the volume of consumption .
so with all the concealment and scandal in our arab world , there is a reluctance to deal patently with general problems :
scandals about officials , their corruption and the corruption of their families , appropriation of public money , increasing poverty , deteriorating social and health issues for women and children , the number of political detainees and the conditions of their detention , publishing laws , or more exactly laws about not publishing and clamping down on freedom , the collapse of the education system , the spread of unemployment and other problems that are not spoken about ,
or which are handled with extreme " sensitivity " .
there is also total ignorance about what globalization brings about in terms of exposing these problems on an international scale
and opportunities for international continuity in supporting local reform .
on the contrary , globalization , especially in its dominant american form , is used as a pretext to conceal what is happening .
talk of reforming education , promoting democracy or calling for freedom of speech has , in the eyes of many , become an open invitation for " foreigners " to interfere in the affairs of our " beloved " countries !
on the other hand , there is an " explosion " of issues that used to be regarded as private that did not use to come out into the public sphere .
this explosion has propelled sexual issues forward , undoubtedly as a commodity ,
to turn , in the words of the polish sociologist zygmunt bauman , into " an explosion of the libido "
( sexual energy , according to the freudian term ) .
contrary to traditional scandals which was a sign of poverty concealed only by wealth ,
today 's scandals will tomorrow be a sign of openness , international cultural contact , progress and liberalism ,
but also of wealth . everyone appears to produce and consume sexual images , ideas and writings .
" memoirs of a teenager " has been watched by thousands on the cinema screen ,
" night confessions " keeps listeners awake ,
and entire pages are dedicated to the sexual problems of young people in newspapers , magazines and internet sites including islamic sites !
the framework of all this production and its usual form is that of confession .
as foucault says in history of sexuality on the issue of confession :
“ it is no longer the simple question of what the act is , i . e . the sexual act , and how it is done
but in restructuring the interior of the act
and around it , the ideas encompassing it and associated fantasies , and the images , desires , models and type of passion that drive it . "
in other words , visualizing the sexual act is no longer sufficient in itself ,
but rather what the situation creates in humans and its repercussions through memory and confession .
as for the proclaimed innocent aim of this continuous confession , it is about facing our general problems honestly ,
or not submitting to the silence of outdated conventions ,
and talking freely about reality ,
or a complete expression of one 's desires and practices in order to find open and bold interpretations ,
and so on in this vein of justifications that draw attention away from the major problems ,
confining it to " sensational " problems . maturing in this way , through the production and consumption of sexual images and writings is called a " liberal adolescence " .
this is a phase that has to be overcome and care taken to avoid becoming caught up in it .
one of the porn papers which depends on porn readers has recently seen its distribution drop because of the availability of images
and , indeed , pornographic videos on the internet .
this newspaper 's editor immediately started offering what the internet does not offer :
he dedicated an entire page to presenting problems where the protagonists suffer from sexual crises .
most of these problems are resolved in a line or two ,
but only after a detailed presentation of all the intricacies of the enthralling story .
to give the goods a shine , this editor also adds hot titles such as " i got used to him and can 't stop " or " beautiful women are chasing me " and " my resistance is weak at night " !
the editor found that sexual pictures are over and cannot be seen again and again .
as for written texts , they gain new life each time they are read ,
a life in which the hero is weak to resist at night
and the heroine usually can 't stop !
the reader has the freedom to choose the imagined partner , location and time he wants ,
situations he feels comfortable in .
god almighty forbade the " spreading of immorality " in surat al-nur .
god almighty said ,
" those who love to see immorality spread among the believers will suffer painful retribution in this life and the hereafter .
god knows and you do not know . "
( al-nur : 20 ) the spread of immorality propagates corruption .
but what is forbidden is concealing the adulterer
and , consequently , concealing adultery .
we are not asking people to bury their heads in the sand ,
however , there is a difference between the teachings of the prophet ( peace be upon him ) in " people take heed "
and sensationalizing problems and making an effort to choose steamy titles for them ,
then making them available on the market for tiny sums of money .
back to the subject of concealment .
at the end , let 's go back to where we started .
god 's prophet ( peace be upon him ) , and this time we give the full quotation ,
“ the muslim is a brother to the muslim ,
he does not oppress him nor surrender him .
he who needs his brother , god is there for his need ,
and whoever relieves the worry of a muslim , god will relieve one of his worries on the day of judgment
he who conceals a muslim , god conceals him on the day of judgment . "
as narrated by bukhari .
the concealment which the prophet 's saying ends with has preludes that lead to it
and simplify its meaning .
muslim concealment begins with political freedom .
they will not be oppressed ,
nor left in the hands of those who oppress or imprison them ,
or be stripped of their liberty and dignity , while we discuss the importance of oral sex !
muslim concealment is also through their political freedom ,
that their needs be met ,
that their daily worries are relieved ,
for poverty is a disgrace that shames the person ,
and concealing it is not the pennies of charity or the dates of giving alms .
no , it is stopping the corrupted corruptors , the thieves of nations and the sole cause of their poverty
and fighting consumerism , not feeding it .
we do not deny sexual needs ,
we do not deny their importance ,
but the danger , nay the disaster , is trading in this
and distracting people from the issues of their fate .
in other words , muslim concealment is a duty and a way of exposing the oppressors and the corrupt .
as for those enamored with liberty , liberalism and openness , we say to them , “ there is no freedom for he who is not concealed ” .
and god knows best .

darfour . the military institution in south america has internal turmoil . afghanistan , chechnya , somalia , venezuela , south and north korea , the strange change of china , saudi arabia , lebanon , the euro , iraq , the dollar , opec , globalization , the civilizations conflict , politicizing religion , trading weapons , the medication 's emperor of the world , the technology and communication companies , the overseas economic companies , palestine forever .
as wolves can disguise themselves to be sheep , sheep still follow the policy of the herd .
the leaders of satellite channels , towards a new islamic world , inquisitions , security of the state , police traps , martial law , homesick inside the homeland , and now days of socialism .
but is socialism still the solution ?
forget the briefing which affects the meaning of the question and let 's discuss its real context .
as sartre says the marxism destiny would never vanish because the reasons of its existence have not yet vanished .
although the world does precede existence , as they call it , so marxism has come in the shape of a theory which exists in circumstances similar to our world
and it grew and crystalized due to the latest developments created by many people starting with karl marx and fredric anglis to tortski and lenin and rose luxemburg and even stalin and mao .
so marxism is a theory still to be a subject for trial and crystalization .
although some people have an opinion on the collapse of the soviet union in 1981 is a defeat to the theory , that was due to the nature of the period which some described as a transitional period which had many contradictions within
i perosnally think the collapse of the soviet union came as a result of changes made at the highest levels , not the lowest ones , and the gobernment 's interest in armament and disregard to other aspects of life
and it was characterized by a state of isolation and living in a shell adopting nietzche 's principle of " the more enemies i have the stronger i become "
the real crisis lied in adopting nietzche 's theory of superman which led some to stay away from the most important pillar of the theory ; which is principle of self - criticism from within
the regime kept from inside its erosion factors , and therefore , its collapse was not strange , but the failure of the experiment doesn 't necessarily mean the failure of the theory
the theory still exists and is undergoing experimentation
this is about the principle , but the question that rises urgently is the method of application
especially we live in a world where the socialist expansion the was defeated long ago for reasons that there is no space to explain here
a time at which capitalism became the master and found many people to promote it strongly
a time , which capitalists claim , is the time for economic blocs and the decrease in the value of individuals
the time of privatisation and the foreign investor 's control over hundreds rather thousands of workers and consequenty families
in the past i used to ridicule marxist movements , especially the egyptian , for doing nothing other than exciting the crowds and fueling their anger
till that first conference was held under the banner of education and open dialogue to all socialist schools , and even those at conflict with each other , with the aim of crystallizing a vision based on struggle for our reality and the possibility of change
the conference was mainly distinguished by the attempt of egyptian socialists from the sixties and the seventies to expiate the egyptian left 's sin - which i think it 's unforgivable - of full surrender to the slogans of naser era and their full acceptance of the dissolution of the egyptian communist party and joining what was called at the time socialist union , the party that we still discuss the importance of its establishment
which allowed the regime to be dragged along with what was called at that time the socialism of state which was closer to state capitalism than socialism
and although the conference initially had the objective of education , i believe it failed to achieve its goal
that 's due to the following reasons :
first : the aim of the education process is mainly to connect the educated members of the movements with mainstream society and attempt to find a common language for dialogue between people and the movement members
which was the matter that the conference failed to acheive .
so the conference could not reach members of that movement who must carry out the expected revolution on their shoulders or rather on their backs , because of its isolation in the building of the press syndicate .
so i think a socialist conference should be held in a proletariat area and not in the elitist syndicate .
the target of the process of education should be the workers not the educated primarily .
educated people can search and reach the information at their leisure .
moreover , the crisis of the socialists of egypt does not lie within its educated people , but it lies in their failure to connect with labor in real life .
and this can only be achieved through sitting together in dialogue .
and this requires descending amongst the mainstream not demanding the mainstream to rise to the press level .
second : the symposia of the conference were mostly a kind of historic narration of the left movements in the world or the rise and aggression of capitalism or of some " left " egyptian victories which are as falling stars the ray of which will soon vanish and is always heading for extinction .
but despite that , the symposia were characterized by participation which i think were the real fruit of that conference .
some of which i would like to tackle .
one citizen of menya , who was distinguishable by his garb , a common galabeya , and a scarf bound around his neck ,
spoke in a critical tone of the conference 's neglect of peasants and their crises , although they represent six million egyptian citizens living under the line of poverty or just touching it at best .
one of the sudanese youth , who belongs to the sudanese communist party , was stunned
all he could do was ask whether this socialist labor party was a necessity ,
and he posed that question in two thousand and five ; he spoke with an attempt at holding back laughter .
third : a tone of beatitude of the kind " holier - than - thou " without anybody being able to question our superiority .
establishing a communist egyptian party or what they might call a socialist labor party is of course a necessity .
but the question should have been focused on the means of establishing this party , rather than questioning its necessity .
also , expanding the popular base to include workers , peasants and the marginalized , the educated and even employees is also a necessity , due to the nature of the times .
for we live in a time when privatization has dissolved the working class as much as it could ,
and when capitalism resorted to fragmenting the labor unions into small groups .
moreover , marginalization and uprooting and increasing pricing did not distinguish between the worker and the employee .
even police officers , the army , medical staff and engineers were not immune to imperialism .
therefore , it was important to broaden the circle of struggle to include society as a whole with all its sectors and classes , with the workers at its center .
but before talking about the revolution which everybody is applauding and heralding the approach of , to the point that you sense it 's closer to you than veins are to your blood , isn 't it our primary duty to determine what this expected revolution is all about ? ! !
shouldn 't we be determining the methods of setting it up , or shall we merely make do with its dynamic form ?
the masses are being melted in the crucible of the crisis , so they rise in anger .
do we not have a duty , instead of discussing the necessity to establish the party to discuss the method of establishing it ?
shouldn 't we . . .
questions never end , but answering them is never impossible .
moreover , all things are interconnected with an invisible thread , that being the wrathful masses .
in the past , what was known as individual rule was dominant , and that is a single leader or champion or inciter for the public .
that model has vanished ,
and i don 't think it 's going to return .
so we now live in a world truly void of charismatic personalities , around whom the masses can gather .
but what is the role of egypt 's socialists ?
looking back at the marxist tradition , we find that struggle is a group or a set of serial episodes , which cannot be separated from each other - marx , inglis , the selected words .
thus , arousing the masses is part and parcel of the process of educating them ,
is part and parcel of struggle , in all its forms , against imperialism , and the uprooting of liberties ,
and indeed it is part and parcel of the demand for a party .
these are all a group of parallel steps which must meet in the end with the popular intifada .
but despite our awareness of all these principles , we insist till the end , that the crowds merely need someone to awake them from their deep slumber .
this can only be achieved via arousing them , ignoring the other episodes .
and this is what makes most intifadas of the left always seem like a meteor , quick to be illumined , quick to be extinguished .
that led me to describe one of the demonstrations of the campaign for change as a demonstration of subway passengers .
look where the egyptian left is heading !
the process of educating the masses , which is truly the fuel for the revolution and the only thing capable of confronting the regime , is no more than a few statements of condemnation and criticism .
and if there was any educating , it should be at the highest level of the movement rather than the lowest .
this is an educating of the cadres of the movement , who mostly crack under the pressures of daily life so their role is no more than complaints and sighs .
egypt which submitted to the rule of those military regimes for over 53 years cannot change overnight .
i know that change is difficult , but that is an incentive for making the most of the opportunity
and that margin of democracy for intensifying this revolutionary work , but on sound bases , not necessarily reaping the fruits tomorrow or the next day .
but it is an attempt to melt the ice and passiveness which has become dominant in the egyptian mainstream and instill some principles .
and that won 't result in crying over spilt milk , or displaying past glories , as is now the case .
so we are still determined to usurp the only popular intifada in our time from the people and attributing it to ourselves .
we still insist on overtaking the 20th - of - march intifada , with a conviction that it was a popular intifada , which can at the very least be described as spontaneous .
we still insist that it 's the product of all efforts exerted since the palestinian intifada took place and up to the strike on iraq .
but i truly say this , that the 20th of march was a day of the people , by the people ,
which the left tried to get control of and direct , but the missing link cost it control , so it tried to bid for it .
on the 4th of april , in a move which can at the very least be described as political stupidity , check the intifada dossier " three days of the toppling of the masks of the regime "
furthermore , the educating process must focus on the masses not the cadres .
amongst every ten socialists there are nine cadres and the tenth is struggling to join them
then we reach the second question ,
which is the party
the process of establishing a party is truly essential .
but if we assume that the party committee agreed to set up that party , note that we are dealing here largely with a society studying the psychology of the egyptian people , knowing well that this is a people who are content with whatever they get ,
for on the 26th of february , the regime announced a modification of the constitution , the same regime which had announced a few days before that demanding a change in the constitution was a destructive act and not at all on the agenda in an attempt to discredit the egyptian left - and then . . . after establishing the alleged party , who will join it ?
the first mission in partisan work is finding a broad popular base , which is attempting to establish that party - cart before the horse - not establishing a party and then seeking members for it .
we need a social not a political revolution .
a revolution that would clash with all the regime 's institutions , starting with economic and political institutions all the way to cultural and social ones , right down to the smallest institutions of society , which is the egyptian family .
a revolution that would destroy all tabood and traditions , which have enslaved us for many many decades .
a revolution led by the masses not the cadres .
a revolution carrying the banner of social equality for every citizen . . .
multi - partisanship is a right that cannot be compromised .
parliament is above the regime and the people is above parliament .
a revolution that won 't take the slogan " down with mubarak " as its starting point .
for change must come from the bottom up and not at the top of the regime ladder .
bond with the masses . .
teach them how to demand their rights . . .
support their dreams . . .
find a common language between you and them ,
in order for them to support you and stand between you and the taskmasters of that regime .
struggle must not be a mere duty , we forget all about when we enter our homes and embrace our wives , satisfying our sexual desires and enjoying our final cigarette .
struggle must not be a mere step towards achieving our personal gains .
in the end , i can only commend the activities of the conference .
it is just one step on the road .
but i dream that the second conference of the research center be held in a popular proletariat and not in the headquarters of a syndicate or the lobby of a prestigious hotel .
education as a goal must reach those in need of it not those already possessing it .
i know that i have exceeded the three minutes allocated to me , but that satellite is mine , and even so i apologize for prolonging my speech , for i actually have no time for brevity .

the death of the egyptian tiger " ahmed zaki " after a long struggle with illness at the age of fifty - five ;
he is one of the few actors to be considered a son of the school of impressionism .
i think that the news item is enough and i don 't need to comment ! !
tareek - alshaab
the progressive democratic patriotic frontier
is a guarantee for a federal democratic iraq .
karim ahmed " al-tareek "
there are more meetings , these days , for the different parties and organizations in the country ,
where different words and speeches are delivered .
while the iraqi press , including newspapers , start to produce articles and political analyses ,
the writers of political articles on the internet become more active about the situation in iraq ,
the attention of some arab politicians , as well as those in the region and the world , gets drawn ,
and the united nations organization sends , through its secretary general kofi annan , its ambassador al-akhdar al-ibrahimi to iraq , in order to exchange views and opinions with the governing council , parties , organizations , and independent iraqi political figures ,
in order to agree on a resolution for transferring authority to the iraqi people on the 30th of next june . . etc .
and all these different political parties and movements deal with the situation in iraq from its own point of view through the analysis and the conclusion ,
everyone demonstrates the instability and loss of security ,
and terrorist operations which are carried out by the former dissolved regime 's bodies and former dark powers as well as some terrorist powers from outside the country ,
which wear the guise of patriotism against foreign occupation .
but , in fact , they intend to disrupt the rebuilding of the new iraq , firstly ,
and also work on reviving the sectarian dictator regime which encourages the dark bygone era .
the occupation authority is the one responsible for this dangerous and desperate situation .
because , since the day of the dictatorial regime 's collapse , the opportunity has arisen for the cells of the ousted regime to re - organize themselves ,
and carry out terrorist operations which threaten security .
and enact the rebuilding of iraq .
also , they neglected the protection of borders from the flow of foreign terrorist powers to organize themselves ,
enhance their positions in iraq ,
and clear the way before sectarian powers ,
which aim to take control through armed violence and terrorism .
moreover , the occupation authority , since the first day of occupying iraq , relied on sectarian and tribal foundations in organizing the temporary administrative affairs ,
ignoring iraqi progressive democratic patriotic powers ,
which showed their readiness to deal with realities on the ground , on the basis of :
1 - no return of the dictator regime .
2 - ending the occupation .
3 - handing the authority to iraqis and fulfilling independence and homeland sovereignty .
4 - establishing a federal democratic parliamentary governing system
and till now the following have been fulfilled :
1 - spreading liberal democratic liberties .
2 - establishing the transitionary governing council ,
despite its many shortages ,
and its failure to represent all political directions , especially political powers .
3 - legislating a temporary law which has a constitutional content for managing the transitory iraqi government .
4 - making a promise to hand power to iraqis on the 30th of june .
but occupiers usurped all powers after the collapse of all the foundations of the iraqi state .
therefore , the mission of iraqis is to build a new iraq on a federal and democratic basis .
this tough and dangerous mission does not concern only one social sector ,
nor even a mission of one political party .
rather , it is the mission of all social classes and sectors .
it is the mission of the populace , including arabs , kurds and all other races .
it is the mission of the people 's progressive , democratic , patriotic and political powers , be they arab or kurdish .
also , there is a kurdish feature which should be paid serious and responsible attention by all the kurdish political powers ,
that being defending and applying democracy , applying and practicing federalism on the level of all the kurdish province .
and this requires uniting all administrations of the province ,
and distancing ourselves from the narrow interests of the parties which take us far away from the main mission ,
that of applying and developing democracy in all walks of life , be they administrative , political , social or economical for the people in the province ,
and that of practicing federalism in the provincial scope as a system and in connection with the central iraqi government ,
as well as complying with all clauses and sections contained in the provision 's constitution and the permanent iraqi constitution .
the practice of federalism in the kurdistan province by our kurdish people and other races living within it , which must be performed through the administrative and cultural rights within this governing system , proves how important , essential , and administratively crucial it is for our people ,
as a solution to the racial issue in a country with different races like iraq .
and this democracy and federalism can be developed and deepened more and more , till it gets to the level of equality in rights with the arab people where everyone can determine and carry out his destiny .
so the uniqueness of these missions which face the kurdish patriotic liberation movement is not the responsibility of one social group or another ,
nor is it the responsibility of a specific party alone .
but it is the mission of all kurdish people of all sectors ,
and the mission of all its political parties ,
which offer themselves as a unified program for all .
therefore , consolidating this entity and developing it is the duty of all responsible political powers .
they should initiate a project to unite all kurdish parties and organizations , which represent all sectors , within a kurdish scope , according to a specific shared program and the constitution of this frontier .
and this frontier should prepare the requirements of the struggle in the elections with a joint list ,
which specifies the share of each party in this frontier , according to its power and status in the kurdish liberation movement .
also , it is necessary that the kurdish frontier should be expanded to include the social and political independent figures ,
and the elections should be based on a 1 % proportion ,
where it may be possible to see the next province 's parliament include the majority of kurdish political movements and their independent figures .
so , in this case , the whole people will take responsibility for managing the province .
and everyone will play their role in applying and deepening democracy and practicing federalism and the shared contribution in building a new iraq . the requirements of fulfilling this great mission , primarily , are :
1 - uniting the two administrations as soon as possible
and uniting all their foundations .
2 - giving up the loyalty of the party , which distances us from our main aims and escalates the struggle for petty selfish interests .
3 - working towards the removal of negative thought and political remains , resulting from the unnecessary and untimely party struggles .
reaching the establishment of a kurdish frontier and running elections with a single list of the uniting frontier will place the kurdish liberation movement at the front line to play its pioneering role in establishing a progressive , democratic and patriotic frontier in iraq .
the establishment of a frontier coalition between the progressive and democratic powers in iraq is the core mission
and any hesitation in establishing this frontier will cause a lot of damage to the issues of independence , patriotic sovereignty , democracy , and federalism .
hence , the progressive and democratic patriotic powers and the kurdish liberation movement should realize the developments of the situation in iraq since they did not unite to save their powers through establishing a democratic iraqi patriotic frontier
and entering the elections with a common progressive democratic list , which includes the arabs and kurds , in order to build a coalition of central government .
and this requires , before everything else , realizing the fact that iraq is facing a dangerous and great task ,
the mission of building a new iraq ;
the iraq of democracy and federalism ,
an iraq in which racial rights , minority rights , religious rights , denominational rights and human rights are guaranteed ;
an iraq of equality for citizens without any discrimination or differentiation ;
an iraq which flourishes economically and develops socially and industrially ,
an iraq of peace , racial brotherhood , and flourishing progressive culture .
and faced with these these missions , all patriotic efforts should unite to fulfil them .
so , anyone who wants iraq to have independence , freedom , and happiness should adapt himself towards facing these missions bravely and without hesitation and unite to establish the progressive , democratic and patriotic frontier .
and anyone who wants to work alone and follow the petty self - interest will not be able to face these difficult tasks alone ,
and would not have the real intention to fulfil them no matter what he claims .
the kurdish liberation movement , if it agrees on one provincial program , will be able to play an effective positive role in uniting the progressive and democratic iraqi patriotic powers in a large iraqi frontier ,
and , in this case , it will guarantee the mission of building a federal and democratic iraq .

iraq . . compensations for environmental damages are too high .
geneva , 21st september . reuters .
on tuesday , iraq accused kuwait and other neighboring countries of exaggerating their demands , which are actually huge , related to the environmental damages resulting from the kuwait invasion in 1990 and the gulf war that ensued .
in a statement in front of the un compensations committee , iraq called for refusing at least $ 49 billion out of $ 82 billion , the total of compansations for losses due to alleged environmental damages .
the three - day meeting that started today , tuesday , is the first occasion on which the interim iraq government , which assumed power in june from the us - led coalition , addresses the compensation committee .
the un compensations committee received demands of compensations totaling $ 350 billion for individuals , companies and governments for the damages resulting from the iraqi invasion to kuwait in august 1990 and the seven - month occupation .
among these demands are $ 82 billion to kuwait , saudi arabia , iran , jordan and syria due to the contamination of their coasts , fishing zone and deserts as a result of iraqi troops setting the oil wells ablaze and destroying other facilities .
decisions will be reached in regards to the major part of environmental compensations in december next year .
but iraq said that kuwait and other governemts exaggerated in estimating the losses in the special meetings held last week before a non - aligned committee of experts working on estimating the demands .
hadi salman , the iraqi charge d ' affaires in geneva , said to the compensations committe in a closed - door meeting , in a statement reuter got hold of , " the republic of iraq is extremely concerned about certain recent developments in the operation of the un compensations committee . "
he added , " these developments are related to the phenomenal demands put forward by kuwait and other governments to the committee of environmental damages and public health . . . "
the iraqi diplomat said that demands of $ 29 billion had been put forward for what was described as " temporary " environmental damages at a time in which programs of decontamination were being conducted .
and he described the demands as " exaggerated " .
he said that kuwait demanded another sum of $ 20 billion in addition to other sums due to the loss of production and damages for health problems that ailed workers and he remarked that there is no precedent in the international law that recognizes any of those two demands of $ 49 billion .
kuwait stressed in a speech in the meeting that it had modified its demands regarding the environmental damages after conducting survey studies and evaluations but did not mention numbers .
khalid ahmed al mudhaf , head of the kuwaiti program of gulf war compensations , said to reuters , " the issue of paying off the environmental demands is not merely a kuwaiti issue , but it is an issue of rehabilitating the region and the health of the whole region . "
the council that presides over the compensations committee and comprises 15 security council state members has agreed upon compensations reaching $ 48.5 billion so far .
18.6 billion of it has been paid off .
5 % of iraqi oil revenues were transferred to the compensations committee , based in geneva , that pays off demands four times a year , totaling $ 200 billion proven to be direct losses .
zayid al-saidi ,
this term my group and i started on our graduation project which aims at developing an automatic irrigation system
and it concludes as follows : " rain distribution in the sultanate of oman is uneven and limited , that 's why it 's a must to build irrigation systems that suit every agricultural land separately " .
this project aims at the study and implementation of an automated irrigation system without the supervision of a human being ,
using special sensors along with a smart control system and according to special weather conditions and the requirements of plants such as water , soil nature , and water availability , the irrigation process could be carried out .
the model we intend to develop is a computer - based system ,
and its homogenous components are sensors to the different variables that effect the irrigation process , and the irrigation valves ,
and we will use a card to gather data ( data acquisition card ) for supervision and control of the previous components .
in the first part of the project , and prior to the project construction , some mandatory tasks need to be finished first .
these tasks include the selection , ordering , and testing of all the necessary components to build the system .
add to that the discussion of some of the irrigation plans that suit the climate in oman .
emigration
peace and god 's mercy and blessings be upon you .
a distinct project with a good idea .
that 's the case for me at least .
i ask god to give you success ,
and i hope that you can write to us about the project from time to time .
anonymous
this is a nice and innovative idea , brother zayid ,
and we 're certainly in need of those innovative projects .
i ask god for your success and prosperity .
osama .
yesterday she visited me in a dream . . . which is very strange . . . since she has never visited me before . . . never . . . even when we were together . . . even when we separated and i spent my time obsessing over her , trying to convince her to come back . . .
even when i found out that she was with someone else . . . she never visited me in a dream .
and now , when i 've forgotten about her completely , in fact , when she came into my mind a few days ago , i shook my head with certainty and said , it 's good that we are not together anymore ,
there isn 't any common ground between us and our life would have become a continuous conflict .
i try to remember the details of the dream but i can 't quite grasp it .
all i can remember is a feeling of peace and quiet .
a hazy dream . . . everyone in it has undefined faces and bodies . . . and i was happy in it .
the title is taken from a novel by bahaa taher , " yesterday i dreamt of you "
i didn 't dream of anything yesterday . i slept like the dead , after all the work on halloween .
but i watched this movie .
i felt that the movie has made up for my dreams .
jet lag ; firstly because i love the french actor jean reno .
secondly because most of the movie is filmed inside an airport .
i spent a good deal of my life in different airports ,
i feel that airports are my second home .
it is strange , only yesterday i was talking to my friends about jean reno ;
and then , it 's normal for you canadians to like the french . don 't they hate americans like you do : ) )
the french are one side and jean reno is the other side .
as an iraqi woman i do not agree with france 's position in supporting saddam but jeah reno is a wonderful actor .
i like to see all his movies , even the silly ones .
my favorite movie of his is the professional .
however , his very stupid movie , wasabi , i enjoyed it even though it was stupid .
france supports saddam ? ? ? ?
how , i mean ? ?
you mean , since it was against the war ? ?
well , weren 't we all against the war ? ?
or because of the deals , the weapons and the osirak reactor . . . ?
actually , in the eighties saddam was armed by america , the soviet union and france . its finances came from the gulf and its troops were trained by the egyptians .
we all are equally worried about this . . , .
i mean , i do not believe the american right propaganda when they say that the french are against the war because they love saddam and hate america .
france has not caused the iraqis more harm than a country like america , for example . .
you are a bore , my brother ,
i tell you about jean reno and you tell me about weapons of mass destruction .
hmmmmm . . . let 's just stay with pleasant dreams .
mohammed
continuing with change , its times , the card and those who have courage , i will talk today :
the egyptian movement for change organized a new kind of demonstration today :
" dozens of egyptians are demonstrating in cairo against renewing the presidency of mubarak " .
the kinana website shows some photos of the demonstration and the blog of saheb al-ashjar comments on it , telling us that , " it was surrounded by the usual thousands of soldiers . "
for some time i followed three illiterate women who were trying to decipher the words they had heard were written on the yellow placards , " a fifth presidential term " ; " inheritance " .
but their ignorance did not hamper their insistence on participating from behind the barriers in this mostly silent protest . they remained even after the police chased them from one street to another . this happened at the isaaf intersection in central cairo , in front of the supreme court , the location of the highest judicial authority in egypt .
yehia megahed , for his part , relates to us in anger details of the demonstration .
" then i go to the demonstration , to see that you made the timing half an hour earlier and that you were preventing people from yelling .
so , why are you sitting here , go home !
and then , what is this demonstration that lasts for only half an hour .
well , maybe an hour .
then why did you come , you should have sent a " missed call " , and spared yourselves and others the effort .
no , and the people respected us and thought we were serious .
and they circled the place and they woke the poor police officers up early .
and all that for this metro demonstration
by allah , this is a waste
in the end , you and the police force , where are you going to hide from them .
i am suffocating , suffocating , suffocating , any dog can understand me .
what is happening
isn 't the demonstration in lady aisha enough ?
anyway , i am at home , peace be upon you , no and without peace as well .
and the rest of the usual news . . . . . . :
nawal al-saadawi nominates herself for the egyptian presidency against mubarak and mohamed fareed hasanein as well .
( enjoy this piece of propaganda against him , which appeared in the government - owned akhbar al yom )
do you feel as if you have heard his name before . . ?
yes actually , he was one of two members of parliament arrested after the demonstration against the war with iraq .
although he fared better than hamdeen sabahi , who received a considerably vicious beating ( say hi to the kindergarten for me )
and . . . . he was also the first member of parliament to submit his voluntary resignation from the egyptian people 's assembly , declaring that he gave up on a reform that is not coming .
other news ? ? ?
yes . . . . according to the al-arabi newspaper , the president said in a closed meeting . . . ,
" i will win the elections , whatever course they take . . " "
it seems that he was referring to the elections .
wanna bet ?
the picture is from the beirut indymedia site , which i reached from the mind blade site .
y . mejahd
sir , the situation is really bad . maybe i am writing to you under the influence of drugs , but believe me if i saw even a little glimmer of light , i wouldn 't have sat on the internet or learned to carry a mobile . in any case , thanks for being here .
mohammed
at the top of abbas street in cairo , you see a giant red billboard which has pictures of the winning candidates in the last elections of the al-ahli club .
and above them in the biggest possible font : al-ahli above all . . . . ( most probably they mean that their election list is the one that demonstrates the essence of the al-ahli club and rises above personal differences and whims . these personal differences and whims characterize other candidates and al-ahli is beyond such candidates ) .
and why not . . . .
jordan first , the interest of egypt is above all , and now al-ahli is above all .
but is it plausible that their campaign designer hasn 't previously heard that there are certain expressions that are unpleasant to mention , no matter how much they reflect his innermost soul and brilliant mindset . . . ?
omar al-arabi
ha ha ha , where did you hear " jordan first " from ?
i will give you , from jordan , a further slogan that has nothing to do with what you wrote : people are our most prized possession ! ! ! ! !
as you see mohammed , we are bought and sold .

go now and register yourself .
bye
lone wolf
but i am very annoyed at the manner of choosing a president .
certainly interests play a role
everyone has to seek the favor of the al-ahram advertising manager .
by the way , there is a rumor that says that al-khatib refused to nominate himself for president because he works in a position lower than hasan hamdi at al-ahram .
even the elections of football club presidents are one sided .
hamadah , you forgot to write about turning football into a religion . . .
it is true that the elections were held for the club . . . but didn 't you notice how the general atmosphere at the club is for the candidate who leans towards the religious folk .
i don 't know how football and sport in general are being turned into a religious issue .
i feel that all these issues are becoming a mess .
i read this article on islamonline . . . i wonder whether it is true ? ? ? ?
i mean , people choosing the best candidate simply because he has the biggest prayer mark on his forehead .
or because he is able and honest ?
guys can somebody explain to me ?
omar al-arabi
o ibn abdel aziz , only in one case would the people elect the able and honest candidate without looking at his piety or the lack of it : if after they elect a religious person as president , the club looses the annual league twice in a row .
almost like what happened here in turkey in the days of erbakan .
the people with islamic leanings , who elected him , realized that good administration of the state is not related to religion .
and in the next election , the secularists were elected .
and their stupidity caused an economic crisis which turkey will not escape from easily .
in the most recent elections , recep tayyip erdo ? an won even most of the secular votes , especially in istanbul because he made them happy while he was the head of the istanbul municipality . this happened regardless of the fact that he is an islamist .
now he calls himself a " conservative " in the same manner as bush
just
with you omar , i know .
by allah , i was just tearingmy hair out by myself , so i said somebody should share this with me , before i pull out all the hair i have left : )
personally , i like ethics and consider them a part of religion and there is nothing wrong with that . the issue however has become not much different from the evangelism of christian protestants in rubbish america .
bush goes on appointing in his administration people who have no clue about anything , just because they are " religious " or from the same sect .
so what is the difference then ? ? ? ? ?
alef
no please , the esteemed bush has a long history of honorable achievements , by the evidence of his resume .

i was a child that summer . . .
as i was spending my annual vacation with my family in egypt , i heard one of my relatives pointing to the tv screen and speaking to my father . since the relative and my father were both resident in kuwait , they both understood these things .
the television was showing some interview and pictures i do not recall . . . people wearing suits and traditional arab clothes . . .
" looks like you have tension there . . . "
my father shook his head in disdain .
on the 28th of may 1990 , the arab summit started its proceedings in baghdad . . . .
king fahd asked saddam hussein about relations with kuwait
he answered , " they are not agreeing on anything so far , neither on oil quotas , nor on demarcating the borders , and now they are destroying the interior for us "
in a meeting for arab foreign ministers to discuss the immigration of soviet jews to israel . . . iraq submitted a paper accusing kuwait and the united arab emirates of flooding the oil markets and causing losses to iraq . it also made accusations of oil being stolen from the rumeila field . iraq considered these actions an act of aggression against iraq .
the ministry of foreign affairs in kuwait objected to these accusations and made a counter accusation that it was in fact iraq who stole kuwaiti oil .
in july 1990 , the iraqi president saddam hussein met with the egyptian president hosni mubarak in baghdad .
and president mubarak said that saddam had vowed not to resort to a military solution . . . . .
however saddam said that he had promised to wait until the meeting between his deputy and the kuwaiti crown prince before resorting to this solution .
at the end of july , in jeddah , izzat ibrahim met with sheikh saad al-sabah . the meeting was unproductive .
the new academic year was looming .
i used to enjoy the summer holidays and utterly hated school . i also hated waking up early for school . i wished that i would not go to school that year . . .
this was the first time that i learnt the meaning of the saying , " be careful of what you wish for " . . . .
arab leaders were asleep and they were woken up at dawn on thursday the 2nd of august . . . and told of what had happened
the collective question : " is it an isolated operation on the borders ? "
did they only occupy the islands ? "
the answer , " no , they entered the city "
admiral bill owens sent a short letter to cheyney saying , " the iraqis penetrated " . . . .
the kuwaiti ruling family survived the fate that was planned for them . an emergency plan was executed , moving them to saudi arabia .
one of them who did not survive was the president of the kuwaiti olympic committee fahd al-sabah .
i woke up that thursday and my father had already left for work . . .
i turned on the television to watch the daily cartoons . . . but the television was showing horizontal colored lines . . .
" where were the cartoons ? ? ? ? "
i heard my mother talking about an invasion and war or something of that sort .
i waited a bit , then i asked my mother if i could go down to the entrance of the house where we lived and then come back up quickly . .
she allowed me to do that . . .
i hurried down and stood watching the street where we lived . it was empty of passers - by as usual .
a few stationary vehicles and a hot sun .
i was frustrated , because i expected to see a real war going on in front of me on the street .
tanks exchanging fire and soldiers facing each other in two rows , and approaching one another carrying rifles .
exactly like the plastic toy soldiers i liked to play with . . . .
i came up unhappily to my mother and told her , " there is no war downstairs . . . "
to be continued . . . .

on the first of august 1990 , i was coming back from a work camp in nubariah ( helping graduates rehabilitate land ) .
and i was waiting for the high school exam results .
initially , i did not know that there were disagreements between iraq and kuwait .
and in january 1991 , during my first year at university , i was also happy with the holiday we took at the start of the first american gulf war .
i was thrilled to watch the first televised electronic war .
i did not understand the reason behind the students ' anger then .
and i did not understand the meaning of what the left - wingers said : if they enter the region they will never leave it .
i did not understand anything about politics and strategic games .
now , i am undoubtedly more educated and informed . i am more interested in understanding the games of politics .
but i still do not understand it and your photo reinforces my confusion . so they were " good together " ? what happened ?
i haven 't spoken for a while about my favorite subject . . . ( the last writing about it is here ) and i will come back to it of course .
news : " dr. ahmed nazif , the prime minister , confirmed that gamal mubarak , the president mubarak 's son , is qualified to assume the presidency . he refused to rule out gamal mubarak as a future president of the country .
nazif said in an interview with the associated press news agency and reported on the bbc website : the fact that he is the president 's son represents a real obstacle to gamal mubarak and he has to overcome this obstacle .
he added that gamal deserves to be viewed as a gifted candidate rather than considering him just as the son of the president "
comment : darn , nothing is ever easy . . . .
news : " dr. magdi radi , the cabinet spokesperson stated that bbc radio and television misquoted some paragraphs in dr. nazif 's interview with the associated press . "
comment : ha ha ha ha . . no comment of course
news : " immediately after the eid holiday , president mubarak will make a number of review tours to the provinces in the eastern delta and in northern upper egypt . in these tours he will inaugurate a number of manufacturing and service - based projects
and hold public meetings to find out the needs of citizens and their demands in the coming period .
comment : an election tour ?
news : " president hosni mubarak sent a telegram to us president george bush congratulating him on his re - election to a second presidential term "
comment : you are first , we are next . . . or saturday first , then sunday .
news : safwat al-shareef : the one - party era is over and will never come back . dialogue is not the property of the national party .
mr. safwat al-shareef confirmed that president hosni mubarak called for a national dialogue that was agreed to by the political parties , so the dialogue is not the property of the national democratic party .
al-shareef said that the national democratic party has taken its responsibilities willingly and with conviction because it believes in multi - party politics . the party does not keep democracy for itself while excluding others .
comment : and is there anything that can be said after the declaration of mr. safwat al-shareef : he has been the information minister for a considerable number of years , the secretary general of the national democratic party , member of the party 's political bureau , member of the party 's general secretariat and shura council chairman . . . ?
happy new year . . .
the picture looks like it is by bahjouri .
what is the story behind the picture ?
when was it drawn ?
just out of curiosity ( since i am a quarter bahjouri )
in al-ahram weekly " on the occasion of the national party conference , his face was the most prominent " . . . it is also a symbol of new thoughts and young blood . . . . "

we are now used to reading newspaper reports about power failures in baghdad
and many iraqi bloggers spoke about it ( for example riverbend , ziad , khalid . . . etc ) ,
and those who also spoke about the long queues to get petrol , the difficulty of obtaining cooking gas , the telephone land line crisis , the terrible cellular phone service , and the crazy , daily explosions . . .
then . . . and shortly before eid ( on the 15 &amp; 16 january ) water was cut off in a large number of areas in baghdad .
and instead of enjoying eid , everyone was outside , carrying jerry cans instead of playing on the swings . everyone was wandering through the streets hoping to find some water .
others resorted to digging wells in their yards , hoping to find water .
the lucky ones who succeeded supplied their neighbors with water .
only yesterday , the 22nd of january , did the iraqi government announce that the water cut - off was due to an operation that hit and caused damage to the tarmia project .
finally . . . today . . on the last day of eid . . . water started to flow , for the first time in a week , into thousands of iraqi homes . engineers had succeeded in repairing the pipes that were destroyed by the fighters ' bombs .
out of all the memories of bad living conditions , living without water remains the worst .
eid greetings to the residents of baghdad .
the picture is from the angry arab website , and it shows a street in baghdad , deserted on the first day of eid al-adha .

" the egyptian organization for human rights is holding , on 15 - 17 february 2005 , the 9th intellectual forum , under the heading : " constitutional reform between acceleration and postponement " at the pyramisa hotel in dokki . participating in the forum are a group of academics , legal and rights experts , political party leaders , university professors , and some intellectuals and people involved in the political scene in egypt .
the forum aims to discuss the issues of constitutional reform as it is the cornerstone in political reform and the main gateway to reforms in any other field -
as a matter of the powers vested in the president of the republic , the issue of separating and balancing the three powers ( executive , legislative , and judicial ) , the ways to activate the legislative institution and its role in supervising the executive and calling it to account , decentralization and local government . . etc . .
and the nature of priorities in constitutional reform at present , the mechanisms of possible applications and the timeframe required .
in the light of all of the above , the forum then proposes to crystallize the different viewpoints on egypt 's attitude towards constitutional reform issues .
secondly , setting priorities and mechanisms for constitutional reform .
thirdly , recognizing the visions of all sides of the political equation , which are active and influential in the process of constitutional reform . these start with the national party and end with the egyptian center party which is still pending formation .
finally the forum intends to arrive at clear and specific recommendations regarding the general program of complete constitutional reform and the timeframe suggested for implementing it . for background information on the participants in the forum see this article . . . "
events of the first day :
" in the opening speech the deputy president of the national council for human rights and former minister of information ahmad kamal aboulmagd said : " i am of the opinion that the timing is appropriate . . . there is no need to postpone the matter . "
but he proceeded to say : " people meet ( for ) a year . . and with objectivity , courage , complete security , and by avoiding pressures from here and there a constitution is drafted to suit this period " .
other speakers warned that delaying the reform may set off political violence in egypt .
the secretary general of the arab organization for human rights , mohammed faiq , said " it is strange that all arab governments without exception are talking about reform . however they are also without exception prosecuting reformers . . and throwing them in jail . .
this is one of the reasons for the explosion and outbreak of violence . "
also , ibrahim darwish , professor of constitutional law at cairo university said " egypt is experiencing numerous crises "
the crises demand confrontation
confrontation demands change
change to close the gap between what is and what should be .
if this gap is not closed , it will become bigger day after day and then it will be the main gateway for political violence .
and always remember . . . mubarak : the calls for changing the constitution are invalid . . . any tampering with the constitution will undermine the security and stability of the homeland .

the woes of a lucky , lazy , adaptable , easily bored and spoiled generation
the best this country had brought into existence .
clever , apathetic , admirable and pitiable at the same time
all these thoughts jumped into my head when i was able , thanks to a webcam in an area no larger than 12 inches , to get to know the colors of the walls of two friends ' rooms at the same time .
one of them is yasser from taiwan .
the other a police officer who was yelling from aswan .
yasser and his wife were asking me about spanish girls in one window ,
and in the other the police officer was telling me about his immediate need for a holiday
because he could not bear the situation any more .
yasser 's room in taiwan was nice , with blue colors dominating
his wife has purely asian features ,

homeland
the place everyone knows and no one finds
it is present in the heart of every human
my homeland is not my place of birth
why do we consider the homeland to be the place where those who we know are ?
they say , " wherever you rest your head is your home "
" and wherever your heart longs for is your homeland . "
it is not the place where you feel humiliated
if you are tortured in your homeland , you won 't hate it
if it made an example for you , you won 't detest it
but in places other than your homeland ?
i wanted to go and live there .
but not everyone can make choices .
i am a guest here and so i love it .
but my homeland is there .
where i always dream of going .

dead people have come to mean nothing to me
my feelings are not moved or affected by hearing that such or such a person was killed
despite that , my belief in my humanity has not budged .
the air we breath is filled with numbers of the dead until they became mere numbers , mere statistics
i don 't know the reason for this " dead feeling towards human life " but i 've noticed that it characterizes the whole egyptian nation
the reason . . i don 't know and i am not here to discuss reasons
the condition that i call " dead feeling towards human life " has led to the routine reactions we are used to
even the demonstrations that colleagues stage at the university have become a habit that must be done .
people are killed there , therefore we must demonstrate here .
even this revolutionary reaction - although it does not convince me - has become a habit and a duty
today i read about the murder of 3 egyptians on the israeli border
who were killed by mistake . the israeli border guards thought they were saboteurs trying to plant some mines .
i don 't know what the exemplary reaction - if we could find something like that - should be by a young egyptian in response to such news .
. . . but the only comment that i found coming out of the mouths of people my age was " like we need this ! do we have to be forced into the army ? "
this was my first reaction when i heard the news . . . " i don 't want to be sent to the army "
no one cared for the egyptians who were killed
why ?
because of the " dead feeling towards human life " condition .
everyone looked in horror at " 3 years will be lost doing something useless to me and as useless as an onion to the country . "
- i wouldn 't consider it a lack of patriotism or a lack of belonging to this homeland .
what does homeland mean , anyway ?
but it is a popular reaction among a large section of the population : university youngsters .
. . . the feeling on hearing the news about those killed is the same feeling as when you hear numbers said in front of you . nothing .
the media were able to - unintentionally - kill human feelings towards the death of large numbers of people .
i think this condition was present for a while but it has blossomed lately and has become more perceptible . . . .
i finish with a sentence by stalin : the death of one man is a tragedy . the death of millions is a statistic .

spoil them before you die but don 't say " there is no use . "
run from them , let them tire .
i and you know they will get you in the end
but don 't dare say , " there is no use . "
. . . let them , after they kill you and look at your corpse on the ground , say " phew ,
this one was really hard to get . "
always say , " it 's either me or them . "
" i know they will win , but i won 't let them win easily . "
" i have to exhaust them before they kill me . "
but don 't dare say " there is no use . "
don 't dare say " there is no use . "
don 't dare say " there is no use . "
many people lost their dreams because of these words .
many people died without anyone knowing about them because of these words .
don 't you dare say it .
and don 't you dare let them win easily .

hi
it reminds me of a moroccan play i saw years ago that was characterized by the hero continually repeating the following sentence = crossings are not made like this
the hero was blaming a group of people for going through life and giving up without leaving any traces behind .

some days i wake up stiff
i believe that while i am asleep someone puts some curse on me that changes my body into a wooden plank .
i feel that my limbs are not connected , that they are getting to know each other for the first time since they were created , so the hand doesn 't know what it is doing there at the end of the arm , nor the foot why it has to face the ground , nor does the small toe understand exactly what its role is in this disjointed body
i feel that overnight i have become one of those trees that did not survive the volcanic lava .
so it petrified and time stopped for it .
i get up slowly and i walk slowly .
the hot bath fails to reconcile my four limbs with one another .
i sit on the sofa staring into nothingness for a while , trying to understand .
my memory returns . . . slowly .
other days i wake up as if i had slept on a comfortable cloud or a slow wave .
and those are usually the days whose nights start with a " good night " from you .

when i write , i am like a mother who accompanies her child to kindergarten on his first day there :
i worry about him and wonder if he will get along with the rest of the kids
are they going to be nice to him ?
or will they bully him ?
will he come back from school happy and full of confidence , looking forward to going to kindergarten the next day ?
or will he come back tearful and adamant about not finishing his schooling and deciding to run away and join gypsy tribes to dance and sing for the rest of his life ?
when i write , i am afraid . really .

forgive me , i am sorry
but i have to say , " will they be nice to him ? " and not " will they be nice to him "

it was a pleasant surprise when i found that husam fakhr al-din in his warm anthology " faces of new york " speaks about hafiz al-shirazi .
in the story " two faces in the rain " husam gets to know an old persian custom
" you bring hafiz ' poetry collection and people place their hands on it
and you say , oh hafiz , oh shirazi , give us something that will make this group happy
and then you open the tome at a random page , and you will surely find something that will make everyone present happy .
so simple . . . "
sure , hafiz al-shirazi that evening gives them an amazingly beautiful poem
i was happy to read this story because husam made me aware that my aunt 's husband did not create an old persian custom to introduce me to hafiz al-shirazi and whet my interest in his poetry .
i was visiting my aunt once and i found her husband lost in a large tome with an ornamental and glossy cover .
i have a weakness for beautiful covers
" what are you reading , uncle ahmed ? "
uncle ahmed remained engrossed in the book , but then looked up suddenly and saw me
" hello , hello !
this , my lady , is a tome of hafiz al-shirazi 's poetry
come .
put your hand on it and say
" oh hafiz , oh shirazi , give us something that will make us happy "
then open any page . "
i do as he tells me and find hafiz saying
be patient , hafiz ! you shall find the truth about this rag that you are wearing ! and you will see the girdle they uncover from beneath through deception and duplicity
i won 't lie and say i understood then what the verses meant
but the sentence , " be patient , hafiz ! " hit my consciousness hard
for at the time i was going through an unsettled time in my life and wanted as usual to do everything at once .
has this happened to you before ?
did a person say a word at some time and suddenly , it lights the world
and in its bright light you see everything in its right place
sometimes that word can be so simple , something like
" stop acting silly , rehab "
or " just write "
or " spoil yourself , don 't wait for someone to spoil you "
or " let your energies flow into their correct channels "
but when hafiz said " be patient " i became riveted in my seat and i knew " yes ! right ! be patient "
what 's up with you ?
uncle ahmed and i disputed over the meaning of the word " khurfa " because the writing was calligraphy and the diacritics not clear
so i read it as " rag " and he read it as " legend "
i explained the " rag " by its association with " you are wearing " and the " girdle " and i quoted " there 's nothing in the coat but god "
but uncle ahmed rejected my theory and stressed that i did not understand the verses , and that " legend " is a metaphor
and that mentioning " wearing " does not necessary mean he is talking about a piece of cloth .
in many situations i remember hafiz ' words to me and i become patient .
and i am now convinced that he really meant " legend "
thank you , husam !
thank you , uncle ahmed
and thank you , hafiz

the persian custom is similar to a custom practised by the shia , it is called the " asking for guidance " , but replacing hafiz ' poetry with the koran
it is a nice game , as wa7da _ masrya said
but it is definitely not reliable : )

i liked dina 's idea ,
so i decided to follow her steps .
today , i am carrying a large briefcase made of brown leather with islamic arabesques engraved on it in various shades of brown .
i bought it from the al-hamidiyeh market in damascus .
after much haggling , the seller gave me an astonishing discount on the bag , and told me as he was wrapping it up for me : " if egypt is the mother of the world , syria is it 's father ! " we laughed for a long time .
in my bag today i carry the following : a small notepad in which i will write everything and anything .
i buy one of those at the start of each year .
i record in it the sums i have spent , and calculate the things i buy and what money is owed me and what i owe .
i also keep in it a poem i love very much although it is very sad .
i write english terms in it and their translation into arabic and vice versa ,
and the things i need to do and the endless tasks ( photocopy books , talk to so - and - so , send an email to so - and - so , dry cleaning , etc . )
i record appointments , real and electronic addresses , words from songs , titles of books , names of singers and albums , sentences and phrases from films and plays , lists of things i want .
there is a page with samia 's writing and another with sara 's , and a lot of colored post - it notes .
i love those notes a lot .
i own a large collection of them in various colors and shapes , and the one closest to my heart is a heart - shaped one in florescent green .
i carry the electronic mawrid dictionary ( arabic - english - french ) , two blue pens , one red , a pencil , an orange wide - nibbed marker necessary for correction and editing ,
a wrist watch whose hands have stopped ( this watch has relocated from one bag to another through the past month while i hope to find a free half - hour during my day to take it to the watch repairman and have him put in new batteries ) .
it stopped at 5:30 ,
( i like the number 5 but i don 't know what the half means ) .
i carry paper tissues and wet ones ,
strawberry scented cocao cream ( i tell maha and samia and shihab off for nail and finger biting , but i bite my own lip a lot .
i don 't think they know this about me . )
the little g - mag magazine does not leave my bag .
i love it a lot !
an mp3 player and headphones , a very small sewing kit ,
( in case something gets torn ! )
the keys to my house on a copper key - ring with " blessing " written on one side and " safety " on the other .
my car keys on a key - ring with the babel gym doll .
( on the dress she is wearing it says " party animal " ( a party addict ) .
a small mirror and a lipstick that fits with what i am wearing today ( i don 't put lipstick on before i go to work , but i carry it on me always , just in case .
last week they asked me to make many lip - prints on a big white sheet of paper to be used in an advertisement ) .
sugerless chewing gum , headache tablets , eye drops , emollient for cuts ( i cut myself a lot on paper and book pages ) .
a perfume ( i seldom change my favorite perfume and sometimes miss it during the day ) .
my cell phone and its earphones ( which i forget every day to leave in the car )
at the bottom of the bag are my sunglasses without a case ( because , of course , i am supposed to leave them in the car ! )
a very small wallet with my work cards and my personal business cards whose design caused much debate ( some said that the design fitted me very well , " it 's just you " .
while others said it looked like an advertisement for a beauty parlor ! )
my wallet is a calm azure blue with a few delicate flowers made of rosy and light yellow threads .
i put paper money in it in different denominations . i order them in two pockets : the first carries money denominations of 5 pounds and larger ,
and the other pocket for paper change .
in the card section of the wallet i put my driver 's license , the car license and the national number ,
and my bank cards , library membership of the french cultural center ,
and a discount card i only used three times .
i put additional business and personal cards
( the aim of the small wallet was to empty the larger wallet of all the cards
but i always forget to do that .
so when i will actually empty the large wallet of the cards , i forget the small wallet in some bag ! )
i carry the business cards of my friends and relatives , a medical card from the nose , ear and throat specialist with a list of medications i am forbidden to take and on which is written : " if my temperature rises , consult a doctor immediately ,
must not participate in shooting ! "
in my wallet is also a tiny piece of material from a palestinian head scarf and a tiny paper boat that maha made for me .
a dentist 's card and photos of me , my parents and my brother .
bills and receipts .
a news clip from a newspaper about a book .
a loyalty card from diwan
that i always lose on purpose . i cannot bear to think of the presence of a paper that proves i spent 1000 pounds on books !
i know that i have spent much more in the past two years but . . . a paper proving that ? !
no ! never ! )
a small colored piece of paper on which maha wrote my name , and colored it and wrote around it " i love you , crazy -
by god , you are a crowned queen . "
and in the inside pocket of my wallet a small sticker that says " never grow up . "

all the negative aspects of arab society have their origin in the culture of absolute dictatorship that we have been brought up in .
the same applies to the false religious beliefs that which we suffer from ,
for they too are products of this decrepit culture ,
and not vice versa as some fancy : that religion is the cause of this culture
dictatorship , for example , grew up with us at home before it was imposed on us by governments ,
and we impose it on our understanding of religions .
democratic behaviour , in our understanding of upbringing , is a synonym for lack of manners .
the child in our societies is obliged to listen and obey his father 's or teacher 's orders without any attempt to discuss this order .
if he as much as tries to show a facial expression of a desire to ask ( not to object ) , he will quickly get the answer : " hey , you . . . . ! ! looks to me that you don 't like what i 'm saying , boy . so your look has to be remade ( i . e . changed ) " ! !
of course to avoid any remaking , the boy immediately apologizes and puts his tail between his legs and runs for his life ( with the wind that he produced out of fear ) .
if a phd student in our universities opens his mouth during the defense of his dissertation to object , he will obtain the natural result of not obtaining his degree until he learns manners ,
which - in the traditions of the defense board - means taping your mouth with 20 cm wide duct tape ! !
overseas , he doesn 't get it until he learns how to debate and discuss and convince the defense board of his ideas .
that 's why the highest percentage of phd holders here are the mute .
in the egyptian village , it is impolite for anyone 's buffalo to drink before the buffalo of the mayor .
and if the sheikh of the town has a son , then he is our master and the jewel in our crown , and it would be very impolite to have him fail in any free elections . .
other towns would make us so ashamed , we would be left faceless and only the backs of our necks would remain .
how can we then demand to achieve democracy by force for peoples who aren 't aware of it and don 't understand what it means ?
the american stupidity is not aware of this fact and does not understand it . it thinks that by merely sweeping away the rubbish known as our governments is enough to change these countries .
but when america sweeps our ruling rubbish , and fully cleans the floors
because we were not used or brought up in cleanliness
we will all drop rubbish on the floor again
by appointing a new mayor and buying him a new buffalo , so that it can drink from the canal before our buffalo .
if not because we are used to this , then out of the desire to challenge those oppressive americans who killed our fathers and sons along with the mayor during the sweep .
and we will never forgive them for this even if they made the floors sparkle more than crystal !
solutions are provided in the fantasies of a nuclear bomb , or a destructive earthquake registering 120 on the richter scale , that would bomb all these societies completely , including a whole generation whose customs and traditions and the notions it grew up with are just impossible to change .
then a brand new generation will grow up , a blank page ready for the writing of new notions , different from those that were annihilated by the nuclear bomb . .
the worry here is that the bomb might catch everyone and leave the mayor and his buffalo to raise the new generation .
such a scenario is of course impossible in reality ,
but despite this we see the american deeply - ingrained stupidity repeating itself , imagining the possibility of it happening and trying to actually implement it in iraq and afghanistan ,
it drops hundreds of bombs daily in an attempt to eradicate the ideas and cultures of these nations by blasting them completely and then planting and embedding new ideas which it perceives as being the best .
the impossibility of this implementation has its origins in that the culture that is to be blown up has been imposed on these countries and the mayor and his buffalo are the last to die .
and so america will have to blow up and eradicate all the natives of these countries and leave no one before it can implement its policy of change .
otherwise , the mayor and his progeny and ideas will remain in the new generations ,
because the culture of " we will sacrifice our soul and blood for your sake , mr. mayor " will remain .
the mayor is always immune to being blown up .
the infatuation of the new generations with the world of the internet and electronic media in our arab societies is a golden opportunity that will not happen again in the restructuring of the ideas and thoughts of this generation
and bringing them up on a brand new basis ,
especially as the role of the traditional media , aimed only at the mayor and his generation , is waning .
for neither does the mayor start up a pc , nor does the new generation read paper - based media ,
although the television and the satellites are a common factor between the two generations up until now .
with the increasing speed of the internet , electronic journalism will enter the visual world and filmed programs and the satellites will be knocked out because of its incredible archiving characteristics and its potential for immediate communication .
and this is something that the mayor will not be able to deal with .
then his directions , orders and culture will be buried in one place with his buffalo 's excrement .
this huge role of the electronic media , in my opinion , plays exactly the same role that the nuclear bomb plays in the fantasy scenario
and leads me to ask an important question :
who among those who currently lead the clashing ideological trends will be the first to become aware of this fact ?
the ideologue who will use this bomb faster will control the trends and culture of the new generation faster .
thank god that shaaban abdel rahim has not found his way to the internet as yet ,
otherwise we would have the new generation wearing bed and lounge room covers ,
and instead of having a mere cultural crisis we would have to add to it a crisis of pillow cases !

i am really stiffled and angry at people who just say things about the lord of creation without knowledge , and explain his running of the world as they see fit and according to their whims , be they pro - fear or pro - enticement , as if they alone have the knowledge and ability to foretell the divine will .
one tells you , this earthquake is god 's punishment for the prostitution in thailand or other such rubbish , although most of the states that were hit such as indonesia , malaysia , maldives and west oman , are muslim ,
as is somalia . in malaysia for example , if you rolled yourself a joint you would go to prison , even if you were president bush 's son .
also , among the states that were the worst hit and had victims was sri lanka , which is a poor , developing country that has nothing to do with this or that , and where there is no tourism originally .
the funniest comment i read was by one of the smarty - pants saying that the earthquake will lead to the slowing of the earth 's rotation , then its reversal , so that the sun will rise in the west , this being one of the signs of the end of the world .
i think he is intellectually related to the family of zaghloul el - najjar .
another smarty - pants alleged america 's collusion , since it knew about the tsunami three hours earlier and suppressed the information , not telling anyone .
shame on her !
another went even further , and accused america of trialing a new deadly and horrible weapon that resulted in this earthquake .
one , a little less mad than the previous person , ascribed the matter to the siphoning of petrol from earth until it was now standing over a vacuum .
i don 't doubt at all that behind this idiotism are petro - sheikhdoms chocking on their money , so that they don 't have to donate aid to their brethren in islam , under the pretext that those are the guys that fund sex tourism .
fie on them ! what a shamefully sad attitude from those full bellied people ,
unmasking them before their people and the world . israel donated and sent rescue units and aid ,
and so did france and mama america and britain ,
and then you hear their sheikhs speak brazenly of christianization , and the work of christian charity organizations .
but we are in it , and as my country folk say , " water shows a true diver " so bring forth your evidence if you are telling the truth .
the same people , when the red locusts visited us in egypt , said that was god 's punishment on the egyptian people because they watch nancy ajram and haifa and habia and any other rubbish mentioned at that time
i wish you 'd give yourself and us a break and stopped burning incense and whispering and reading shells to tell us what god wants to tell us or which message
he wants to send us , because he did not make you a facsimile machine to send his messages .
give us a break , for god 's sake , from your ridiculous explanations and see how they invented an early warning instrument to warn of an earthquake 4 hours ahead .
i wish something similar could emanate from your elbows . hasn 't zaghloul ? el - najjar
found something in the koran to make a similar instrument ? ? ? ?
this , of course , is not ridiculing god 's book , god forbid , but ridiculing what they claim it implies and is not in it : fabrications in god 's name .

the sheikh in our village died .
he climbed up to the pulpit and then said : if we support atheism , we will become worse than atheism .
this was the first ruling , and in the age of bom bom and cola , the loyal sheikh uttered the ruling . . then died .
don 't ask me how he died .
the men of authority in the village threaten against spreading rumors , and my wife is pregnant . i don 't know any stories , i only know he died . i only know he died . i only know he died .
have you brought me to a crappy poetry forum or to a funeral at the omar makram mosque ?
hey pal , tell us stuff we can understand , may god have mercy on your father .
alas ! i have been sitting here for an hour , man , and i haven 't understood a word of what you said .
get your hands off me , sergeant . what 's the deal ? i am telling you i am not a criminal that you grab me by the scruff of my neck . i am an honest citizen in a free society . the police are in the service of the people , and i am the people .
it 's not right to grab people like this by the scruff of their neck . . i am telling you , the guy up there on the podium who is reciting poetry is my friend .
i am telling you , leave my arm . you 're going to break it . i 've got dignity and i am going to leave here by myself with dignity . i said i am leaving , leaving .
sitting on the sidewalk is cleaner than listening to the senile , unbalanced talk i have been hearing in here , may you get blasted , folks .

after i have decorated the streets of our village with national songs , and invited a clown , and lead a pretty girl to climb up to the dead sheikh 's pulpit and dance wantonly to the ruler 's smile
while behind the walls all honest men are stoned , even the children of the dead sheikh . the charge ? treason to the ruler and love for the homeland
the game is over , pal . only . . find me a wooden sword and a horse that looks eternal , so that i can be a hero in my dreams , in the time of bom bom and cola .

shame on you . lowlife ! was this my hope in you , that you would let an ignorant , illiterate sergeant grab me by the scruff of my neck and kick me out of the seminar ? and you pretend to me to be a revolutionary , man ?
what did this poetic revolution of yours achieve ?
it prevented the americans from invading iraq ?
the sad thing is that america kept threatening for two years , while you guys sat and wrote poetry , and when it really invaded , you went into the mosques and started supplicating against it .
no really , aren 't you ashamed of yourself ? god only accepts the supplication of a manly believer , one that has dropped the pen , grabbed a real gun and gone with it to the front .
and can you tell me what you did when america occupied baghdad ?
you came out of the mosques again to write poetry , but this time it was bewailing the children who died under the bombs .
you will continue writing poetry until the whole country falls under occupation , and when it falls you will also write poetry , because you are good for nothing
you want to become stars on the blood of the down - trodden and the children . you 've dragged us backwards and dragged our country to defeat , you disgusting creatures .
and so that you know , i do not like this fiasco in which you are playing the leader , except the bit that says " in the time of bom bom and cola " . an uplifting bit , esepcially in this hot weather .
i have written a piece that you will like a lot . i say in it : " in the time of bom bom and cola - is it possible that i am in love with you - i am only a beginner in your love - and i am not being paid wages or commission . see what poetry is like ?
people want to forget , my friend . they want to have fun .
god have mercy on your soul , nabil cork . he was the most famous song writer in the whole industry .
he made thousands and made people very happy
i can 't forget his song in which he calls on his beloved and says : " i run to you from tanta to zifta , and i have your name hung on a label . please love me so that god may repay you , for i have become minced meat because of your love . "
really great words . god bless your soul , cork . he was a man , a real man , and a first class poet like no other . not like your funeral and the sheikh who died .
what was i saying ? here , i have given you a lift home . don 't dare invite me to your crappy seminars again .
damn such an evening , you just ruined my mood , man , may god ruin yours .
hey , before you go to sleep . . may they shroud you in a poem .
why do salesmen who deal directly with the public in egypt think the egyptian customer ( the end user ) is stupid . . . . . . ? ! !
and that the customer should stand with his arms folded and a grateful smile on his face
while the manufacturer puts his hand in the customer 's pocket to take the cost of a commodity or service which is more expensive than in neighboring and non - neighboring countries
as well as not being of the same effectiveness and quality .
is that because the egyptian customer , being good natured , is a simpleton in their eyes ?
or because he is content and happy with little and does not know the rights that he should fully demand in exchange for each pound he pays ?
and why don 't these salesmen and manufacturers value the customer who comes to them of his own accord and without duress to buy from them and increases their profits . . ?
here is an incident that happened to me and i am sure occurs to many of you
even if situations and personalities differ
i went to collect my photos from the studio where i usually have my photos taken
usually , his photos are good and the colors natural
i found the photos faint and the colors merged
and although the photos were beautiful , the colors were very bad
when i expressed my objections to the photo and said that i will not take them the way they were , the employee there tried to convince me that the photos were good and that the problem was with me
as i had refused to have a colored background when being photographed because i do not like the background color ,
and asked to be photographed without a background
when i insisted on my position , he asked me to wait for 15 minutes so that he could deal with the situation , but i refused and left on the understanding that i would come the next day to pick them up .
i came the next day to find that the photos had slightly improved
and when i debated with him , he repeated the same story that the problem lay in my insistence on being photographed without the background ! ! !
why does he insist that he is not wrong
since i don 't understand his work , he can cheat me
wouldn 't it be better if he admitted that he was wrong
and that he was not able to do any better than what he did to fix the shot because he lost the film or for any other reason ?
and that this is the best that he can do and promises me that the next time this error won 't be repeated
wouldn 't i feel empathetic and accept his apology
and say , how nice , these people know how to gain customers instead of treating me as if the mistake was mine and i am the person in the wrong who has to bear the consequences of her error
i owe and offer apologies to all my readers before they start reading the words that follow ! !
the first is for the title of my article , which i see as a bit vague , but i am sure it will survive the folk saying that " the address tells what the letter is "
i am not praising henri curiel and he is not a satellite tv star . on the contrary , i see him as a person unknown to many of the readers of this article .
and i did not say that i would talk about his life , but i placed him together with a cable tv star , one of those " revenge of god " people with very famous turbans : dr. ayman al-zawahiri .
henri curiel is known to all the historians of the egyptian communist movement , to some academics , and to a few people knowledgeable about modern egyptian history , and to very few egyptians most of whom are affiliated to the socialist communist trend
dr. ayman al-zawahiri , as i said before , is one of the famous new turban - wearers as well as being one of the jihadist authorities . . .
. . and is of course known far and wide . he is known to everyone who reads papers or watches television .
a second apology is to every person who , like me , has suffered because of the acts of this unrepentant ayman al-zawahiri and is embarrassed of him still being an " egyptian " who still holds this citizenship . it is obvious that it had lost much of its power as a result of what is being done to it and has been practiced against it for over 30 years .
30 years of staying in the swampy mud , subjugation and autocracy , etc . which we don 't have the space to mention here .
another apology i offer to every loyal and patriotic egyptian who impartially appreciates the efforts of henri curiel for his homeland , egypt . i have placed him together with this dr. ayman al-zawahiri , who has unfortunately , with his terrorist ideas which are hostile to all noble humane values , penetrated the souls of many young egyptians , and to whom i - in one way or another - belong .
yes , i apologize to every reader of these lines for the barbarity of those who ruled us at certain times and who strengthened and supported the terrorist islamist movement , and sponsored it so that it would destroy the " red movement " that they thought were their enemies .
now let me explain the situation further . . .
when i placed henri curiel together with ayman al-zawahiri i wanted to make a comparison between two egyptians .
what each of them did for egypt . .
comrade henri curiel , creator of the democratic movement for national liberation in egypt ,
an egyptian communist of jewish origin .
lived in egypt until he was exiled on the 26th august 1950 via port said , during the rule of what was called the nationalist government with a majority of wafdists .
dr. ayman al-zawahiri is a member of the jihad organization and the al-gama ' a al-islamiyya .
he is considered by the media to be the second man in the al qaeda organization , but it is said that he is the top military man ,
and is considered today to be one of the most important authorities for those affiliated to the jihadist salafist movement .
it is possible to say that a person should not be allowed to put the two together and compare them , as the first man lived in conditions totally different from those in which the other one is now living , and there is no religion and no tendency that is common to both .
we will agree with all this and try to search for that one single point that is common to them both . . . their egyptianness .
henri curiel was exiled from egypt and his egyptian citizenship revoked by an unwritten decision , despite serving egypt and the arab cause with what is mentioned in history in letters of light .
ayman al-zawahiri left egypt of his own accord to fight what he deemed to be atheism and soviet apostasy . he offered us no services for the arab cause , or even for the islam he claims to be defending .
ayman al-zawahiri still holds his egyptian citizenship until now , despite all that he and his companions have done to egypt and the egyptians .
let us try , as much as we can , to find out what henri curiel did for egypt and what ayman al-zawahiri did for egypt .
in the next part we will discuss who henri curiel was .
" when shall i meet your dad ? "
i said the sentence awaiting her reaction .
i was glad to see her blush in embarrassment and happiness .
memories took me back three years from this moment to the start of our love story .
we are still in love with each other ,
and love still flutters its wings in our hearts .
boredom hasn 't found us yet ,
and we have not allowed the problems that face us to destroy our beautiful dream , made of passion and love .
nada was the most beloved person to my heart .
i was attracted to the beauty of her soul and her integrity , to her love for life and the permanent smile on her lips .
her features made me feel calm and relaxed .
how long did we dream of that moment . . of living under the same roof .
how hard we worked towards that moment .
one whole year of hard work and continual looking ,
and i was successful in getting a job at a large company .
my father gave me a nice , simple flat , where nada and i could start our life .
i felt that god had blessed us for all the efforts we had made for this moment , and that it finally arrived after long labor .
she smiled as i gently held her hand .
she looked at me without talking .
her eyes showered me with the gentlest of love . she then withdrew her hand from mine , her cheeks red from embarrassment , and said she would wait for me at a date her father would set .
days passed quickly and the promised day arrived .
i went on the set day and nada 's father welcomed me with a friendly smile .
i went straight to the point , and of course the oft - repeated and routine conversation that happens on such occasions took place .
then he started reminding me that i am young and a recent graduate ,
and the income i make will not enable me to support a family .
despite the fact that many people make half as much and live happily on it .
he objected to the flat that i own under the pretext that it is too far from where he lives ,
and that i should buy a new flat in one of the more sophisticated suburbs .
he also objected to my means which would not permit him to achieve what he wishes for his daughter - a grand wedding in the best hotel , a honeymoon overseas , a house furnished with the most modern fashion in furniture , and the purchase of the newest electronic equipment .
he told me that , like all the young people of this generation , i am unjustly treated but that he cannot sacrifice his daughter 's future and happiness with a young guy like me at the start of his life .
i listened to him as if i was listening to a replayed arab soap opera , wasting my time after i have grown bored with it , but unfortunately this time i could not switch the television off . i had to stay attentive until the end of the episode - sorry - i meant the end of the discussion .
i defended my right , and gave him my reasons , saying that i was well off and not impoverished as he had perceived me to be .
i explained to him that happiness lies in building oneself together with the person i love , under the umbrella of the love that had joined our hearts together and which will dissolve the problems we would face .
why should i suffer the hardship of life alone without any one beside me to strengthen my resolve and be tender to me ?
why should she live lonely until someone else proposes to her ?
how long would she have to wait ?
why can 't we start our lives together ?
why do we have to kill the joy of life within us and not persevere together in the face of the troubles we will face , instead facing them each on our own , away from the person we love and whose closeness and sympathy we need ?
that life , when started together , is better than starting it after time has changed our feelings and we are aged , the flower of our youth gone with no return .
he paid no attention to my words , as if i was talking to myself .
as if my words were not meant for him . instead he started repeating that it is not his fault that he wants to see his daughter happy - as if happiness could be purchased for money - and that he was never going to forgo that .
then he listed the reasons of our unhappiness , we are young .
that the economic situation placed us all in this crisis and this problem , that the increase in unemployment and inflation were the cause of the drop in the currency value , leading to the increase in prices , including those of agricultural products , furniture and electronics - and therefore the cost of marriage .
i did not understand at all what all this talk had to do with my issue . or maybe my mind stopped thinking out of incredulity at what i was hearing .
in the end the meeting was over and there was not going to be a marriage unless i accepted his demands : a brand new house , the most sophisticated furniture , a wedding in a five star hotel , and , and , and . . .
i walked out absent - minded , with no goal .
i kept thinking that night : was i wrong in deciding to marry ?
do i have to grow old so that i can marry ?
what 's the meaning of an aimless life ?
what does it mean to carry the load without anyone to support you ?
i looked at a young man and a young woman lovingly and gently holding hands , and i started laughing hysterically .
i started laughing about the shock they were in for when they announce that they want to get married .
they don 't know that this generation is doomed not to marry because the economic situation has increased the cost of everything , including food products .
and i kept wondering if my marriage was going to affect the economy of my country ?
or was it going to affect the level of unemployment and the drop in the currency value ?
did my marriage fail because a kilogram of tomatoes reached 6 pounds ! ! because the price of a plate of beans has gone beyond what is realistic ? ! ! i resolved to publish my story everywhere .
i want to carve it in history so that maybe someone who comes after me will know what we - the youth of this generation - have suffered in terms of frustration and despair .
but i did not know that at the time i was writing my story , i had written it 530 times in two years on 334 walls , while history did not mention anything about it and without meeting anyone who had learned anything from my story .
i shall continue writing until my story is carved in history .

arab republic of egypt
sarah faiz , syria
syria has lived out the last few decades within a political regime that has worked to organize society in ways that allow it to control it and remove its right to express itself except as permitted by the limits and points of view of the established political regime ,
with this aim , the regime strove to establish social and professional organizations ruled by its policy ,
within the framework of this official policy , the arab writers ' union was established in 1969 and the syrian journalists ' union , established in 1933 , was converted into the journalists ' union in 1974 .
in both cases , it was considered that the writers ' union and the journalists ' union are two organizations limited to syrian writers and journalists .
similar to the situation with the establishment of the writers ' unions that limited its membership to members of the ruling party or " party friends " , membership of the journalists ' union was limited to baath members and " party friends " in addition to limiting the membership to workers in the official baath institutions with its connotations of the political regime keeping a stronger hold on journalists .
one of the direct " baathification " effects on the syrian writers ' and the journalists ' unions , was that dissenting writers and journalists were expelled . these were often seen as " enemies " or " agents " and in the least severe cases as " uncooperative " . this prevented the writers ' union , as much as the journalists ' union , from becoming a social organization with a national character .
however , the above effect was not the only one in the structuring of the writers and the journalists unions , as it was followed by another effect : that of handing the two unions over to an authority of bureaucratic beneficiaries of few talents and limited culture to administer the two unions .
for over 30 years , any important changes to the figureheads of that beneficiary administration were rare .
maybe the entrenchment of two particular people as the chairmen of the two unions is an example of this , if not the only example , as some of the members of the executive committee here and there have been occupying their seats for almost as long as the two presidents .
the entrenchment of the beneficiary authority at the two mentioned unions resulted in the transformation of these unions into personal farms , generating profits for the beneficiaries and their cronies , through money , travel and other benefits of power , visible and invisible , but perceptible , relationships that made them able to maintain their presence regardless of all the changes and replacements which syria and its political regime has seen in the past decades .
in the context of this long history of the beneficiary authority at the writers ' and journalists ' unions , and within the framework of its practices , creative and professional issues that pertained to the syrian writers and journalists were at the bottom of the pile of interests of the unions ' leaders . neither of them took any steps that would develop the creative or professional potential of their members .
on the contrary , the writers ' union in the light of its improved financial situation began actively publishing periodicals and books that had no artistic or creative value , and whose only effect was to waste the unions potential and to distribute bits of its funds to the beneficiaries authority and their closest bases to sell consciences and offer humble bribes at a time when life was becoming hard and the poverty of those working in the cultural field increased .
meanwhile , the journalists ' union failed throughout its life to publish even a single media pamphlet , which is a fact unexplained by the union 's lack of finances .
in the past years , calls for reform in syrian life have followed one another ,
and the foundation of these calls were the intellectuals , writers and journalists . their calls found no response in the two strong unions
and both failed to come up with any reform initiative aimed at reorganizing its internal structure or at building and restoring its relationships with its surrounding milieu and environment .
on the contrary , it doesn 't seem that such changes are likely to occur unless orders are issued by the political leadership which , even if it were to introduce some reforms , would have the writers ' and the journalists ' unions as the last steps to be taken written on remote margins .
the reality of the two unions requires the escalation of calls for real internal reforms in the two unions that will take into consideration the needs and the interests of the majority of the membership and not the interests of a minority that allows the existence of the two unions for the benefit of the political regime .
however , working towards reforming the writers ' and the journalists ' unions can not be effectual or useful without a practical example . this can be given by those writers and journalists who exist independently of the two unions , by creating an association for independent writers and journalists .
an association whose ranks will be joined by all those concerned with high creativity and professionalism without being subjected to political and administrative conditions as is the case with the writers ' and the journalists ' unions .
no doubt , the establishment of such an association will be an important event on the syrian cultural and media scenes ,
as it will not only uncover the misery under which writers , journalists and their unions exist , but also contribute to the presentation of a different picture of what it could be like through the activity of those concerned and through their own effort and initiative .

the garbage vehicles belonging to the foreign company arrive to empty the cans at around 1 am
from around 10 pm until that time , carts pulled by donkeys and driven by the former garbage collectors cruise the streets .
these carts pass by the cans of the foreign company .
they rummage in them and pick whatever can be useful , plastics , glass , cardboard , paper and other rubbish .
they pack them onto their carts and leave .
we still pay the usual monthly amount to the local garbage collector who comes day in day out to take the garbage from outside the house as we are used to .
we also pay submissively for the new garbage collection , which is added to the power bill , and which increases automatically with the increase in power use , only because we cannot do without electricity in this age !
there are also the municipality workers who used to clean the street before the advent of the foreign company .
they are still in their positions and get paid to watch the workers of the foreign company while they work !
so what has changed on the streets since the foreign company started operating ?
has egypt become a slice of europe ?
it hasn 't happened . moreover , the side streets suffer from neglect much more than before .
all that has happened is that the financial burdens have doubled and that the sidewalks are full of stinking garbage cans .
on this day every year muslims stand on top of mount arafat to perform the rites of the pilgrimage
and because this day is counted as being great by god , everyone is submissive to god , lord of the worlds , while they kneel before him bowing and supplicating to the lord for his forgiveness , pleasure , pardon and entry to heaven .
however , i see that some consider the pilgrimage to be a tourist trip or a holiday
watch with me
on my way to the namira mosque to pray the noon prayer , the crush was at its peak and i was not able to reach the mosque . however , after strenuous effort i was able to find space 600 meters from the mosque .
as soon as we finished praying , on our way back to the tents that were allocated to us , we were praising god and reciting some supplications humbly before god .
however , it seems some have a different opinion about the pilgrimage , considering it a tourist trip or a way to obtain the title " haji "
otherwise , why is this man standing here wearing the ritual clothing and around his waist is a belt with a red marlboro cigarettes packet ? ? ? ? ?
another scene from the last level of the circumambulation levels around the kaaba at the holy mosque in mecca .
we were doing the farewell circumambulation and the call to the sunset prayers was made , so we stopped circumambulating and made a line to pray the sunset prayer
and because of the huge crowds on that day , the pilgrims pushed really heavily
to the point where they pushed us and made us stop praying
to the point that i was standing on one leg with the other hanging mid - air ,
afraid to fall onto the disabled pilgrims in their wheelchairs behind me
i could not stand up straight at the same time in this horrible crush and as such i was not able to pray of course
and amidst these crowds and the voice of the imam reciting the koran in his prayers , suddenly a saudi man starts shouting at a palestinian or a syrian man , i think , because he touched his wife
even more strange was that the levantine man was in his sixties or older , which was not an excuse for the man at the receiving end of the saudi 's shouting .
he did not pay attention to our demand that he quieten down and ask god for forgiveness at least as the koran was reverberating around us and the pilgrims were praying .
the palestinian apologized to the man and said , may god forgive you .
it was as if the saudi went mad , he assailed him screaming who did he think he was to be gracious to him and if he did not shut up immediately , he was going to hang him from the post next to him in the sanctuary .
i leave you to comment on these two incidents that made my heart bleed as i was performing the obligations of the pilgrimage last year
and i wonder
is this how far some people have reached in not fearing god , inside his noble sanctuary ? ! !
by abdel wahab khedr , press editor at al-ahaly newspaper
amal , the student , called me to wish me a good holiday on the blessed eid al-adha holiday .
she lives in a village close to mine , where i spend all my holidays .
i don 't know the reason why i feel very happy when i listen to amal 's voice .
although the conversation we have nearly every year has no relation whatsoever to politics , economics or sociology .
she just makes sure i am fine , prays for my longevity and thanks god that our simple , tiny village managed to produce a journalist like me - one who understands politics , debates with important officials and criticizes the regime 's policies without fear .
this was the first time that amal surprised me this year by crying and complaining to me about what happened at the kafr ash shaykh university where she studies ,
and where , during the student union elections , she had witnessed what she had not expected .
the students congregated around a particular student saying that she was the one able to lead the student union at the faculty .
the chief of the guard , however , had a different opinion ,
so after the student won as the overwhelming choice of the students , the chief of the guard and the university professors decided to repeat the elections and falsify them .
of course one of the collaborators with the security and the guard won ! !
amal cried on the phone .
she asked : how can you trust university professors , who are supposed to be an example , after they have become allies with the security and falsified the will of the students ? ! how do you deal with the university guard who is supposed to protect the students and safeguard their rights , when it forfeits these rights ? ! how do you trust a student list that calls for the advancement of national spirit among young people , when it places all matters in the fist of the security ? ! for the first time amal spoke to me about politics and sociology and told me that she knows a teacher who graduated three years ago as one of the top university students and was appointed this year for a salary not exceeding 100 pounds , the equivalent of 2 kgs of meat !
for the first time i felt that amal was angry .
she told me that she and her colleagues are beginning to talk about politics in secret , as if they were stealing ,
because political action is banned inside the university .
amal said that all her colleagues hate the government and its president , and hate the security and the university professors ,
and that they have lost faith in the future and in life in a time when law has no place .
instead , it is being tailored for the benefit of a bunch of businessmen , bank thieves , economy saboteurs , the dogs of authority , election forgers and callers for referendums .
while the poor , crushed people are groaning and suffering from corruption , poverty , hunger and disease .
thank you amal . you have confirmed to me that public rejection of all these subversive policies is still present ,
and that egypt is all right ,
and that your tears are just a shower that will be followed by heavy rain
so i tell you : don 't wipe your tears , amal .

commenting on the letter of mr. mohammed abdel maksoud al-mouji , titled " the exaggerations of osama anwar akasha " published in the sawt al-umma newspaper , in which he objects to a scene in one of akasha 's serials where an unmarried female says she had suckled a child ,
and to which mr. mouji objects explaining that suckling cannot happen without pregnancy and childbirth ,
i say that it is not a big error and medically possible , and it happens when the hormone prolactin increases in the body ,
this usually happens as a result of taking specific medication , or becuase of a tumor in the pituitary gland . but the fluid does not look like milk and cannot be discerned expect through analysis .
men too can produce milk if they have this tumor
historically , the german traveller alexander freiherr wrote in 1859 that he saw a man suckle his son in timor !
there is also a historical painting from the 16th century by the painter galileo romano showing a man issuing milk from his breast ! so it is possible .
in the end we have to say that " there is nothing better than mother 's milk " !
by god you are great , doctor . you made me laugh and forget my worries . thanks a lot .
in short , it was a demonstration
a thousand young men and a thousand young women shouting
one of the young men asked me . . would you like to come and stand with us
i said , why not , but let me understand
he said , we want our rights
in everything . it is our country and we have a right to it .
not by force , or artillery fire or assassination
treason is not in our nature
we want a law to protect us from ourselves
protect my father , my mother and your mother
protect my son , my brother and your sister
isn 't this our right , too ?
did you see your country , what 's your name ?
can you say your opinion here ?
a thousand fears are inside you
simply , why fear
isn 't it your right to protest ?
you say you want a flat for me and my folks
i want money instead of dirt . . . i feel disgusted
medicine , treatment without them forgetting a scalpel in my stomach
or something to be finalized without routine humiliation
or a kilogram of meat without having to borrow for it
look at the dollar . . . look outside
you 'll never find it like here
here , the dollar is the friend of the powerful
or , or , or , or
if we don 't protest , then i have to become a delinquent
then . . no one will arrest me and ask me . . . why ?
you like corruption ?
ok , uncle , i am coming with you .
here , i am coming and shouting behind you
enthusiasm got me . " egypt , egypt , long live egypt " . " egypt , mother of the world "
trach ! what is this , too ?
why are you speaking about egypt ! ! !
egypt is the mother of sovereignty
oh , what a disaster . i thought she was the mother of all humans
from here or from there , that was a long time ago
behave , or get the hell out of here
one more second and i will take you far away . . . to our place
and the young men , over there ?
young men ? ! ! where are those young men ? they were here a moment ago . .
they disappeared . . or are they visiting you ?
after an hour i found myself here , in the same place , almost dead , my whole body aching
what did i do for all this ?
all this because of a demonstration for peace ? that day i learnt an absent truth
that our rights every day are in a state of collapse
and even our voices , our objections are taken away through monopoly
and that to demonstrate here is akin to suicide .
the following news was published in the al-ahram newspaper , issue 43161 , 129th year on 6 february 2005 , 27 dhul hijjah 1425 hijri .
5 million citizens from daqahliyah demand that mubarak nominates himself for a new term .
a huge welcome with flowers and a demonstration of love for the president in mansura .
mubarak gives the go - ahead for university youth week
mansura , by hassan ashour and atiyah abdul hamid
five million daqahliyah residents demanded that president mubarak nominate himself for a new presidential term amidst a demonstration of love from university youth and the joy of daqahliyah 's residents at the president 's visit
mansura 's masses received president mubarak with a huge public welcome during the trip he made yesterday lasting four hours . . .
the governorates ' inhabitants lined both sides of the road for more than 5 kilometers , carrying flags and photos of the president , and repeating welcoming and supporting slogans . the streets were decorated with victory arches and bunches of flowers .
comment : mansura itself , if there was a wedding parade going through the streets , would stop functioning .
and when there is match between mansura and ahli or zamalek , the whole city shuts down from morning to night .
five million massed together , prepared arches and flowers , the women ululating and the men shouting allah is great .
five million means all of mansura residents , children , women and men , in addition to the residents of al-mahallah , domiat , mit ghamr and people from kafr al-battikh and talkha . all of them came to beg the president to please stay and complete one more term .
shameless people ,
they don 't know that the president has had enough and wants to rest a little . they should not pressurize him more than this .
it 's not polite . . . it 's not a must .
till when , i wonder , will we continue reading and listening to this farce ? ? ?
a few days ago we read the news about the arrival of madam madeleine albright , the former american state department cinderella and holder of the spiral shins golden award ,
who had a date with the director of the son of zion center ( i feel too disgusted to mention his name )
to follow up joint plans and issues such as financing the director to participate in the presidential elections in egypt ,
and the mechanism of reform imported from uncle sam 's country
this is not the only problem . the meeting was held amidst unprecedented stringent security procedures to protect cinderella from the dupes
( i mean admirers ) ,
and to arrange an appropriately healthy environment for america 's agent in egypt , and to protect him from the " headache " caused by writers of integrity when he sells the country .
on the other hand , the security men suffered a state of hysteria and sudden fits of madness , which they have been suffering since the taba incident
that made them busy arresting sinai and al-arish residents
who have done no wrong except demand the release of their relatives who have been illegally detained .
inside the book fair , they arrested the student baho abdallah , lawyer marwa farouk and the journalist ibrahim el - sahari ,
allegedly on the charge of distributing pamphlets and books calling for the overthrow of the ruling regime ! ! !
our government works on the logic that those who poison our youth 's minds
and invite them to travel to israel to benefit from the israeli ( degenerate ) society
to sell their countries and their resistance against the zionists and the governments that fund them through silence , or export of gas and cement , or hosting them in egypt ,
whoever does that it protects and affords him all means of comfort and welfare , and sees no harm in cooperating with him .
but those who struggle against political and class corruption and against selling chimeras to the people ,
who defends his hard - working compatriots who were thrown out by our democratic government ,
whoever does that has committed a crime against the royal family .
" mubarak strives so that america permits him to have a new presidential nightmare "
mama america made the renewal of his esteemed presidency conditional upon achievements that would make him worthy of another term on the throne ,
such as normalizing relations with the zionists in kuwayz ,
or the failed dialogue between the national party and the opposition which was basically assent and not dissent , except for the nasserite party ,
and even then other movements , such as enough and the egyptian movement for change , were absent from the dialogue because , of course , they were not to the liking of that party .
and like hosting the murderer sharon a few days ago , so that he could desecrate the land , to - as is alleged - agree about the palestinian people who are engaged in struggle .
papa mubarak hosted this massacring terrorist without taking his people 's feelings into consideration at all .
anybody 's else opinion is not important , what is important is that the throne does not leave the royal family .
frankly , folks , the guy is working hard and deserves another go on the throne .
it doesn 't matter that his people are fed up with him and the stench of corruption that all egyptian residents have become addicted to .
" the usual and simultaneously ridiculous security stupidity "
on friday 4 / 2 / 2005 i participated in a demonstration inside the book fair ,
and although i was not in the front ranks with those who have uncovered the facts of mubarak 's rotten system ,
i still benefited to an unexpected extent , for i followed fully the detachments and units of the 4th field force which were mobilized by the ministry of interior to get rid of the demonstrators .
we were about 20 individuals who were besieged within a circular wall made up of 40 privates from the central buffalo , together with 13 officers and file - officers , and about 35 laughable soldiers who had come especially for this battle , and three cars around us for reinforcements if necessary .
can you imagine with me the extent of the stupidity that our government and its security organs are blessed with ?
what do you think was the reaction of 20 individuals shouting out the shameful facts of mubarak 's regime ?
they were not carrying any germ weapons or chemical bombs , not even anthrax letters , to be besieged by a whole army .
and although some of the fair visitors tried to join them , standing ( just standing ) near this military zone was forbidden ,
because it was booby trapped with the revolution that will one day blow away this corrupt , muscular regime that sponsors thugs while chatting non - stop about freedom and democracy .
where is that democracy , in view of the three armed vehicles standing in front of each gate to the fair to restrain the demonstrators ?
my message to those is that " the winds of change will come soon and blow you away , so wait for them to annihilate you , for they are definitely coming " .

i read in the al-wafd newspaper that the prime minister announced to the consultative assembly that prices in egypt are lower than in many countries of the world .
as evidence , he said , one liter of gas in egypt is sold for a pound while its price abroad is 10 pounds .
and although i doubt that the prime minister said something like this , let 's suppose that he did , i would like to explain the following to him :
the average wage in switzerland is 5000 francs and the price per liter of 98 octane petrol there is 1.4 francs . the average wage in the eu is 2000 euro per month and the price of 95 octane gas is 1.01 euro per liter and for 98 octane gas , it is 1.18 euro per liter .
what we call 90 and 92 basically does not exist , in addition to the generally noticeable low quality of the 90 gas currently used .
this means that a liter of gas equals 0.00028 of a swiss person 's income and 0.0005 of a european person 's income .
take into consideration that europe imports oil and gas while egypt is supposed to generate and export it .
a liter of 95 petrol ( to keep the comparison correct ) costs 1.75 piastres , that is it equals 0.0035 of an egyptian person 's income .
in this case , the price of petrol in egypt is 35 times higher than that in europe .
and 50 times higher than in switzerland .
who is more expensive then , mr. prime minister ?
comparisons are made in the prices of the commodities as compared to average wages
and if we go into the comparisons issue , can we compare health care in egypt with overseas , the cleanliness of the streets or the ease of owning your accommodation through an installment plan with low interest rates over 20 years , or the ease of owning a car
not to mention the price of meat , both red and white , in comparison to wages are considered ten times cheaper than egypt , since a kilogram of excellent grade meat does not exceed 4 euros .
and a 1.5 kg chicken is sold for 1.5 euro
the gate to making comparisons is open but i doubt it would be in the government 's interest .
sami imran
note : the price of a tonne of dutch boneless meat does not exceed 2800 dollars , that is 16.24 pounds per kilogram .
and it could be less if you buy a whole butchered animal ( with dollars at the bank exchange rate )
i take responsibility for what i say .
last week a cute announcement posted on the university notice board caught my eye as i crossed the street parallel to cairo university . it announced a seminar entitled " scientific miracles in the sunnah of the prophet " by dr. zaghloul el - naggar , sponsored by the dean of the university and mr. mohammed kamal , dean of the faculty of engineering .
at the same time , many might not know that the department of architecture at the faculty of engineering , cairo university had seen one of the most important lectures on the trends in modern architecture , presented by dr. charles jenkins , who came to cairo on a special invitation to deliver this lecture .
for those who don 't know , dr. charles is a very important theoretician and architect who was the first to theorize postmodernism in 20th century architecture .
the man 's visit to egypt or to any university is a rare and important event in architecture , but the university 's administration which sponsored and proudly announced the forum of haji bahloul , did not bother itself with even a tiny announcement about dr. jenkins ' arrival or his lecture . despite that , the hall in which he held his lecture was so full that i had to listen to half of the lecture standing .
frankly , and despite the fact that i am opposed to the quackery and the fortunetelling of the future practiced by haji zaghloul , at the same time i have always been telling myself that the guy " is free " and console myself with phrases such as " freedom of opinion and freedom of quackery "
the guy , god protect him , has started to talk about everything from the beginnings of relativism up to the dissection of the fly , ruining science and logic .
i told myself " idiots make a living out of the mad ones " .
then he took a turn into politics , and showed up on the " it 's your home " program with mahmoud saad , saying that god has punished the muslims in the aceh region with the flood and the earthquake because they want to separate from indonesia , as if zaghloul el - naggar 's god was an employee of the united nations and engages in politics .
i said " none of my business , everyone is free . "
but when cairo university and those in charge of cairo university - which is supposed to be one of the oldest academic institutions that protects egyptian thought and mind - sponsor this kind of quackery , then frankly there is more than one question to be asked .
as far as i know , cairo university does not have faculties of theology or religion , so on what basis was the invitation issued to haji zaghloul to give lectures on the miracles of the sunnah ? it seems that he has finished with the miracles in the koran , then moved to the sunnah and then will go on to those in the history of the prophet 's companions and afterwards maybe to the miracles in haji zaghloul himself .
an invitation by cairo university is equivalent to recognition from one of the oldest egyptian intellectual institutions , giving legitimacy and logic to what captain zaghloul is saying , as if the university acceded to his talk about god 's punishment of the southeast asian muslims , and his talk about the slackening of the muscles of the butchered animal on cue when one says " there is no god but god and mohammed is his prophet " prior to slaughter ! ! and about the good - for - nothing western professors and doctors who believed , my son , when they witnessed haji bahloul 's sleigh of hand acts . .
i am not in a position to count and recount haj zaghloul 's magic games , but this is a sign that the university is deteriorating with time .
after it lost its developmental role and internal freedom at the hands of the late sadat , it is now deteriorating even more , to lose its international standing and is transforming into a megaphone promoting myths and quackery ,
as if to make the circle even more complete around the young egyptian citizen , with poverty besieging him already and now the university working on the reproduction of ignorance in new and different ways , so that the black triangle falls in place around the egyptian mind ( poverty - ignorance - and soon disease ) .

if it wasn 't for your use of the words " haji " and " captain " i might have respected what you have said , but it seems to me that you are not respectable yourself , doesn 't it ?

you don 't seem to like anyone among the brothers , and i don 't know why
for your information , i don 't belong to the brothers , but the brothers are better than the communists and the secularists , and if you don 't know their detractions i advise you to find out .
i forgive you for your ignorance .

people like you seem to have become addicted to being told off , but i won 't grant you the talk - down you wish for , as i would be too disgusted to tell someone like you off .
the only good thing you have is your name , so kindly change your name to get the dose of talk - down that you have become used to . may i suggest a few names : shalom , shamir and sharon , azer .

these words show your great ignorance in matters of religion and the world
this is the first time i open this page of your magazine and it will be the last , because this article indicates ignorance and lack of credibility .

greetings
such words should not be said about a respectable scholar in the field of geology and earth sciences , and the head of the markfield institute
if your criticism was on scientific grounds , or at a level of sophistication and respectability , i would have debated with you calmly . but your style of criticism is disgusting . . . . . .

summer 2004
i was walking along the wall of the egyptian central bank , contemplating the lofty height of the building and the beauty of its architecture , when my eyes fell on one of the basement window arches under which was stretched out a boy of about ten .
he was in a deep sleep despite the din of traffic and pedestrians on the downtown streets .
his body was covered by a piece of cardboard , perhaps to guard against the burning rays of the sun .
his brown limbs , unkempt hair and shabby , threadbare clothes were visible from under the cardboard .
winter 2003
it was a cairo night , just before midnight ; i was wrapped up in my thick coat against the cold of the night .
on my way back home i passed by the newspaper seller to buy the next morning 's papers .
a few steps away was one of heliopolis ' metro stations .
as i approached the metro station waiting area , i noticed a body lying on one of the benches for waiting passengers , wrapped up in a tattered , dark colored overcoat , black or dark blue , like the clothes of soldiers in the army .
his body was huddled up in the coat and it didn 't appear that the boy even noticed me passing him by .
he too was deep in sleep .
summer 2004
i saw her whenever i came out of the dokki street metro station on my way to work .
at first i did not notice her features in detail .
all that caught my eye was her long , dusty , unkempt hair , her tattered clothes and her brown skin .
going by that place regularly , i noticed that this woman was always there ,
stretched out on a piece of cardboard and wrapped up in a thin , faded overcoat .
it seemed that she was using it to hide herself from people 's eyes , not to protect her body from the weather .
each time i passed her she was in a different pose .
i would find her sitting , eating food from a tin or plastic bag in front of her ,
or leaning on the wall of the building or the ventilator from the metro in deep meditation .
once i found her lying down and stretched out on the pavement in deep sleep .
once i found her sitting cross - legged on a piece of cardboard , watching the passers - by and the movements on the road .
i saw her in many different postures , until it seemed to me that i was passing by - as i was passing by - the hall or bedroom of her house and not a public street and pavement .
i did not notice her beautiful features until one day i saw her and she had cut her hair in the same way as men , revealing the features of her femininity more clearly .
her skin was a pure brown despite the dust of the street , and her eyes were wide despite the clear sense of helplessness and distraction in her glances .
she had a wonderful familiarity with all around her .
from the shops and nearby newspaper sellers to passers - by all of whom i felt knew her , and even the traffic police standing a few steps away at the corner of the nearby junction .
winter 2002
it was a pitch black night in cairo . i was returning from a visit to a friend who lives near my own place .
the side streets of heliopolis seem desolate and frightening .
gusts as cold as ice filled the air around me .
at the corner of one of the streets before i arrived at the main street , i came upon one of those big garbage bins left in the street to collect the trash of the residents of each street before the garbage collection companies ' employees empty them .
i heard a scratching , digging sound from the direction of the bin .
i thought that it was a cat playing in the bin , looking for food .
when i came closer and could see in the dark , i found a woman in her forties , i guess , and a girl of maybe five or six with her .
they had taken some bags out of the bin and begun to shake out their contents before putting what they had chosen in a separate bag .
as i was walking past them i saw the woman pick up some dry loaves of bread and put them in the big bag .
this image reminded me of something i saw once when walking below one of the bridges in zamalek .
some garbage bins were beneath the bridge .
a boy was sitting with his head bowed next to the rubbish bin , a cigarette lit in his hand , and the smoke of burning tobacco emerging from between his lips .
i walked past him and noticed that he did not even raise his eyes in my direction . it was as if no one had walked by .
a number of different dates .
my eyes began to notice this phenomenon on the streets downtown and in classier neighborhoods .
on the pavements and at traffic lights , small children , youths , men and women , the elderly of both sexes , one of them was so elderly that it almost broke your heart to see him walking between the cars at the red traffic lights selling kleenex or some cheap chinese product .
it doesn 't matter if it 's hot or cold , summer or winter , mild or whatever , they are always there on the open streets .
there are those who sit on a box on the pavement , in front of them a small table on which there are kleenex , sweets and chocolate ;
and there are those who sit on the pavement at the traffic lights , waiting for the moment when the lights turn red and the cars stop so that they can go out between the cars and knock on the glass of the closed windows with worn - out fingers even when the lights have changed to green and the cars have begun to move off , leaving him jumping and weaving like an acrobat - be he young or old - until he finds his way to the pavement between the cars .
one day i was sitting next to my friend in his car .
before moving off at the traffic lights he noticed the sudden silence and sensed the sorrow which had come over me and asked me the reason .
i said to him :
them .
my friend replied ,
yes , their situation is difficult and tough , but there is nothing dishonorable about work . this is life .
i replied ,
it is not the harshness of their lives or the difficulty of their situation that saddens me , even though it has reached a level that would wound the humanity of any person .
the greatest source of sorrow and distress is the look in their eyes .
the look of orphanhood and dejection in their eyes .
my friend did not give any reply and it was not clear to either of us that he knew where we were heading ; a silence descended , broken only by the hum of the engine and the noise of the road .
the center is campaigning against the increasing spread of cell phone transmitters . these transmitters are not environmentally sound and are found in densely populated areas . they impact dangerously on the environment and on the health of citizens . the center has received a complaint from a citizen who has been harmed by the presence of one of these transmitters on the roof of the building in which he lives in the cairo neighborhood of helmet el zaytoun .
according to the complaint , he continuously hears irritating noises and he can feel vibrations in the walls and doors of the house because of this transmitter .
the center , in solidarity with this citizen , has filed an official report at the ayn shams police station .
the report number is 480 for the year 2005 . it was sent to the office of the prosecutor general , which announced the possibility of asking the national institute for standards to assign one of its experts to take the necessary measurements at the apartment . the results corresponded completely to the citizen 's complaint and confirmed the existence of extremely dangerous impacts on the environment , his health and the health of his children .
the center submitted complaints to : the national telecoms regulatory authority on 1 / 30 / 2005 ;
the minister of state for environmental affairs on 1 / 31 / 2005 ;
and the governor of cairo on 2 / 7 / 2005 .
in addition it submitted a complaint to the central department for environmental affairs at the ministry of health on 2 / 15 / 2005 .
it is known from an investigative report that these transmitters are not environmentally sound .
they cause deformities in the joints and have extremely grave effects on the digestive , urinary and reproductive systems .
therefore , the center asks all parties responsible for these transmitters according to the licensing protocols between the cell phone companies and the minister of state for environmental affairs and the ministry of health to review the continued environmental effects of these transmitters , and their suitability , particularly in the middle of densely populated areas .
the center asks ngos and citizens to confront this problem procedurally ,
and announces that it is prepared to support and cooperate in taking all the necessary steps to face the threat of the cell phone transmitters .
cairo , 2 / 20 / 2005
from today 's newspapers : wednesday
first news item , al-rashed asks :
in his interjection , member of parliament al-rashed directed strong criticism towards the energy minister sheikh ahmad al-fahd , because the latter was present with the police during the umm al-hayman operation and carried a weapon .
al-rashed said that this was inappropriate
and in what capacity did he participate ?
and with what right ?
he wondered about the situation
what if he had been injured or killed , god forbid .
that would have given the terrorists a great victory .
and also what if he had injured someone , that would have been a criminal charge .
members of parliament khaled al-adwah , mukhalad al-azmi and hussein al-qallaf defended minister al-fahd and said that this step demonstrates his courage and his service to his homeland
the first probability : if he was injured ,
we wish , then at least he would be withdrawn from office after that .
the second probability if he killed someone ,
easy , we cover it up and make a statue of him , and exhibit it next to his father 's car in front of the olympic committee .
it is all the same . . .
the father died without firing a single shot , and they made him into a hero , and wrote poems about him in the manner of the great classics .
so why would it be different for the son .
we make a statue for him - while he is still alive - in the same manner as the sphinx and we put it next to abdul - hussein 's pyramids . then we allow the public to do what ozzy osbourne ( did ) in 1982 on the alamo in texas
the second news item : " sources indicated that amer confessed that his brother nasser is the perpetrator of the hawalli square murder , killing fawaz al-utaibi and shooting the two martyrs al-ayubi and al-rashoud .
the sources said that the arrest of the muhsen al-fadli cell has become imminent because the police are monitoring their movements .
the sources revealed the information that " upon the arrest of amer , he was very agitated , and so afraid he peed himself in the special forces vehicle . he said : " i will confess to you without question . "
a leader of a terrorist group , who kills in cold blood , pees himself after his arrest . in another piece of news he shouts " i don 't want to die " .
what more proof do we need of the " justice of the cause " he fights for ?
when feelings for the other begins . at the start it is still a new and beautiful thing .
we discover each other and we learn new things we don 't know about each other .
also , we do things that make our loved one express hidden feelings inside him .
they went out to dinner together , then they rose to dance together for a little bit .
it is very crowded , they move closer .
there is still a distance , no problem , they move still closer . thoughts go through the mind of the little ostrich , and maybe in his head as well .
she is hesitant and nervous , but still she continues : - )
one thing tells her , come on finish what you 've started , and another pulls her away .
suddenly she decides to rid herself of all restraints and do what she feels , nothing stops her . it is time for the feelings to pour out . : - )
then it was time to go back : - ( it had to come , but both of them are reluctant to leave . they want to stay like this forever .
they decided to go together somewhere far away , where no one will disturb them . there , they will spend the rest of the night together . . . they went to his nest because it was far away , to continue their evening there . they sat next to each other , talking . they continued to dance to their favorite music , the beautiful ostrich music .
the feelings started to surface then .
hot kisses , and strong embraces . the heat is great , they still go on ! ! ! ! lucky them : - ) now you will be able to know what she wants with just a look from her eyes into yours .
now you will be even able to know when she will laugh and when she will cry , and what will you do now .
will it always be like this , or will there come a day , when they will be bored with each other ?
this is a little piece of the story of a little ostrich . the moral we learn from this story though , is " the most beautiful thing is doing away with restraints and following the heart in expressing feelings " .
the heart beats for the first time ,
yes this is my sweetheart , with whom i will stay all my life .
we live the illusion , love to our heart 's content , and live our happiest days .
then all at once , all this disappears as if there was nothing at all ! !
i wonder where all this love is gone ?
and once more the story starts from the beginning , and it is always the same ending .
until when no one knows .
i think many people live through this stage ,
sometimes they remain there forever .
but we wonder who is the right person this is the dilemma .
we keep comparing them until in the end we stay alone .
at the end two remain . i wonder which of them is the awaited one ? ? ?
it was my initial mistake that i did not introduce myself .
i am madam ostrich .
and i am the largest bird , taller than a man .
i can 't fly , but i have long legs that enable me to run at a high speed of between 50 - 70 km / h .
i live in semi - desert areas and valley , especially those where trees do not grow .
i feed mainly on seed and grass .
and because of our importance , we ostriches , they have started to spread evil rumors about us ; among them the story of us burying our heads in the sand ,
i explained in previous writing that this is untrue .
also there are many conspiracies , among them these : many conspiracies .
there is also a novel by the egyptian novelist rauf musaad called : ostrich egg .
this is information for myself so that we ostriches do not forget our beauty .
mimi
madam ostrich ma ' am ,
i read this verse from the poet asad ali : and in the war an ostrich of malleable wing startled by the noise of a whistler .
i understand the first part , but i do not understand what malleable means , someone please guide us .
but the meaning of the verse is also not flattering to you madam ostrich ma ' am , and i hope your teeth are better .
hear hear , my friend the elephant ( the traffic officer ) , pretends that he understands everything .
i don 't know how traffic officers think in this jungle .
i always used to go and visit my friends in a particular area ;
the way to get there is very easy .
( maybe the residents of that area are colluding with the traffic officers to draw all their friends to them , so that they are not able to return to their nests . )
there are many obstacles on the way back , however ; one of them is very significant .
my friends ' nest is on a little rise , and as i come down to my nest there are little turns between the nests . i made use of them as a short cut .
two days ago , while i was on my way , i found that the elephant my charming friend , had blocked these turns to disgust me as i was going home .
is all of this a conspiracy to prevent me from visiting my friends ?
i really don 't know what will happen now .
of course it is very irritating and i am extremely infuriated .
the day before yesterday , the moon was huge and looked wonderful
and since i am an ostrich with tender and sensitive feelings , i chose a spot in the jungle to watch the beautiful full moon .
and all of a sudden , when i had barely feasted my eyes on the beauty of the moon , a strange animal came out of the blue to me and said :
" it is not allowed to sit here ostrich , it is best for you to go before someone comes and makes you leave in an unpleasant manner "
god , where should i go
i mean i want to look at the full moon ,
and then , am i doing something wrong ?
i am just sitting in my place , looking quietly and observing the full moon and the beauty of the sky .
even in the jungle i can 't find a quiet spot where i can look at the moon .
shame on them and their stupidity .
but by the way , i thank god also that the day ended peacefully and only came to a quarrel with a strange animal ,
better than the earthquake that happened at the same time in another spot .
alef
unfortunately the whole jungle is forbidden to its residents .
in most cases , prohibition is the measure they think will preserve ethics and morals . poor them .
in the crowded jungle there isn 't a place where one can be by himself without an animal appearing from under the ground .
speaking of the different reactions after the taba explosions . all cars entering the waiting areas of hotels are now searched ; the details of the vehicles and their drivers are also put on record ! !

in aswan , helmut ratait told me how the police forbade him to walk around the emptiness of the sandy rises west of the nile .
helmut is an avid traveler , he has visited 40 countries of the world in the last fifty years . his limp and his advanced age has not stopped him .
only in egypt , which he visited twice , has he encountered the curfew you are talking about .
of course what the tourist faces is mostly for fear of the consequences of exposing them to danger .
the local person on the other hand is taken " on suspicion " wherever and whenever he is .
at the alexandria library , there will be a celebration for the 102nd anniversary of the birth of the danish writer hans christian andersen .
his birthday is on the 4th of february , which means that he is an aquarius .
whatever ,
this author is one of the greatest children writers . i myself love him though i don 't know him at all : - )
i remember the cartoons which used to be shown on tv at different times . they stopped showing them now , although they were really great .
there was a character in a story which i can 't remember right now , the character was a cat called the marquis calabas ,
the problem was that the film was in arabic and of course the translation wasn 't that good .
and as a little girl who did not understand anything , i used to learn stuff by heart and that 's it .
and that was the name that i remember .
but he was a very exasperating character in the story and also very tiresome , but i really liked him : - )
there were also many other stories that this man wrote for children , but i need to sit and remember them though .
and i am busy now . i have a meeting with the tiger i encountered in the desert .
i went to the bank near my work in the same jungle where i live . i wanted to pay back some of my debts which i am really tired of .
and as i was on the way ( walking of course on my long lovely legs ) i was frowning
surely anyone in the same position would have to frown ; withdrawing from here and putting it there .
well , i deserve this because i brought it all on myself .
anyway , while i was going back to the nest , all of a sudden it rained .
and i found myself happy and joyous ,
while all the animals were running to hide from the rain ,
i was the only one walking in the rain with a huge grin on my face , and was extremely happy .
my friend the elephant advised me to hide so that my feathers ( which people make into pillows ) wouldn 't get wet ,
but of course i never listen .
it continued raining heavily . the streets were washed , and also the sad trees which nobody ever thought of washing or spraying since they showed up on the surface of the earth .
well , this was a great opportunity for them to get watered and washed as well .
with the falling rain , some animals who had contemplative and calm minds , and those with gentle hearts sat to watch the universe around them .
they watched closely at how the rain can wash everything around and how it can also wash the creatures ' hearts .
this makes me think as well , that a small drop of water can produce miracles .
mimi
i also love the rain very much ,
it brings blessing and cleans the world .
you reminded me of a trip with my college friends to alexandria
we spent two days there in february ,
the rain was very heavy and continuous ,
nobody was on the streets , only us , and we were so happy with the rain .
but this time with grandma duck and my mother .
we went out for dinner .
each of us was dressed up and stylish , only because we were going out together .
and when we arrived at the place , grandma changed her mind ;
no i don 't want to eat here , i don 't like the place ,
lets go somewhere else
( well where should we go go sit by the nile a little , there is a very nice club where we are members ( you know of course that ostriches are very athletic ) . we can eat there .
my answer was no , because it was too cold for me ,
so where should we go yes , i remembered a place they used to go out to in the old days and it was in the middle of the jungle .
lets go and relive old memories and have a hot drink to warm ourselves up .
at last we agreed : - ) and we went to this nice place ,
we had the hot drink and ate the delicious sweets .
grandma duck told me about her memories of the place and about the centre of the jungle with its old streets , and the touristy places there .
and how in the past they used their legs to walk long distances without tiring .
but they enjoyed the company and the area .
i spent a nice evening with grandma duck ,
i hope to repeat it soon .
communication through this information net is dazzling .
you speak with strangers as if you have known them for a long time . and we haven 't even met in the first place .
it is very strange , i am amazed .
this net brings people amazingly close to each other , but something always happens .
not really always , but it often happens ;
we imagine the people we talk to , and when we meet them it is a surprise , ha ha ha ,
someone completely different than what we imagined .
actually it never happened to me , but it happens a lot : - )
also what i don 't like about the conversations through the net ( chatting ) , is that the animals talk to each other and say things that sometimes can be misunderstood .
i mean this is not the appropriate way to express anything ,
i prefer meeting face to face .
hamuksha
i don 't agree with you ostrich .
i admit that chat rooms with unknown individuals or groups are no more than a waste of time and silliness in most cases , although there were some interesting meetings with people .
but forums and blogs created healthy and intelligent methods of connection and communication .
there are people whom if i met on the street , it wouldn 't have been possible to be introduced or even to warm to them .
the dress style , hairstyle , gait , sex , individual behavior and social status all create a disturbance in the dialogue between two minds . and this is what internet applications have cancelled or reduced considerably , and replaced with alternative relationships .
and meeting internet acquaintances is only strange in the beginning , but later the appearance will not have the same effect .
i say that from very personal experience ,
my group of friends ( approximately 20 ) are all forum acquaintances .
r
what hamuksha is saying is nice
not only this , but sometimes an acquaintance through chat or instant messaging applications is more honest than a physical acquaintance , for the same reasons explained by hamuksha .
but of course i don 't agree with anonymous entry into chat rooms , because then the sheep you are talking to may turn out to be a wolf .
let us take an example from what ha . did to other bloggers .
hamuksha
add to this the issue of age too ,
i know for example at least two people , one of them a teenager and the other middle - aged , how else could there be a dialogue between them in any other way than this ?
and on the subject of courage , it happened to me many times that i entered into conversations with girls i see every day , but with instant messengers things are completely different .
we explore issues that i would have never thought they would approach in actual life ,
and when i asked some young men they confirmed the reason that i already thought of ; it is because there is no meeting of the eyes .
i mean there is no eye contact .
madam ostrich
i agree with you , but sometimes things get out of hand , and become strange .
i read what hamad wrote about the sea and his accident .
, and i thought immediately of the worst nightmare in my life
in fact they are two in one , i mean two things happen in one nightmare , from which i wake up frightened .
one of them is linked to water . and the water form in my nightmare isn 't a sea or an ocean but a lake : lake nasser the nightmare starts normally : i am sitting in a boat on the lake , it is cold and dark
, and the lake is big , the water is black ; it is a real scary sight
, and i am barefoot in the boat
that 's it , that 's what i remember of the dream when i wake up
, and then i am always startled , unhappy and pulling a looong face .
tomorrow and the day after tomorrow i have , get that , training
and where is this training ,
in an area of a jungle i do not like .
they forced me to go and i do not want to .
you have to go madam ostrich ,
all the animals have taken this training except you , and therefore you have to go and take it in this area .
my dear tears flowed ,
i felt sorry for myself ,
but what can i do , i have to go .
unfortunately , i will stop writing for two days , maybe three , depending on the state of my health after the bitter experience .
glimmerman
whoever hears you going on like this will think that you are going to take some military special forces training ! ! pull yourself together now , and be a courageous ostrich . shurouq
today i added a new blog from professor r . to my blog . i called it pictures talk .
because it can actually happen that we are unable to express what we want with words , while with only a picture we can communicate information or anything else we want , provided that the picture is really expressive .
r .
thank you madam ostrich for linking my blog , and thank you for your comment there .
but " professorship " is too much for me , and for bloggers .

i saw this map , and it was obvious of course that it depicted the old world .
i wonder , if the world had remained that way
( i do not mean the geographical shape , of course . because really , it is not possible to stop earthquakes and changes that happen in the earth )
but the general shape of the old world
without globalization , privatization , communism , radicalism , dictatorship and all the other things with numerous designations
would it have been better than what it is right now
or would we also complain and wish that we were in another world by the way , when i first saw that picture i wanted to write something else about it , something that relates to the jungle i live in .
, but with all the events happening around us , i changed my mind and wrote this .
it is too cold for me these days ,
my feathers aren 't helping me in the cold ,
i don 't know what to do ?
the feathers aren 't warm enough for me ,
i don 't know what 's up with me , am i growing old or what ?
i was watching a fashion show with my friend the tiger , and suddenly a model showed up wearing his skin ! ! ! !
my goodness ! !
i mean , they threaten an animal with extinction so that they can wear its fur or make purses and shoes out of its skin .
it is sad ,
of course silence and sadness descended on the place , and yousuf was very emotional .
they ruined our evening , may god ruin it for them all .
i will go back to hibernation , warm myself with my heavy layers , and drink cinnamon and tasty hot beverages .
r
madam ostrich , it is best that you hide well in your hibernation , because those who took yousuf 's skin need your feathers to make a pillow on which they can rest comfortably .
they are also the ones who eat mr. gazelle , and of course they ride professor horse .
and even professor pigeon did not get mercy from them and they did not leave him alone , although he delivers their letters
and although . . .
i am very hungry , so i am going to eat a little meat to bolster my strength .
madam ostrich
even cattle egret isn 't taking it easy on himself , and thinks only of his stomach .
i was very much affected .
long ago he had a plan to get rid of his small paunch .
well , meet me if this happens with professor elephant at the mouse 's hole .
i was talking to my new friend the cattle egret ,
the conversation was hurried , but i discovered a new trait in him : curiosity .
cattle egret turned out to be very nosey .
after the quick conversation , i remembered the character of nosey in majed magazine .
i searched for nosey . i kept looking for him in stories and pictures , and in the end i would see a small character squeezed in the middle of the pictures , behind a tree , under the chair or beside the bed .
something that is not really obvious , ha ha ha , very funny .
by the way , the ostrich can also be described as nosey ,
i discovered that also a while ago : - )
rayhane najib
salam ( greetings )
there are some things that we forget as time passes
i don 't know how you remembered nosey from majed magazine .
the first thing we did when we bought the magazine , was to look for this strange creature , and try to see who will be able to find him first
thank you for reviving the memory
r
1 ) about the cattle egret
as you and the readers know : cattle egret cleans the earth of worms .
and he has to have very sharp eyesight to see small worms in the middle of large land , abundant water and grass .
cattle egret also has wisdom and a discerning ability : .
he can differentiate between the real worm and a piece of twine or string .
all of this might be seen by some as curiosity , but rather it is discernment .
do not forget that the worm will become a butterfly ! ! !
2 ) about curiosity
curiosity is a trait that can be good or evil , depending on the intentions of the person and on the way he uses this trait .
i mean curiosity might reveal concern and a person 's devotion to his brothers in humanity .
it might also reflect " meddling " and interference between the " onion and its skin "
( and the outcome is of course its stench )
therefore some people like the curiosity of their friends and reject their lack of curiosity and consider it carelessness .
whereas others denounce the curiosity of their friends and might consider it " brazenness " .
in arabic curiosity is the plural of the singular word ' favor ' .
from the advice of a poet to his son ( as i remember it ) :
oh usayd , if you acquire money then go forth with it agreeably .
take honorable people as friends if you can .
if you befriend the honorable you will know their good favor
3 ) about majed magazine :
i thought many times of mentioning majed magazine in my blog .
because we discussed at length what made an impression on our childhood , such as songs , television series , and ideas . and majed magazine - without a doubt - made an impression ( with lazy , nosey , knowledgeable , moza and even the lame jokes ) . majed made an impression on the whole arab world . it contributed to creating a form of common culture between arab - speaking countries .
i liked majed 's competitions ,
some of the questions and answers angered me . but the magazine was on a higher level than the similar egyptian magazines .
majed 's superiority is undeniable .
is it still published ?
ahmed nasr
the first thing i remembered when i read the title was majed magazine and searching for nosey .
, rami
here you can see dana and salma on the cover of the latest issue
http : / / www . emi . ae / home . asp madam ostrich
i checked the magazine 's page and i found shamsa standing on salma and playing with madam ostrich ha ha ha aaa .
hamuksha
i still search with the children in my family for nosey .
eve
the magazine had a huge effect on me as well , i kept buying it regularly for many years .
it is true that i only won two or three times in its competitions , but it was a great thing for me .
after that , the artists started to change the look of the regular characters ,
and i discovered that the magazine had given me all that it could , so we separated .
alef
yeah . . . nosey and his glasses , hat and shoes : - )
my father used to get us the magazine every wednesday when he returned from work , and my brother and i would snatch it from him .
we had dozens of issues stacked on special shelves . we used to call them " majed magazine shelves " .
we kept the issues in mint condition , and even after many years they looked like they were from last week . .
we were able to remember everything inside an issue , no matter how old , just by looking at its cover .
i followed the appearance of characters and the disappearance of others
the first to disappear were the camel patient and the gang of four , shamsa and dana ,
my father used to tell us about the artists ' styles at the time , especially since he was acquainted with most of them : hijazi , al-labbad , eyhab and others .
we still keep a few books of compiled stories from very lazy and zakia the intelligent .
the first letter i ever sent was to the competition page , which we fold to make into an envelope . i never won though . .
i remembered this a few days ago in siwa , when it occurred to us to send postcards to our families ,
a friend of ours said that this will be the first letter her daughter will receive .
i went with the gazelle and the bear to a concert in the jumhuriya theatre .
the band was well - known in the past ,
but they stopped playing a long time ago .
the band is " andromeda " .
they play the music of pink floyd and other groups .
but this concert was only for pink floyd music .
the first time i heard them was last august in the open theatre at the opera .
the concert was great , and i decided to follow the group and go after them everywhere ( a groupie , i mean )
this time i was sitting in the first row in front of the stage ,
and since the concert was in a closed theatre , there was no place to jump and interact with the music ,
but still the audience was very emotional ,
particularly an animal that i cannot describe because he was sitting behind the bear .
he was very excited ; shouting and singing loudly . he was completing the song by himself and making sound effects even after the band stopped playing .
he was very comical but also very annoying : - )
in the previous concert , the gazelle and i used the intermission to speak with the band members and ask them to play specific pink floyd songs ,
but as i said before this concert was in the jumhuriya theatre , and therefore we weren 't able to request particular songs during the intermission .
after the intermission they played exactly the songs that we wanted ( what a coincidence )
as the music played i got lost in it and entered the pink floyd mood or state ,
and i started looking closely at each member of the band
the drummer was very emotional ,
i imagined him in two states , maybe he is happy with the band but miserable in his life ,
i imagined that music is his whole life . that he neglects his family and therefore his wife curses the day he started playing music ,
the other state is that he may be evil ! ! ! i don 't know why ,
i was amazed , the bass player is like a perfect aristocratic gentleman .
he is a responsible young man ( like for example , ali , the son of a respected family ) . he is good at school and plays guitar at the same time .
he went to a top college and excelled , and he had a family . when a member of the band asked him to join them he agreed .
so he plays in his free time , and still has a brilliant career and cares for the family .
the guitarist , the extremely cool young man , who plays the guitar as his friends cheer on .
by the way the enthusiastic supporter was one of his friends : - )
the last member of the band is the keyboard player . i find him very mysterious .
because he wears dark glasses as he plays ,
but after the concert i asked him about the reason for wearing these glasses .
he explained that they were prescription glasses , and also because he was nervous because of the audience .
i want to explain that these previous descriptions are the fantasies of madam ostrich .
in fact , i do not know the band members .
anyway i am following them , and i will go to the next concert god willing on 04 / 09 / 2005 .
r
madam ostrich . . .
can i understand exactly what the difference between the three articles about the band are ?
alright . . i will read : )
but why should i read three ?
r
hee ! hee !
what ?
april 9th 2005 ?
how fortuitous how fortuitous
remember that i will be 33 on that day ( if i am still alive ) , and ask the band to blow the candles out for me .
yes . . 9th of april . . the day baghdad fell . .
and a black day in the life of rwanda ( as i learned from the movie )
a day that some historians think was the day of christ 's crucifixion ( or his likeness for some )
- madam ostrich
never mind r . i don 't know what happened , anyway there is only one left .
and happy birthday to you : - )
alef
what a fortunate coincidence , i came across pink floyd two days ago and i am blogging about their friend dna .
storm - petrel : - )
my first encounter with this wonderful group was in a ' 94 concert
for the group monsters of rock &amp; masters of metal . their performance was professional without any exaggeration , and captivated the hearts of the audience . they also won the prize for best band in that concert .
i heard lately that the group has made a comeback , but a lot of its original members are no longer there . i salute them wherever they are
and if anybody knows something about them , please inform me and god will bless him for this good deed .
yasser shaaban ( vocals ) ehab qale ' i ( guitar ) dr. amjad zaki ( bass guitar ) shareef shaaban ( drums ) and amr hassan ( keyboard ) .
we hope to find you well on the 9th of april .

umrah costs an egyptian person between 5000 and 10,000 egyptian pounds . this depends on the timing of the umrah " whether it is during ramadan , the summer or similar " and on the type of accommodation and transport " whether standard or luxury " .
on the other hand the expenses for hajj are at least 20,000 per person .
and this if we keep in mind that the touristy and luxury hajj through clubs and private organizations can cost over 30,000 egyptian pounds .
last year an egyptian businessman rented a luxury flat near the haram for the duration of the hajj season . it cost him 40,000 egyptian pounds .
with a simple calculation , we find that egyptians spend millions of pounds annually on this activity . it is not an exaggeration to say hundreds of millions even , and i will not venture into the billions because i do not have accurate statistics .
i am not an economic expert , but according to my limited understanding , the largest part of this tremendous amount comes from the money cycle in the egyptian market and pours into the saudi market .
only the crumbs return to the egyptian market , through travel agents , local brokers , egyptian airlines or through the money transfers from egyptian expatriates working in saudi arabia , and also through egyptian goods sold in the gulf .
whereas we find that the actual cost on the saudi economy , for building facilities and other services does not amount to this large sum , because the fixed assets do not wear out " the kaaba , haram , mina and mt . arafat " .
which means that , from a commercial viewpoint , this deal is 100 % profitable for the saudi economy .
i am not against the saudi state , but spending this amount of money might be acceptable in societies of the gulf region " which do not spend a quarter of this amount on hajj and umrah " .
but under a failed political and economic system such as ours , where 50 % of the population sink under the global poverty line " less than one dollar a day " and in a society like ours where most young people suffer the problems of unemployment , inhumanely long working hours , poverty , political frustration , repression , marginalization , trivialization , sexual repression , and emotional frustration . the latter is due to the absence in the opportunities for marriage and starting families on one hand and the non - existence of opportunities for free relationships outside the institution of marriage on the other . in view of all this , spending all this money becomes a matter of foolishness .
i suggest , and i know that i do not have any deep knowledge of religion , that egyptians should stop going for hajj and umrah trips for a period of 5 years , while the wealthy use their hajj expenses annually to help the financially lower classes .
i think that 20,000 egyptian pounds is enough to marry off an average egyptian man , or to start a small stable project .
and i think that for the argument of bad deeds and good deeds , the divine reward for the alternative solution will be more than the afterlife rewards for rituals , movements , and gestures which probably only a quarter of those who perform them do so from their hearts .
and by the way , what i am saying applies automatically as well to the displays of capitalist extravagance , in the form of weddings which cost hundreds of thousands of pounds for a single ceremony .

http : / / www . islamonline . net / arabic / news / 2004 - 12 / 05 / images / pic05b . jpg this picture is taken by the blogger " taq hanak "
i just want to comment on the issue from another angle .
azzam azzam is an israeli citizen , who served the israeli state dutifully . his country did not forget him and kept trying all means to save him until it succeeded . so that he came out and said , israel does not forget its sons .
in the eyes of the israelis , azzam is a national hero , whom the country honored and strove to help in every way possible . meanwhile here in egypt we forget the real heroes who fought in the wars of october , the three slain soldiers or even suleiman khater who was accused of insanity and suicide .
ibrahim said , khaled bibo and hazem imam are our national heroes ,
we have three streets in cairo and alexandria named after the national heroine suad husni . we also have a street for the former dancer hayatem in the stanley area of alexandria , whereas we do not have one street named after abdel - ati the tank hunter .
therefore i regret not being an israeli citizen .
mohammed
if we disregarded that azzam is an arab druze and a spy , then we can say that he is a good citizen , and of course you are right when you say that the israeli citizen has value and a government that looks out for him , whereas we don 't have any value .
and until we choose our governments or at least until there is some form - any form - of feedback between the two sides , we will remain without value . . .
and this is what i said when i saw the government clinging to the six students as if it cared about them .

wagih aziz
december 19th at 8:00 pm in saqiat al-sawi , zamalek ,
i affirm to those who do not know wagih that they will enjoy themselves . for wagih , at least in my humble opinion , is the best egyptian artistic product in the last 10 years .
this is an introduction to wagih that i wrote previously in one of the music forums .
wagih aziz is the most important musical project to appear in the last ten years .
he is the most capable of carrying the banner of alternative songs along with mohammed munir .
wagih aziz composed some of munir 's most important songs such as : afsur ( bird ) , hia hia ( she is , she is ) , qalbak el - shater ( your clever heart ) , and mumkin min awil lamsah ( maybe from the first touch )
wagih also wrote songs for many other singers such as anoushka and simone
and he is the only one who composed songs for hanan madi while she was married to yasser abdel - rahman
he also worked on a number of plays and films , among them omar 2000 , and hysteria with ahmed zaki . he also worked in the wonderful masterpiece al-madina ( the city ) by yusri nasrallah and mayet boutique ( dead boutique ) for the national theatre .
he composed music to the lyrics of most of the great egyptian poets , such as fuad haddad , salah jaheen , magdy nageeb , mohammed al-nasser , ali salamah and others .
wagih produced two cassettes : billeyl ( at night ) in 1997 , which was produced by the cultural development fund and was not distributed commercially .
it is only distributed and not distributed in the fund box office at the mahmoud khalil museum and the opera
and others ; the second cassette recording appeared this year under the title zaalan shiwaya ( a little sad ) .
it is distributed commercially , or sold in music cassette shops especially in the al-haram area and san stefano in alexandria .
in my humble opinion this tape is the most important musical experience in the last ten years .
unfortunately a number of his important works did not appear on the cassette , such as zai ( like ) and ana sagheer ( i am small ) , min ihbati ( out of my frustration ) , adan el - deek ( rooster 's call ) , eirah ( borrowed ) , sultah ( authority ) , min haqqina nihlam ( it is our right to dream ) , and many others .

i do not know how long i will be able to resist .

my heart is with you lone wolf
we are all equal in humiliation , and all of us are expelled from a country we love , and which refuses to love us .
i do not think you will be able to stand saudi arabia .
if it was at all possible , then a cosmopolitan place like dubai is much better .

why did you turn down the offer
and was it attractive ?
lone wolf
oh yes , it was attractive
i turned down the offer , out of hate for living in saudi society . i won 't go into details , which you must surely know .
, and i do not how long i will keep refusing to go there
i do not have the problem of being attached to egypt like most egyptians , and dubai by the way is a very respectable city as a government , people and public order .

on that cold day in the winter of 1994 " when the winter in egypt was really winter " -
and during the morning assembly of the third month of my first year at high school
ayman handed me the first issue of a new children series called supernatural
he gave it to me to read sneakily during the first period . the name of the issue as far as i can remember was - the legend of dracula 's blood or similar somthing .
the writer dr. ahmad khaled tawfiq - was still a young writer at that time -
he was my guide and my introduction to the world of culture - through his trilogy of novels : supernatural , safari and fantasy .
he took me out of the narrow world of " man of the impossible " and his overly idealistic and illogical adventures
and from the detective works of mahmoud salem , which were filled with childish impatience " the five adventurers and the 13 devils "
i am indebted to dr. ahmed khaled tawfiq , because he opened my eyes onto a wide world of literature , poetry and international culture .
thanks to him i came to know dostoyevsky , pushkin , edgar allan poe , yusuf idris , kafka and many others whom my memory is not prepared to enumerate now .
dr. ahmad khaled tawfiq 's writings weren 't just children literature . he sprinkled many philosophic and cultural opinions throughout his novels , as well as psychological and social analysis .
i can almost assert with authority , that if he had temporarily left adolescent literature to write adult literature , he would have been one of the most important novelists of our time .
i will try to post excerpts of his works here at the first possible opportunity , to clarify my idea .
in fact the man has taught me lots and lots . he contributed to molding my personality during my adolescence years .
i wanted to write about him today because this month sees the tenth anniversary of my connection to his works .
by the way , i am not ashamed to read his works even now
i will not forget to thank dear hamuksha for reminding me of this , through his wonderful article about naguib mahfouz .
hamuksha
ahmed al-aidi of an takoun abbas al-abd ( to be abbas the slave ) , which received attention and appreciation in 2003 . see http : / / www . arabworldbooks . com / arabicliterature / review20 . htm
he said that he was influenced by the structure and style of dr. ahmad khaled tawfiq .
i think this contradicts the description of the latter 's writing as mere thrillers for adolescents .
i remember reading a couple of issues from the series of the supernatural novels , in the early nineties .
it confirmed to me what i already expected , that it was mostly an adapted summary of international horror and fantasy novels ( like dracula for example ) or borrowings from other horror stories such as zombie for example .
except for a few ( such as the story of navari , whose idea i like . i would have liked to have read more of it ) .
this manner of adaptation and sometimes blatant plagiarizing is common in popular paperback fiction , although it varies in its degrees .
so while nabil farouq for example absorbs what he reads and reproduces it in another form , which can sometimes be good and then bad at other times ,
we find someone like rauf wasfi , who isn 't shy of stealing the works of great foreign science fiction writers and claiming them for himself through translation .
nevertheless i read them regularly in the hope of picking up the few original ideas among the heaps of copied ones , but i stopped doing that now .
how can a writer say about himself that " my novels are more superior than agatha christie 's . . and more effective that dostoyevsky 's and naguib mahfouz 's " as was stated in the title of the second article in the previous comment ?
this , of course if this was true , what ahmed khaled tawfiq says and not a reformulation by sensationalist journalists .
please note that i did not read the article before i wrote this comment .
lone wolf
dear alef , of course the man did not say this literally ,
you know the " journa - rogueish " manner of inventing huge headlines from normal talk .
secondly , in fact , and except for very rare cases the man never said that he is inventing something new .
he knows exactly that he is playing on well - known and classical themes ,
but he " egyptianizes " them and puts a light philosophical and social sprinkling , just in the background no more , no less . as for rauf wasfi and nabil farouq that is a completely different matter is and i agree with you .
lone wolf
maybe i do not like naguib mahfouz very much , but of course i recognize his great value to arabic literature ,
although i do not see him as the greatest writer in egypt . however , i loved his adrift on the nile , and love under the rain which i think are his most profound works , where he went beyond just relating events into analyzing society .
my biggest complaint about naguib mahfouz is that he did not produce any " analytical " work since the end of the seventies , with the possible exception of love on the pyramid plateau
my friend sh . a . brought to my attention part of an interview which al-ahram held with him .
in this question : in the novel miramar , did the location of the miramar pension which overlooked the ocean symbolize nagiub mahfouz 's forecast of the era of globalization which egypt would experience later , and did the sea therefore symbolize the wider space we live in ?
my friend 's comment was :
miramar was written in the mid - sixties of last century , and signs of globalization , as some reiterate , only started in 1995 ; that was 30 years after the publication of the novel miramar .
whereas if you told any political analyst in 1989 that the soviet union will collapse he would have accused you of ignorance and insanity .
this then is journalistic pioneering , and this is our situation ,
and those who didn 't kill naguib mahfouz with defamation , killed him with more bitter and spiteful means .

mohammed munir is a strange person , and you can never expect what he is going to do in a concert .
sometimes i go expecting to see boundless creativity , then he surprises me with the worst possible performance from him as well as the rest of the band , in addition to a bad choice of songs and even disrespect to the audience .
sometimes i just go to see friends that i have missed and whom i only see at concerts .
but then he surprises me with the greatest performance and well - chosen songs .
in the end we have to admit that the ney and dokah flutist abdullah hilmi is half the group .
the problem always remains : how will i know whether the concert will be good or bad ,
prediction and personal intuition is the best solution , and also the location of the concert ,
the opera concerts have normally good standards ,
one witty person said , and he appears to be correct , that the concert depends on the type of " smoke " or the type of narcotic which munir handles before singing .
so if it was " banjo " the concert will be bad , and if it was " hashish " then the concert will be good .
and if this is the decisive factor , then i invite him to take up residence in alexandria , where we can help him to present the most beautiful concerts : ) ,
in general , thank you mohammed munir for giving me unexpected pleasure on new year 's eve .
by the way , one day after this , i was fortunate enough to seize two hours with al-warsha theatre company . they are presenting the show " halawat al-dunia " ( the beauty of life ) or cairo calling at saqiat al-sawi in al-zamalek until the end of the week .
it is compiled from parts of old shows , with the addition of some new parts .
the show is a real theatrical showcase and a huge acting effort ,
al-warsha is notable for its attention to detail , such as the scene at the church where the choir 's voices rise with hymns as the narrator says that the hero of the story is entering the church , then the voices drop when he says that the hero went out .
they always dazzle me with their acting abilities as individuals , and in the play in general . for example in the scene with the person performing a monologue of 4 characters : the priest , the church guard , the citizen and the viewer ; the actor used simple makeup : a single prop which turns from a priest 's beard , into a policeman 's hat , a viewer 's hat and a citizen 's hat .
i think that i was able to extract myself temporarily from the clutches of winter depression .

it has never happened that a culture has confined its whole musical heritage to a single subject , except in arab culture .
what i mean is the culture of the present arabic - speaking countries .
with the exception of individual experiments in north africa " rai music " - and in the levant " ziad rahbani - marcel khalifa " , egypt " sayed darwish - sheikh imam - mohammed munir " , and also the al-jeel revolution music in the eighties and lastly wagih aziz ; the lexicon of arabic singing is confined to 100 words on desertion , longing , and meeting , a single topic which is the relationship between males and females .
we might accept this from a nation that has sorted out all its problems and is suffering from boredom such as the swiss , swedish or canadians .
but if the nations who do this have half their citizens living under the poverty line , then this is a mystery fools like me cannot solve .
incidentally , i do not want our singing to turn into nationalistic and heroic odes , but rather to describe the reality of the people and not a particular policy or ideology .
of course you are asking what reminded me of this right now ? ? ?
in the taxi i was taking from sidi gaber to our house , on the radio i listened to a song by umm kulthum , who is called the legend and the mistress of arabic song . the song was composed by ahmad rami and says at its beginning : " i fear that your love for me is out of pity "
what sick mind wrote this ! ! ! ! !
and what sick mind chose it to be composed and sung
is there any real difference between this song and the lamentations and flagellation hymns of mustafa kamel ? ? ? ?

for one year after we graduated i kept in regular contact with r . - she is a graduate from the same class - very intelligent - one of the few women who really deserve to be called a programmer .
- but she wasn 't concerned with the overall grade or total because - and i agree with this - it is not an indication of the level of intelligence or technical ability . so she settled for passing and obtaining the grade satisfactory - although she was excellent in all practical and specialist subjects .
she entered a scholarship from the ministry of communication and obtained the certification of oracle certified professional . however she was certain that these certificates are useless since everyone passes after receiving the test king .
i tried to find a job for her at my place of work , but they refused to hire her because of her grade .
as she wanted to work , she joined the working team of a small " underground " company without a contract or insurance and with a very small salary , i didn 't hear anything from her after that .
a few minutes ago i met my friend a . a . on messenger . he works in saudi arabia ,
and he told me that she finally decided to return there - where her family has lived and worked for the past 15 years - she will be working there as a mathematics teacher in a high school .
since ladies cannot work in the field of engineering in saudi arabia .
she did that after she lost hope of finding a respectable job in egypt .
frankly , the news saddened me .

pride in the profession is what made me write what i did about the situation of r specifically .

or the anthropologist who is forced by his need for employment to work as a social sciences teacher in a junior high school .
but this does not contradict the fact that i have many misgivings about gulf societies , and particularly saudi society which represents to me the glaring stereotype of the nightmare i do not wish
, but i do not expect egypt to be like this any time in the future , and we can set aside a separate article for this later .
and you have honored my humble blog with your visit .

as usual he was late . my friends and i arrived to the airport before him ,
i was anxious because if he had been a little later i would have left without saying goodbye , because i had to fetch my father who was traveling to the same country in a few hours .
yes man , you figure that if you miss the plane you will ride the microbus from ramsis to al-hijaz .
this behavior wasn 't strange for t .
one day we were playing that game where we choose an animal that each person resembles .
the group chose the sloth for him
he seemed very happy then , he even said that his behavior is really similar to that of this animal . he could stay in one room for up to three days , if he just had a television , books and an ample supply of tea with milk " the official nubian drink " .
when i was about to bid him farewell , he surprised me by taking out the novel nobody sleeps in alexandria by ibrahim abdelmajid
he said that he wanted to return it to me , but he did not read the last three chapters and asked me to make a copy and give him a summary of the remaining events .
i smiled when i imagined myself telling him in detail , what happened to domian and sheikh majd after they got lost in the desert , while his younger brother hurries over to the aircraft crew asking them to wait until he finished telling them .
man , stop acting stupid , take it with you , at least then you can remember your alexandrian friend there .
i gave him the solemn egyptian farewell : a kiss on each cheek with an embrace . i looked in his eyes and i saw a look of fear i had not seen in him before , and i found myself involuntarily saying be strong boy and toughen up .
he answered saying , toughen up
what man , i mean will the coming days be harder than the days in hurghada
when he finished saying goodbye to the rest of the group i glimpsed a tear in his eye which he managed to conceal so that he wouldn 't upset his family .
we preferred to leave , so that he could be alone with them for the last few remaining minutes .
i glanced quickly at them , and i saw him carrying ali , his three - year old nephew , who resembles him greatly .
i thought that i will certainly miss him .
his problems with his mother and his brothers , him constantly having to play the role of the big brother within the family circle , as a result of his family circumstance ; how he loves ziad rahbani and appreciates all forms of arts ; his cleanliness , the ritual of tea with milk or the " nubian tea " as he calls it , his constant talk about the alienation of the nubian , his impartial criticism of his ethnic society , an impartiality which i wasn 't used to , his flat at masr station , the meetings in that coffee house which we call the " club for hookah " , his firmness in the face of his problems .
after fifty meters the four of us buttoned our coats against the cold exactly at the same moment without arrangement .
h . w . said : guys i feel like we are in a movie
we laughed trying to hide our nervousness , but m . g . did not give us a chance , oh and in this moment the director should say

to start with , i would like to apologize for the length of what i have written this time . i would also like to apologize for the spelling errors , the disorder and the repetition of ideas in some parts :
for the first time in months , i am finding the psychological capacity to read a whole book .
the book is " hatha huwa al-mualem ya ' qub " by dr. anwar luqa , published by the higher press council
according to the author , the book can be considered a summary of the writings of shafeeq ghirbal and dr. louis awad , who are two of last century 's most prominent populists or advocates of egyptianism or pharaonism as some people like to call it .
the book by the way is not big , it is about 100 pages in small format , and therefore it did not go into details , but it is in any case the first research work i am reading about this controversial personality , teacher ya ' qub .
in all the past years i have settled for knowing less than touch ups about this person , whom most egyptians view as a traitor and an agent .
teacher ya ' qub , who later became a general in the french army , as most of you know , is the founder and commander of the coptic legion during the french campaign in egypt . he left with the departing campaign and died on board its outgoing ship . he was probably killed with a slow - acting poison , which hussein pasha gave him on their meeting one day before the trip .
before anything else , i disagree with most egyptians when they view ya ' qub as a traitor . he was a man who did what he believed was in the interest of his religious minority , and this is his right . the problem however is that the advocates of populism and among them are unfortunately heavy - weight scholars who give the man legendary dimensions , as the first egyptian hero , who thought of liberating egypt from the clutches of the turkish occupation . they also give him credit as a brilliant economic and political thinker .
during the next period i reserved my final judgment on the man until i read more from the " other side " which describes him as a national hero . the problem however was that the book drowned me in even more questions .
i discovered for example that ya ' qub , who was born in malwi in assiut , worked for suleiman pasha the mameluke - one of the men of ali bey the great - the treasurer of asiut . ya ' qub was his representative in all his businesses , and among them of course the iltizam ( tax farming ) ( ) , which means that he was actually working against the interests of the people in his town .
and from another angle , the man was subservient to the mamelukes , which prevents him from being " the liberator of the nation and the leader of its rejuvenation "
i think what we all need to agree on , is that ya ' qub was a first - degree pragmatic . because despite the objections of his church he married a catholic , a daughter of aleppo merchants who , a few years earlier , had succeeded in extracting customs taxes from the jews .
he also served the turkish mamelukes and worked as an agent for their treasurer .
this means that ya ' qub 's personal ambition , in my humble opinion , blended with his religious bent , to achieve spiritual and economic gain . this is what we see today in bourgeoisie satellite channels such as iqra ' and almajd and others .
for example the legion that he founded was not joined by a single muslim , something that is illogical if he really had intended to achieve a national secular goal , without a religious background .
after leaving egypt , the fate of that legion was to join the french army , where it was called - ironically - the mameluke legion .
after the collapse of the french republic some of them even worked as models for orientalist artists such as delacroix .
i reached the conclusion that teacher ya ' qub was an ambitious person , who tried to mix the secular with the religious , while also trying to adjust the situation of his religious denomination . he was not a national progressive liberator who foresaw civilization and the market economy . he never predicted positive neutrality as dr. anwar luqa and dr. louis awad and other populists claim . no , in fact he decided to leave egypt after the collapse of the french campaign .
the diaries of the captain of the british ship on which he departed - according to the same book - indicates that he tried to pass information to the leaders of the english state , that he was ready to help them seize egypt from the turks , on the condition that he gets appointed for a leadership post .
in the end i need to say a final word that is " stuck in my throat " as we say in colloquial speech :
what makes me sick generally , are the manipulative books with one - sided ideas , which defend these ideas and try to obliterate their shortcomings and turn them into virtues , those virtues which idiots like us are unable to understand . whether these are religious books which try to reiterate their denial and excommunication of the other , or ideological books cheering and drumming for a specific theory , like nabil hilal 's book " egypt 's left : falsely accused " , also the historical books like this book of ours , which tries naively to tell us that less than a thousand egyptian emigrants who arrived in marseille after the french campaign are the reason behind the whole french orientalist movement .
the only passage in the book that i believed was the one about father yohanna al-saftashi , who spoke coptic and helped the scientist champollion solve the puzzle of the ancient egyptian alphabet .
perhaps , some people still remember dr. shawqi daif 's book about the egyptian poet ahmad shawqi . this book is " capable of rupturing the spleen " , and was prescribed reading for egyptian high school students a few years back .
the system of tax farming was invented by the ottoman rulers . in this system all land becomes the property of the sultan , but he does not deal with the peasant ; he assigns the right for collecting taxes in each area to a specific person . this concessionary undertakes to deliver government funds to the ruler and collects them personally .
the concessionary distributes the land to the peasants after he keeps the best land for himself for personal exploitation , the land becomes his and he employs the peasants to farm it through forced labor .

why should the arabs make peace with israel ?
if i were an arab leader , i would never make peace with israel at all .
this is normal . . . .
we have occupied their country , and it doesn 't concern them that god promised it to us , because their religion is not ours .
there has been anti - semitism and nazi concentration camps , but this was not their fault .
they see only one thing : we have come and we have stolen their country .
why should they accept that .

sons of whores , they begrudged me a few days of peace of mind .
i went in the morning to cavafy museum , which i discovered by chance during one of my evening tours a few months ago . i found it closed .
so i went to the movies to see the movie bab al-shams , to find that they removed it early because of a kevin costner adventure movie .
i apologize for the foul language .
omar language
ha ha ha
the winds don 't blow to lone wolf 's liking : ) enough
alef
yeah ! cavafy museum ! !
i have to visit it !
what does the museum contain ?
mohammed
bab al-shams is already withdrawn
and i thought i would still have a chance to see it when i go to egypt .
eisander al-armani in al-urubi had written a long review of the film in which he spoke about differences between the producer and yusuf shahin i think
sorry , can you please tell me the exact address of cavafy museum
the article said in the greek district . . .
do we have a greek district in alexandria of which i know nothing ?
lone wolf
alef : i have not been to the museum yet
i found it by coincidence some months ago , while i was walking in a small side street .
then on that day i found myself free and clear - minded
so i decided to go there , but it was closed . mohammed :
bab al-shams has really been removed from alexandria , but it is still showing in cairo at the galaxy cinema .
but i think it will be removed next week or the week after ,
the viewers are almost non - existent ,
i went two days ago , and the total audience was no more than 20 people
as for the cavafy museum it is at al-raml station ,
and surely we do not have a greek district in the actual sense of the word
but the museum is located in the same street where the greek orthodox cathedral is .
very close to the shijab restaurant if you know it , or easier still at the back of the sayed darwish theatre .
mohammed
i came upon two articles written by two young men about watching bab al-shams .
http : / / www . 20at . com / article . php ? sid = 930 http : / / www . 20at . com / article . php ? sid = 931 their review is somewhat impressionistic but it is spontaneous and expressive .

bab al-shams hasn 't been removed from the cinema to date

a little note : i do not revise what i write , neither for standard nor for language .
i consider the blog a form of mental vomit , not professional essays .
hamuksha
brother , i am fed up with your notes and references of this type
once you also said that you are " too insignificant " to be an advocate for anything in your blog
but talking here is the most magnificent issue .
and you have a lot to tell and you know how to express it .
what is professionalism then , and what is revision
then this " vomit "
" vomit " you unfair liar
what do we then call what samir ragab publishes
it 's best that you start showing some respect , or i will start a campaign to boycott your blog , and i will start with the signatures of saudi colleagues .
what really puzzles me is why , since you are a programmer , you don 't arrange your blog at least a little in substantial aspects such as alignment
lone wolf .
ok sir ,
please don 't bully me like that
i only wanted to write that because i received some remarks about the language and style .
and what 's up with samir ragab whoever
enough , i beg you . do you want the blog to show up in google 's search results for samir ragab .
as for being a programmer , frankly i am too comfy " in the informal dialect " to coordinate the blog , i do not know why .
i see it as wild and natural this way
can you believe that i still haven 't added a state counter to it
so that i can find out who enters and how they find it .
maybe i will recover from work stress and start organizing it soon .
just pray for me .

imagine yourself in tahrir square on a weekday , going into the mujamma ' to conclude a public matter .
what are your chances of finding your childhood friend amid this crowd ? ?
that 's what we call coincidence ,
imagine that the public servant who is responsible for finalizing your papers is that friend 's brother ? ?
surely it is not a coincidence , but i do not have a name for this phenomenon . some atheists go as far as saying that the world was created through a series of similar coincidences .
situation 1 : a group of former colleagues wanted to go on a trip to sharm - el - sheikh ,
i convinced them that siwa is a new place to avoid monotony
in the last minute i was unable to go because of work pressures ,
i found out that during the same time , three egyptian bloggers were visiting siwa .
alef , and madam ostrich , which means that this was an opportunity for the first meeting of egyptian bloggers in reality .
even more bizarre is that my colleagues returned to tell me about the educated young man , addicted to travel , that they met there ,
the idiotic expression of amazement on my face prevented me from denying that i knew him , but to be extremely private , i preferred to say that i knew him vaguely through a mutual friend .
more and more bizarre , is that i had met him less than a month ago , at the book fair in another coincidence .
situation 2 - life on mars : the kindly forty - something man from the human resources department , came into my office to print a document on the shared printer . he saw the cd cover for the " art is the foundation " show , lying on my desk , then he shouted at us , and which of you idiots knows fuad haddad then ?
i was depressed for the three remaining days of that week ,
i discovered that this average person , whom you can list in a dictionary as a definition of the form of an egyptian employee .
he was a leftist in the seventies , and a member of the tagammu party . he was previously imprisoned . he was also one of sheikh imam 's derwishes and kept an original lute from him .
weirder is that , in the eighties he used to sing for a band in alexandria . some of the musicians who played behind him went on to become musical icons of that era .
also , he guided me to another hidden treasure ; one of the project managers in my workplace .
he was a theatre ghoul during the same period , from the class of ahmad adam and iman al-bahr darwish . that was when the national theater used to present significant works .
note that i have been working in the same place for two years and many years could have passed without me knowing this , and i could have left this place completely without knowing .
some people call these events coincidences , some call it fate , and others call it the will of god , but i cannot settle for one definition .
note : if any blogging colleagues felt that his privacy was infringed with this article , kindly notify me .
hadduta
did you really record " art is the foundation " ?
i recorded it , but the sound did not turn out well : (
lone wolf
no ma ' am . there was a rerun of the show in alexandria , and after the show closed , an original recording was sold on cd
a copy costs only 10 egyptian pounds ,
this was supposed to happen at the hanager as well but there wasn 't enough time .
if you are interested i can find out for you where you can buy it in cairo .
madam ostrich
my friend a . and i call it fortuitous
sometimes fortuitous plays its strongest roles , and isn 't easy ,
for example on that siwa trip , we were in a quiet siwa restaurant . after some time , a group of young men sat next to us , they were talking nonstop .
and who did they turn out to be in the end
your friends
impossible stuff
fortuitous , you 've got to quit . that 's enough now : - )
hadduta
no , because one of my girlfriends works at the culture resource , but i thought that they only recorded it on video : )

madam ostrich : " we were in a quiet siwa restaurant . after some time , a group of young men sat next to us , they were talking non - stop , and who did they turn out to be in the end
your friends " firstly they aren 't my friends , but colleagues from my previous work ,
secondly , thank god i wasn 't present then ,
it is obvious that you were very annoyed with them ,
frankly , they are real chatterboxes : (
alef
small world really . .
you reminded me of the theory of six degrees of separation , which states that any human being in the world is separated from any other human being by six acquaintances , each of whom links to the other .
the idea however is to find out - out of all the permutations and combinations of links - the sequence they will take to reach a specific person .
at the beginning of the nineties there was a site that provided a service under that name .
saheb al-ashjar
smaller than we think .
madam ostrich
i didn 't mean any harm
i mean : - ) smaller than the smallest thing we can imagine .

one of my friends always says " this is the real size of the world .
who said in the first place that it was bigger than this ? "
this is also his opinion when we say " life is short " - : ) -
my friend mohammed who is the editor of the page " taq hanaq " moved me with his existential question : - " who dares to put stickers like these on car windows ? "
and in one breath he answered : - " not me . . . . ! "
justifying this humorously : ( besides i do not have a car : )
his phrase lacked exclamation marks
my dear sir : thank you
who of us has the courage to put this sticker on a jacket or pair of trousers or in the worst circumstances even dare to carry it in his wallet .
who of us can do that without fearing the trap of the police , traffic police or even his wife .
they succeeded , with remarkable intelligence in breaking up our self - esteem and our trust in our closest relations , but do not despair
i am now downloading this sticker on my computer and i will put on my page in solidarity .
that makes two of us now , is there a third ? !
y . mejahd
has my time come
i write now and i feel that thing
moving inside me again
i can 't take any more
all my masks have fallen and i am now forced to fight with a naked face .
good news for some : i am about to have a bout of depression !
so what 's new ? !
alright , don 't despair
maybe this will be the last depression i will pass through , maybe i won 't grant myself a wink 's respite to confess my sin .
and maybe you won 't read all this drivel because i won 't publish it
since i began preparing for the file : " three days that unmasked the regime " , and as i went deeper i felt the memory suffocating me .
i started feeling trapped , so i decided to resist and wrote the second part
and when i finished it i felt him whispering to me
i stood before my mirror and faced him smiling :
- i am ok
. . . . . . i am strong
but now i know that i have collapsed under the weight of all the pains and sins i carry on that shoulder
" these seven thousand years of slavery that i carry on my back "
so come on confess :
- i am not ok .
. . . . . . i am not strong
and now as we are on the verge of demonstration number 100013 , which will take place on the 12th of this month in front of the supreme court on ramses street , at 2:00 pm . the demonstration is held under the slogan " no to renewal . no to inheritance "
i find myself forced to confess to you and to you alone . i say it " master . . . . the camel has died
and the pot has fallen off his back and shattered ,
the water flowed out of it , mixed with his tears
the river has merged with the sea and we only reaped the isthmus
. . . . . . ! ! we only reaped the isthmus ?
ahaaaaa . . . . now i am really depressed ! ! ! -
so you carry on the walk by yourself
the ones who went before you have died and the ones who will follow you are thirsty
do not weep for me , my sword is broken
we were the logs to your fire and now you are the loggers
tell me where from ? !
and where to
we remain behind the doors , death surrounds us and blood frightens us
the cheering is blindfolded
tell me where from ?
and where to ?
will we arabs remain gagged between our jaws , our head bowed , hands or shoulders tied .
where to ? ! !
will we arabs remain crucified between the two jaws : the jaw of freedom and the jaw of zionism .
only the cheers of speechless silence we know
and only the stones in the hands of a child we throw
our dead
our wounded
even yohanna wasn 't spared
tell me where from ? ! . / / and where to ?
we will remain mortified like deer
we hide in coffins behind walls
the signs for the hour of resurrection are getting closer now
the freedom fighting bell ringer has died , died
and the arab nation is sterile sterile sterile
" fatima of the world "
oh brother i don 't understand
you sent an email and i advertised for you free of charge , then i go to the demonstration , to see that you made the timing half an hour earlier ,
and that you were preventing people from yelling
and then , what is this demonstration that lasts for only half an hour
well , maybe an hour
so why did you come , you should have sent a " missed call " , and spared yourselves and others the effort . no , and the people respected us and thought we were serious
and they circled the place and woke up the poor police officers early and all that for this metro demonstration .
by allah , this a waste
in the end , from you to the police forces , where are you going to hide from them
i am suffocating suffocating suffocating ,
can any dog explain to me what is happening
isn 't the demonstration at lady aisha enough
anyway , i am at home ,
peace be upon you ! ! ! !
no and without peace as well
where are you man ?
are you still suffocating or were you arrested ? ?
why don 't you calm down and send salutations to the prophet ?
i can 't go into my blog
can any knowledgeable person explain to me , is this a coup or what ?
anyway , never mind
maybe there is something wrong with me
it appears that until now i am unable to become a digital young man
in any case , i like the analog .
until today i trust only the paper and pen
it is true that he who has no past has no future
but i won 't give up easily . it is either me or mr. microsoft .
a little remark that i don 't think is important to anyone
i will return after the exams
do not dare pray
leave it to carry on like this , maybe it will be concluded with the protection of god .
your kiss is on par with the full moon abu mejahed
it 's best that you get digital
the future is for the white collars not the blue ones , my brother
you marxist !
by the way i am an old paper man
but in actual fact , here is a new and pure space
the socialism of knowledge and experience , and with it the growing value of the individual .

a dazed morning ?
what is meant by dazed here is not a dazed mind or conscious but just dazed everything
of course , you 'll ask me , with a tear falling from your eye . . .
what brought you back again my boy
why are you like this , don 't you know god is right and your good makes up for your evil ,
i 'm not making fun of you and don 't worry about me too much , i won 't try to be a star at the expense of those who were worried about my disappearance
anyway , i have two friends , my friend michel f . khater and my friend . . . don 't know if he 's an old one or not . . . hamushka
i swear by god almighty three times , on the lives of all your dead and the divorce of maliki , miri and hanafi , i 'm not a communist
i 'm relieved
i 'm just like you , a person going back to the beginning
the beginning is enough for me to die in peace , saying goodbye to your world without regret
anyway , wait for me in the next edition but i ask the lord not to wake me again
i just ask those who can show me the way to the beginning not to delay because i 'm waiting

when i lay in your lap , i 'm no longer afraid
do you think it 's possible ?

the popular campaign for change calls on all those who are weary of emergency states , totalitarianism , imprisonment and torture . . . all those who are weary of 23 years of mubarak 's rule . . . all those who reject hereditary rule in egypt . . . all egyptian men and women who signed the popular campaign petition rejecting renewal and hereditary rule . . . all nationalist and democratic forces to gather at the book fair on friday february 4 at one o ' clock in the afternoon

immediate amendment of the law on political rights to ensure full judicial monitoring of all stages of the election
let 's rally so that our voices can be heard as loudly as possible
our next meeting in on friday february 4 at the book fair , at one in the afternoon
i 'm only saying , if you intend to go to a demonstration , go , even if it 's in a state security office , but a book fair
why ?
no , that 's another story . . . i wouldn 't advise you to read it
why ?
oh , this incense burner
but i don 't understand
what 's wrong with a demonstration at the book fair ?
because it 's a really big place , maybe ? ? ?
i don 't understand !
?
always been used to people believing what they see ? my friend mohammed , moderator for the daq hink blog , asked me in a comment of his about a subject that has nothing to do with pleasantries
. . . i don 't understand , why a demonstration at a book fair
because the place is really big for example ?
? ? ? i don 't understand ! all i can do here is comment on how good his pages are and recommend everyone visits them so that they can benefit from it as i have benefited , my friend
we are slaves to experience , and if the word slave seems patronizing , my friend , have a look yourself so you can see and know
if i doubted that i would go one day in the end , i was surprised you added me to your page
it was a nice surprise for me
why don 't you teach me how to organize my page like yours so i can compete with you
i expect to see you on friday february 4 at one o ' clock in the afternoon at the book fair
from me to you and to your page , goodbye
mohammed
the problem my friend is that i 'm not in egypt at present and won 't be able to attend
frankly , i 've never demonstrated at a book fair before
. . . i 've had the experience of demonstrating in other places . . . unfortunately , i won 't be able to try it this time
can you tell us about your experience
. . . personal experience is not the only way of learning , the transfer of experience is also a fantastic tool
just explain to me , what 's the problem ?
: )

yes . . . to the release of everyone campaigning for change , the liberties committee of the journalists ' union invites you to its packed conference in support of those campaigning for change who have been arrested , including the journalist and member of the people 's council ayman nur and the leftwing journalist ibrahim al-sahari of the newspaper al-alem al-youm .
a number of key political and popular personalities will be speaking at the conference
on wednesday february 2 at 6pm at the journalists ' union 's headquarters , open invitation
your attendance . . . the first step on the road to obtaining freedom for all prisoners
it looks like your cairo has started to burn again
are you going to carry on hiding behind your page , suggesting watching as a way of learning
hasn 't the laziness ended , either join or perish and shut up
you are all the same to me
i was sitting reading through my old pages trying to find a new beginning
for more than a month now , my pen has not written enough to satisfy my conceit
leave that page , it 's full of mistakes , both linguistic and artistic , i know that but it 's no more than an attempt to continue that is doomed to failure . . .
up till now , i 've never had any comment about anything i 've written , whether negative or positive
every writer 's wish is to inspire the desire for dialogue with others - but all the comments i 've received have been no more than banter
look at most of the comments i 've had and you 'll know what i 'm talking about
they 're banter , my friend . i exclude the comments of
hamuksha and mohammed but why did they spring forth like a torrential stream to a place i wasn 't going to go near ?
yes , it 's the tricks of the subconscious again and drugs which make you confess to all you hate and so you purify yourself
i like strong drugs
i was saying that i was between sleep and waking - what is called in metaphysics " werewolf mode " - i was leafing through my old papers when i came across a tattered page which i apparently wrote quickly .
have you got time to read . . .
why am i asking , of course no - one reads this nonsense
it makes my stomach turn and my heart is heavy
there 's a crack in the dam and the water is pushing through so i open my mouth to speak
where someone was silent , i made him speak , where someone was asleep , i woke him up , where someone was ignorant , i made him wise
those who have worked hard to ward off evil have become a refuge for the wanton
these are of course not my words because only the " eloquent and erudite " would use them , according to al-aqqad 's view , may god break up the stones under his dead head
by the way , the word " ibashbish " is actually a literary arabic word
this is part of the complaint of the literate farmer , a film by the great shadi abdulsalam
the film is a short story film taken from a pharaonic text of the same name from pharaonic literature of the middle kingdom in 2200 b . c .
it was written and directed by shadi abdulsalam
set and costumes by salah marii
director of photography mustapha imam
ahmed marii played the farmer
you can download the film from the website above and read it but of course , i can 't promise you that you 'll see it because that is not in my hands , even though i know cinema is an image but we all we possess at present is our imagination
the film is produced by the ministry of culture 's national film center in cairo
that is now that wreck of a building on 36 sharif street in the city center
goodnight ! ! ! !

an iraqi national guard official in the al-ishaqi area in samarra ( 125km north of baghdad ) announced his resignation from his post on monday along with 30 others in response to the association of sunni muslim scholars prohibiting assisting the american forces after their recent attack on fallujah , the most prominent sunni stronghold in west baghdad .
captain dhia ali khdair , commander of a national guard brigade in the al-ishaqi area , told agence france presse : " i resigned from my post along with 30 other national guardsmen including two officers because the association of sunni muslim scholars has prohibited working with american forces in the aftermath of the fallujah incidents .

muqtada al-sadr links his participation in the iraqi elections to the withdrawal of foreign troops
baghdad ( 12 / 14 / 2004 )
( afp )
on tuesday , the young shia leader muqtada al-sadr linked the participation of his movement in the iraqi elections , scheduled for january 30 , to the withdrawal of foreign troops from iraq or at least to a " timetable " for their withdrawal .
al-sadr 's office said in a statement issued in the holy shia town of najaf ( 160 km south of baghdad ) " i hope our religious authorities and leaders obtain a pledge from the occupier and its followers and oppressive armies to leave the country or to timetable their withdrawal for immediately after the elections . "
he added : " otherwise , not taking part ( in the elections ) is a probability . "
it should be noted that al-sadr 's movement did not participate in the " united iraqi coalition " list which has ayatollah ali al-sistani 's blessing , the leading shia religious authority , and includes most of the main shia parties as well as independent candidates .
the statement said : " whoever can tolerate taking part under the yoke of occupation then his participation must be a prelude to the occupier leaving ; otherwise i will not bother myself about something that is useless . "
he added " i want my country 's independence and my people 's freedom and i want fair elections to take us out of the darkness and into the light " and called on movements , parties , denominations and religions to " reject sectarianism and unite . "

alawi announces the trial of " symbols " of the former regime are to commence next week
baghdad ( afp ) 12 / 14 / 2004
the president of the interim iraqi government , iyad alawi , announced on tuesday to the interim iraqi national council that the trial of " symbols " of saddam hussein 's former regime will commence next week , without specifying a particular day .
alawi said : " next week , the trial of symbols of the former regime will commence . they will appear one after the other before the judge so that justice is done in iraq . "
he did not specify who the trial would start with : former iraqi president saddam hussein and 11 other officials held by the american forces or the majority of those held whose names appeared on a list of 55 compiled by the occupation authority . however , he hinted in his answer to questions put by the council that it would include saddam and former senior officials .
alawi said that the interim authority , with the transfer of sovereignty on june 30 , is committed to " holding the trial quickly " . he pointed out that procedures for setting up a special court are " complicated " , especially as they are being carried out " under international monitoring " .
he said that " there is clear monitoring by human rights organizations such as the red cross " and that " fixing the list of charges , preparing the judges and finding impartial judges willing to face the dangers " takes time .
he added : " after having completed the procedures and appointments , we can say with confidence that the trial will begin next week . "
he said : " the trials will begin next week , in a gradual and continuous way , against those who committed crimes against iraq . "
for his part , badei arif izzet , the only iraqi lawyer among the team defending deputy prime minister tarek aziz , ruled out the possibility of the trial beginning next week . he told agence france presse that " it is unlikely that the trial will begin next week . the investigation files are not ready and the lawyers have not seen the case documents " , saying this would take " one to two months " .
he went on to ask : " on what basis does the trial begin ?
if it starts before the accused are questioned in the presence of lawyers , then it will be null " , and said he thought that alawi meant " the start of the investigation and not the trial " .
it should be noted that the only defendant who has so far met with his representative is former vice - president taha yasin ramadan .
saddam hussein and 11 of his associates attended a hearing session on july 1 during which an iraqi judge read out the charges against them at the american military base near baghdad airport .
the special court 's task , set up by the coalition authority in december 2003 , is to look into the allegations against the defendants " of mass genocide , crimes against humanity , war crimes and breaching iraqi law . "
there is a contradiction in the date set for the start of the trial between statements made by iraqi officials and statements by american officials . on december 6 , the iraqi transport minister louay hatim sultan al-aris stated that saddam hussein 's trial would begin after the general elections , saying that it would " not need much time but will begin after the election in january . "
in answer to a question about the body that is to try saddam hussein , the iraqi minister said it would be " independent and composed of iraqi judges . "
iraqi officials are still talking about the trial beginning before the end of 2004 or before the general elections . however , the americans have always said the trial was scheduled for 2005 .
for its part , the american state department yesterday , monday , played down the significance of the slowness in preparations for saddam hussein 's trial . spokesman richard boucher said that " preparing for a trial of this complexity takes time . we understand this . "
boucher expressed his hope that progress would be made in early 2005 , without disclosing the nature of that progress .
he said that preparing to try the former dictator and his main followers " is taking place backstage prior to moving onto the next phase . "
he said that " for example , a database has been set up on mass graves and the names of the missing . this work is not obvious and i expect things to become clearer by early 2005 when the trials start and the court 's foundations are organized . "
american forces captured saddam hussein on december 13 , 2003 after he disappeared from sight for nine months .
a special iraqi court will try him and he may face the death penalty .
on the other hand , alawi announced on tuesday that the cousin of deposed president saddam hussein has been captured in the town of fallujah which saw deadly battles last month between american forces and gunmen . he said that " some elements of the former regime , especially the main forces in saddam 's structures , still want to harm iraq and iraqis " . he added that " iraqi forces captured izzedine majeed ( saddam hussein 's cousin ) red - handed , so to speak , in the town of fallujah . "
he said that izzedine majeed " left iraq with hussein kamil then came back and started to move " . "
he said that " he is being questioned at present and he will be brought to trial at a later date . "
izzedine majeed al-tikriti ( 44 years old ) was an officer in the iraqi republican guard and fled to jordan in 1995 with hussein kamil and saddam kamil . his wife ( hussein kamil and saddam kamil 's sister ) and his four children were killed along with hussein kamil and saddam kamil by saddam hussein 's regime when they returned from jordan to iraq .
alawi said it was likely that terrorist operations would continue in iraq after the legislative elections set for january 30th " and may well escalate " .
he said : " i state that the process is not easy and this issue will not end on january 30th . "
he added : " after the elections , terrorist acts will not stop and may well escalate . "
he said that it is " a battle between the forces of good and evil : evil forces that want to destroy iraq and we who represent the forces of good and want to work towards an iraq based on democracy . "

a turkish diplomat who wished to remain anonymous stated " his wife contacted us and said he disappeared six or seven days ago and that he was last seen near basra " in the south .
the black - and - white video , broadcast by the channel on saturday , showed a man speaking in turkish and english who said his name was qahraman sadikoglu and that he was the owner of a freight company working in the towns of basra and um qasr in southern iraq .
another man was seen at his side who sadiqcoglu said was captain ahmed
the television said the latter was a turk who worked as a captain of one of his ships .
sadiqcoglu said the tape was filmed on december 23 and added that " we were captured by a group four or five days ago for the alleged reason that we are doing wrong in iraq . "
he stated that his kidnappers were making investigations about the hostages and expressed his hope that he and his colleague would be released after the investigations are completed .
he said that " the investigation will go on for a few days and they will decide whether we have done something wrong or not . "
he added : " we have no problems with the iraqi government and have never done anything wrong . "
he also said that he was being treated well .

baathists left ( through saddam 's door ) and come back to power ( through the window of elections )
saturday 1 / 30 / 2005 hilla ( reuters )
the huge mass grave discovered near the town of hilla in central iraq in may 2003 is of itself enough evidence of the barbarity of the baath party led by deposed president saddam hussein .
however , 20 months after human remains were discovered in the horrifying graveyard , some members of the baath party which committed this massacre have adjusted their allegiances and will run in the elections as members of various parties .
some of them admit that they were members of the baath party , saying they had no choice but to join the party in order to improve their job prospects .
however , many others are , as some say , less transparent .
muzahim jazairi , a candidate of the communist party in hilla , said
" baathist can always find a way to come back , for example by changing their addresses and using their old links with officials or with bribes . "
" they go out the door but come back through the window . "
no former prominent member of the baath party should run in the elections .
all former ordinary members have to sign documents stating they have renounced the party and that they were never involved in any of the crimes it committed .
the decision to allow former junior baathists to run in the elections has caused controversy but the majority of iraqis appear to accept this .
abbas hassan irbadi , a communist party candidate in hilla , said
" in some ways , the presence of a few baathists in power has some advantages "
adding that at least the baathists have experience .
he said that " most baathists joined the party because they were forced to or because they needed this to get jobs . "
hassan 's view is shared by jaffar mahmoud al-awadi , a candidate on the iraqi nationalist alwifaq list led by interim president iyad alawi , himself a former baathist who broke away and fled from iraq in the early seventies .

i don 't know what 's behind all the hacking of arabic sites
every site i go to i find has been hacked
the most recent was the arab security site
and the list goes on , before that it was the alibda site and alfareeq alarabi ,
what puzzles me is that the people who have hacked these sites are arabs themselves
good god , some of us build , and others destroy
so when will our structures stay up ? ?
how long are we going to carry on destroying what we build ?
this is a question i put to all those who want to hack

merciful god , when will the building finish if you build and others destroy

this is an ambitious program to organize the php language base and our friend has spared no effort , god grant him luck
he says in the introduction to this project : " let me start the series by letting our imagination play with this example :
imagine that you go into your room one day and are surprised to find it in a mess ( disorganized ) , maybe you find the fan on under the bed or the bed in a mess and the clothes closet upside down and the pillows crumpled
i 'll stop here . . .
but i have a question : can you use that room after this ?
you might say to me that you can 't use this room again
but i 'm going to surprise php programmers ( god have mercy on me ) and say that their answer will be yes as long as the room has a bed in it , even if it 's in a mess , i will sleep in it
and if the fan is under the bed , that 's easy , i 'll sleep under the bed
and if the cupboard is in a mess , no problem , as long as it has clothes in it
so i can still live in this room as long as i can use it
why was this the php programmer 's answer
why didn 't he think of tidying up the room ?

every year , as eid approaches , i remember these two poems , one by al-mutannabi in which he says in the opening lines : eid , in what state have you come oh eid with something that has passed or something new
as to the loved ones , the desert is between us as to you , i wish there were deserts between us and more deserts between the deserts .
the second is by the poet abdulrahman al-ashmawi which on the whole describes why i remember it during the eid . it is called " disappear , oh crescent moon " :
they said : it will bring us the happiest eid , a happy eid , while the earth stays damp
he who is rich with the blood of the martyr and war is bored of itself
and is nauseated by what it is annihilating
happy eid in the palaces of the affluent
an arduous eid in the refugee camps
oh crescent moon , our steps have become old and the distance to happiness is still far
oh crescent moon , disappear , do not return with whimpers of a happy eid
i do not want an eid with its aorta cut
do you think eid is sweets and new clothes
do you think eid congratulations in newspapers disappear oh crescent moon and reappear when time smiles again and the fires of tribulations die
disappear when the evening blooms with our smiles and the winter snow melts on our roads
reappear with fragrance , with glory and clear victory
reappear with the unification of muslims
this is a happy eid and anything else to us is not eid
disappear oh crescent moon until you see the flag of our nation fluttering in pride , then there will be eid , what a eid
there the wretched man smiles happily and every year the nation of islam is blessed
anonymous
oh eid , you return and my tears are its source
the heart is caught between swords and spears
hope has left the soul
for you have disappeared . . . like a house without a light
grief has pervaded my very being
between the wounds like a surgeon 's knife
every year , you are under a blockade
my regards

the trap of globalization , the most recent book i 've read
( i finished it today and started it during the eid al-fitr holiday )
what do you know about globalization , what is it ?
what is it aiming at ?
to whose advantage is it ?
these are all questions you 'll find an answer to in this book but with an unusual perspective and depth
a factual not fictitious perspective , based on figures rather than hearsay .
the essence of this book is that globalization aims at making a fifth of society wealthy , incredibly wealthy
and the other four - fifths wretchedly poor
yes , this is the globalization that we have so long heard will bring humanity prosperity and happiness ,
this is its trap as the authors try and explain .
the book is published by dar al-marifa
the text was translated from german into arabic by dr adnan abbas ali
i wholeheartedly recommend you read it as soon as you have a chance to do so .

if you 're someone who uses a computer , you will have come across the problem of trying to find a particular file .
if you have 44 000 files , then you 'll have problems extracting a particular file .
so you 'll have to look in webends and wait a long time to get a result , possibly several minutes .
is there an easier solution ? what do you think about putting google on your system so that it can search for a particular file ? ?
good idea , i 've used it and have been amazed by it , i can search for any word or excel document or even a pdf file in just a few seconds
and the program is no bigger than 500kb . it 's worth trying ! ! .

last friday , when i left to go to the mosque for friday prayer , i left the door to my room ( i rent a house with a group of young guys near the university ) unlocked in my haste
i had left my cell in the room
before i left , something in me told me to lock the door but because i was in a rush . i dismissed the idea because i never lock the door when my friend and i go out
anyway , when i came back to the house , i found my phone had been stolen ! !
the funny thing is that i had been meaning to change my phone for a while but i hadn 't done so , then it was stolen
the device was suffering from chronic diseases and the cost of having it repaired was equal to the cost of a getting another second - hand phone ! !
and today i got an exchange receipt and the matter was resolved
i have a new model ! ! but the loss was losing phone numbers stored in my stolen phone
i 've learned a lesson and that 's to write down all necessary numbers because the day may come when i need them ! !

abu thuraya has decided to stop writing in arabic because he is a turk from china and arabic is his second language , or third language i don 't know
the point is , i think he 's on the point of getting married and settling down
may god grant him all that he wants and hopes for .
anyway , his log was one of the most enjoyable logs i 've read in terms of usefulness and seriousness
i hope there are others like it
i expect that abu thuraya will come back to writing in arabic because he 's addicted to it

the most important issue at the present time is not the issue of palestine or iraq or backwardness or poverty or freedom
no , these are secondary matters with no importance for us arabs
it is well - known that the arabs are the people of language and love
the arabs , from the days of antar and qais and even nancy ajram and ruby , have been discussing the only concern of the arabs : love .
yes , love . thousands of songs , poems , films , series and meetings , all deal with this concern .
every day , we get people who try and deal with this issue with a new poem , a new form , and possibly even with new clothes or maybe a new body as well
even the songs of the street musicians are about this concern
so we ask god to grant us patience with this affliction , the affliction of love
! ! anyone who wants fame only has to enter the realm of love and its arts
remember to add some spices and you won 't have to wait long at the doors of fame
whatever has been said about love and its art , you will find something to say , even if it 's repeated
glory to god , what a fertile subject it is
try and talk about the love arts at any gathering and you will find a strange reaction
but what 's heartbreaking is that in spite of nancy ajram and ruby 's attempts to make people understand love , you 'll find people who only know love as a word
glory to god ( i 've started to doubt nancy and ruby 's ability to pass on information ! ! )
long live love and lovers ! !
he who has worries only the gallant knight knows it ! !
you see this knight riding the back of a horse . . . but you 'll realize later . . . he didn 't mount it on his own . . . rather with the help of a ladder ! ! because he didn 't practice mounting a horse ! !

some old friends , brothers and sisters from the islamic al-ibda forum have joined the blogging world
i would like to congratulate them on the occasion of the inauguration of their blogs . they are fahad al-saidi , nasser al-husseini and talebet elm 2
i would also like to salute the people of china for honoring me with a visit to my blog
i also haven 't forgotten our dear abu shanab office people
welcome to my humble blog ! !
hehehehe
in the name of god , whatever god wills
all we need is abdullah to start his blog
and another for the abi shanab office ( where are abu shanab 's men , god have mercy on those days )
then maybe the office will put up the same kind of topics of that it used to in al-ibda
god bless you brother zayed . . .
i got the idea of a blog when i saw your blog
i sat down that day to have a think . . .
and said
where have that al-ibda lot have gone ?
i now they 're innovators
and shutting down al-ibda didn 't stop them from continuing to take steps forward on the net
so i thought i 'd look for them . . .
because they 're good people
i wrote the word " zayed al-saidi " in the google search engine . . . and this blog came up among the results
and i realized that zayed al-saidi is the same zayed al-saidi from al-ibda . . .
i was happy to find my brothers . . .
after this , i thought about setting up a blog . . . and putting my articles in there . . .
i hope brother zayed 's blog will be another innovation . . . where we meet
may god grant good luck to all those who love and please him . . .
to be honest , i stopped going on the net about a month ago
i 've missed him so much , the idiot
hehehehe
i know he never took any notice of me
unrequited love
hahahaha
to be honest , i was very , very happy to see the new blogs by our brothers from the islamic al-ibda forum
i don 't know what to say
should i say god 's mercy be on him or that god got him out from behind the evil abdulrazzaq 's bars
by the way , zayed
do you knew abdulrazzaq 's address
i 'm going to tear him to pieces and feed him to the lions for what he 's done
no - one has ever upset as much as him but he 's going to pay the price
just let the forum open then we 'll plan the rebellion . . .
don 't tell him
by the way , i 'm also preparing a surprise , a blog in my name lol
but as usual , i 'll look for a new name to start my blog life with
hehehehe
it 's under construction at the moment and i 've got a cold
how can i change the font in a log

today , i am taking my patient into the operating theater
to give you an idea about the patient 's condition , i 'll describe what he 's suffering from
he says he feels a general weakness even though he has every reason to feel relaxed
he has a team taking caring of him ( spoilt )
let 's be precise in diagnosing his condition , in general he can 't deal with what 's around him , because his ability to show what 's inside is somewhat restricted
when he talks to his friends , you find he suddenly stops talking without warning
as well as feeling dizzy when trying to contact distant people
after a period of treatment with ordinary medication , he found this was not enough , so we went to see someone for a diagnosis
after discussions about this incurable case , the committee decided to carry out an operation to change all that is inside ( god forbid )
i don 't know what this has got to do with his condition ? !
the date of the operation was today , in the afternoon to be precise
the operation lasted until dusk , about 3 hours , but for reasons not taken into account , it failed
thank god the patient didn 't die , the surgeon found the new intestines had a fault so decided to put the old intestines back in and hope for the best
all the surgeon could do was change the optic nerves ! !
so as not to leave you in a state of perplexity , the patient is my computer and the surgeon is me
zayed al-saidi
as usual , i went to the computer lab to find a crowd of students , from internet browsers to report writers
some of them were spending the time chatting and a minority was there to learn technology programs
thank god the university didn 't waste efforts in providing computers with high specifications and good programs
i entered the world of the internet to find the machine ( may god restore it to health ) afflicted with a virus of the kind where you have to re - boot the machine ! !
talk turned to viruses and the money the university has to spend to put matters right
matters progressed to talk about windows systems and their security weakness and how expensive they are
challenges , yes , because the university as it tries to raise its standard of education , as it is now , has to spend thousands and possibly millions of riyals ! !
everyone knows the university does not have an endless treasure trove of gold , only a limited budget
that 's why a way has to be found to lower these costs in a way that doesn 't affect the standard of education so that there are more opportunities to develop other teaching accessories / free world
! ! anyone searching the internet will find a lot of arguments for what are called open source programs
among their supporters and windows supporters and the like , some of which are free and others that have to be paid for , some where you can see the constituent parts and others locked with an iron lock
the philosophy of open programs is that you get all the programs ( not just the right to use them )
you have the right to do anything as long as you give the code to whoever asks for it if you have developed it
the free world is a golden opportunity for whoever wants to develop his skills in the computer world
it gives you programs and their sources so you can study and develop and use them as you wish without restrictions or conditions
from start - up systems such as linux and freebsd
via office programs such as open office and koffice to browsers such as firefox and image editors such as gimp and even databases , the best - known of which is mysql
and for programming languages such as php and numerous program development mediums , these are all there for free and with open sources for whoever wants to study them and develop them
! ! a lot of educational establishments have started to move towards free programs
even government establishments and schools in some countries have moved fully to the free world
why a free world
! ! the question might be asked : why move to the world of open sources since the present system works ? the answer is , firstly the present system means spending on licenses for programs more than on buying the equipment itself
as a simple calculation , a high specification machine can be bought for 300 riyals in the worst case
whereas windows user licenses alone can be up to 70 riyals
and microsoft office licenses can be up to 300 riyals
if you want adobe photoshop , add no less than 600 omani riyals and the cost of the programs comes to 970 riyals and more
! ! this is in addition to the sums you spend on anti - virus systems
now multiply 970 by thousands of machines at the lowest estimate and you 'll get around 4,800,000 riyals spent on licensing machines used just by students , teaching staff and employees
in the world of open sources , you can spend these four million on setting up a specialist library for the engineering college and update its laboratory equipment
secondly , the educational standard will not be affected as students will learn open
instead of microsoft office
and will set up sites with nvu and draw with gimp
and if there are some materials related to windows programs , a few labs can be dedicated to this
by moving to open programs , there will be less emphasis on limited programming packages and we 'll go back to calling things by their real name , not their trade name
microsoft word is merely one way of word processing and not the only method of writing on a computer
microsoft frontpage is simply a tool for editing internet pages and not the only way of setting up internet pages
! ! thirdly , by moving to the world of open sources , there will be more opportunity to innovate , develop and depend on oneself
if we don 't find the necessary program or if we face a problem with a particular program
we can open the source and try to change it ourselves instead of waiting for someone else to be so good as to do it
we are in a place where we should be a model of innovation and discovery
fourthly , moving to the world of open sources will help establish the concept of intellectual copyright in students
and they will have respect for such rights
! ! however , if we say that it 's difficult to move to open sources , then this is the same feeble , weak talk and is not setting our sights high
the american university berkeley has set up its own operating system , a source of pride among other systems , and this is being developed by its best lecturers and students
so don 't we have the right to depend on ourselves , we who are a beacon of knowledge ? ? this is what is needed here in my opinion and i end by calling for the creation of an open program development center at universities
to supervise the move to the free world
and to identify requirements and to coordinate and develop the necessary solutions so that universities move to a unique and distinguished place at an international level
anonymous
wonderful words and it 's true , our universities need to move along this important path
with us , it 's started to be an optional module and some suggest
but in the end , these are individual efforts , not coordinated like they have
as you know , i hope these lands produce something organized to increase its improvement

yesterday , the results of the first part of the degree projects came out and i had thought our project was one of the best projects and would get the highest mark
this is not boasting but the truth , as the lecturers themselves said
anyway , the result was b +
so i said thank god , that 's a good result
i don 't think many are going to get that
and today , when i went to the university , i found most of the students had the same result although they didn 't put in as much effort as us
we thought , never mind , it 's still a good result
but what gave me a shock was that one group of female students got a - and their level of work , as their supervisor said , was not as good as our work
when we asked one of the lecturers , he said they were better at presentation and " attractive "
i won 't translate it , those who understand it will laugh secretly
in brief , a system like this only knows that being attractive is better than those whose pastime is not being attractive ! !
and after some give and take , we came up with the result keep smiling

in a forum , i found a topic criticizing an arab government and asking it to limit the scope of islam
it went on to justify this by saying modern - day muslims believe in things that prevent advancement and stand in the way of progress
it stresses that islam is a religion of forgiveness and civilization
and that these people have misunderstood it
it goes even further to say that these people ( muslims ) for example boycott present - day economics and dealing with banks
it mentions the issue of interest
and that they also oppress women
it gives the example of turkey which is a ( muslim ) country which has not criminalized adultery ! !
as i read this article , i realized that this person had not read the koran with understanding
and as the koran is the basic mechanism of islam , no muslim can oppose what is in it
such opposition would be opposition to god , great is his majesty
interest for example is prohibited in the text of the holy koran
the almighty says :
" oh ye who believe , fear god and give up the interest that is outstanding if you are believers "
( the cow : 278 )
and says about criminalizing adultery
give the adulteress and adulterer a hundred lashes each and let no pity for them cause you to disobey god if you believe in god and the last day and let their punishment be witnessed by a number of believers "
( light : 2 )
the solution to this quandary in the secularists ' view is to do away with these verses
i 'm certain that if muslims didn 't have a text prohibiting interest and adultery , they would not oppose the secularists on these points ! !
this is an absolutely impossible solution , and any debate about it will be of no use at all ! !
the second contradiction in that article , which i didn 't understand , is that on one hand , it calls for a true islam and on the other hand , rejects some of islam 's commands
how can you bring together something and its opposite ? ?
it 's clear these secularists want to apply western civilization in its entirety to islam and its people
they have made no effort to reconcile islam and western civilization as their logic is either secularism or islam ! !

we might hear a lot of jokes , some of them make us laugh , some don ' t
but the strange thing is that some jokes make some people laugh and seem silly to others
maybe this behavior is because if jokes are about a particular person or group of people ( like the politics of a particular country ) , they are more acceptable and so on . . .
anyway , here 's a story i heard from a friend , it goes . . . in a canadian hospital , there were lots of deaths for no reason at the same time every week in the resuscitation room , at 11 o ' clock on sunday mornings to be exact ,
the hospital rallied all the doctors there to investigate this strange situation
the doctors carried out tests and diagnoses on the people who died
in the end , they gave up on trying to find a convincing reason for this phenomenon
but the hospital administration insisted on figuring out this mystery so called in doctors from outside the hospital ( i think ! ! )
but the result was not what was wanted . anyway , everyone gave up on this amazing and frightening phenomenon and decided to take the role of observers of the patient who would die the following week in the resuscitation room . they all came to the resuscitation room at 10.30 , half an hour before the time ,
before i end the story , imagine the surprise they would have . . .
they found the cleaner ( indian ) unplugging the electrical wires from the medical equipment and plugging in the vacuum cleaner and cleaning the place ! !

there 's a new book on nutrition called dr. shapiro 's permanent weight loss program
it 's published by al-dar al-arabiya liluloum , you 'll find it , god willing , at the book fair
the writer is american and of course the book is translated and the idea is nice
the book says you don 't have to feel hungry to lose weight , you can enjoy food without putting on much weight . it 's a matter of choices .
the book shows with pictures that a croissant with cheese has 650 calories , instead of which you can eat 6 sandwiches made of light wheat bread + one and a half slices of cheese + lettuce , tomato and dressing and these six sandwiches have 650 calories and will fill you while a croissant won ' t
the book has many wonderful and appetizing examples as well as lots of practical advice
i recommend you buy it

a friend said to me " have you taken such - and - such a subject ? "
i said yes
he replied " i took it this term and want you to give me the papers for it "
( student expression which refers to everything about the subject from short tests to half - year exams and final exams )
i said " god willing "
the days went by quickly and he hurried me to get the papers . so i opened last year 's files and found the papers and contacted him to come and get the papers . he came quickly to get them .
after leafing through them , he said " where is the homework you did for this subject "
i said " why do you want it ? "
he said , pretending to be clever , " i want to use it to help me do the first homework we 've been set for this subject "
i said that it wouldn 't be any use and tried to apologize and get out of it any way i could but our brother insisted so i said i don 't give anybody my old homework because that 's my hard work and not yours and the grade you 'd get for it would be mine and not yours
no more than a few days passed until a second person came to me saying have you got the papers for such - and - such a subject
( this was about a programming language that needs practice )
so i said , trying to get out of it , " it doesn 't have any short tests , only half - year and final exams and homework "
he replied : " have you got the homework "
i said yes
he said " i want it "
so i said " i never give anyone my homework "
he answered " he who conceals his knowledge . . . " , quoting the noble hadith
so i chose to keep quiet and i thought to myself if you don 't do your homework , you 'll get a very low result
from my experience , programming languages require original thinking stemming from the person himself , and not ready - made ideas from others .
one term , i had a good friend who took a subject i had studied before
he took my homework for that subject and used it to help him do his homework
i kept telling him not to depend on it and that he should do his work on his own without using any outside source
he used to answer me with " i understand the subject and god willing , i 'll get good grades in it " but i used to doubt the truth of this claim
and so at the end of the term , the results came out and showed that i was right in having doubts since the grades were low and not what was expected
he started to rave and rant about how these grades came about
these scenes , the scene of using other people 's homework , happens every term and every year and the reason for it is striving to be at the top on the backs of others
the result is generally losing out on being at the top
and we mustn 't forget the injustice they commit against hard - working students by getting grades that aren 't theirs
and now we move on to another scene typical of being at the top on the backs of others
there was silence in the laboratory and all you could hear was the sound of keyboards straining under the weight of typing fingers and everyone looked deep in thought trying to solve the difficult test
slowly , the blood of solutions started to flow through the connections of the computers , and as time went on , everyone felt the minutes to be seconds
the permitted time was coming to an end when suddenly someone opened the subject 's files , making use of the laboratory 's large size , and found the solution and with the ecstasy of the victorious , sent the solution to all his close friends in complete silence . . .
when the result came out , everyone got what they deserved , except that group who got higher grades than their average and did even better than students known to be very good at that subject
glory to god
this scene happened in every subject this group took so that those who didn 't know them well thought they really deserved these grades
they were always at the top but on the backs of others and not because of their own efforts and hard work .
another spectacle , when the lecturer came back with the test papers to a subject and said if anyone hasn 't had their paper back , come and see me in my office because that person has cheated
there was a moment of silence and each looked at the other with doubt and suspicion
what an embarrassing situation , to be told you 're a cheat , but the temptation of high grades seduces many of us unfortunately
hassan
a truly regrettable thing and which happens a lot and again and again in various universities and various departments
i think that universities and the education systems in our country play a big role in the existence of the phenomenon of copying .
if our systems were interactive and up - to - date , this phenomenon would decrease . another reasons for it is selfishness and the weakness of a person 's religious morals
maybe . . . such a student should think a little about how he would feel if he worked hard on a subject then someone else came along and took his hard work without lifting a finger by copying or cheating
if i don 't give my friend or acquaintance the solutions to the homework for a particular subject , i don 't think this is concealing knowledge
if he came to me to ask for help in understanding something he finds difficult in that subject and i was able to help but didn 't , then that would be concealing knowledge
sorry for going on so long
