The next item is the report ( A5-0068 / 1999 ) by Mrs Ayuso Gonz√°lez , on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , on the proposal for a Council Regulation amending Regulation ( EC ) No 2201 / 96 on the common organisation of the markets in processed fruit and vegetable products [ COM ( 1999 ) 376 - C5-0140 / 1999 - 1999 / 0161 ( CNS ) ] . 
( ES ) Mr President , Commissioner , Regulation ( EC ) No 2201 / 96 provides for the payment of aid to the tomato processing industry with a view to compensating it for the difference between the raw material price on the Community market and that on the world market . 
This aid is granted for a global EU quota of nearly 7 million tonnes , distributed at five-yearly intervals by product group of peeled tomatoes , tomato concentrate and other products . 
It is also distributed at yearly intervals , by Member State , on the basis of the average minimum price over the three marketing years preceding the year of distribution . 
Under this Regulation , quotas were allocated for the marketing years 1997-1998 and 1998-1999 . These were slightly modified in 1997 in terms of the distribution between the various product groups . 
Subsequently , for the next marketing year , the distribution was carried out on the basis of the quantities in compliance with the minimum price over the previous three marketing years , as specified by Article 6.4 of this Regulation . 
More than just amending the Regulation , the proposal adopts a Council of Ministers ' agreement . This is actually a derogation from the Regulation as Portugal did not produce the quota which it was allocated for the marketing year 1997-1998 , apparently due to bad weather . 
It is proposed that , for calculation purposes , Portugal is allocated a supplementary amount of 83,468 tonnes for 1999-2000 and , for 2001-2002 , the difference between the quota calculated on the basis of the amount actually processed in 1997-1998 and the quota resulting if that figure is replaced by 884,592 tonnes . 
This will have no financial repercussions for the other Member States as the Commission has made provision for an ad hoc budget to finance this supplementary amount for Portugal . 
However , this Council of Ministers ' agreement has caused some concern among producers in the other Member States , particularly Spain , Italy and Greece , which are very competitive in tomato processing and production . 
As the President is aware , there have even been demonstrations at the Ministry of Agriculture in Spain by those who feel that Portugal is being accorded an advantage . 
A fairer , clearer and more transparent method of contracts and allocations would be the threshold system , rather than the quota system . 
To a certain extent this would satisfy the producers of those countries which are more competitive . 
However , neither the Agriculture Committee nor this House intend to deny Portugal this supplementary amount to enable it to adapt and become increasingly competitive in its tomato production . Yet this would be a good opportunity to move from the quota system to the system of thresholds for individual Member States . 
This is the line taken by the amendments which I have tabled on this proposal to amend the Regulation . 
The first two amendments are to the recitals and state that the aid for tomato processing is important and that the quota is insufficient . The third amendment states that the Commission will submit , before the start of the next marketing year , a proposal for moving from quotas to thresholds . 
I hope the Commission accepts this . 
Mr President , Commissioner , allow me first to congratulate my colleague on her first report . 
I should like to include a few thoughts in my contribution which , I believe , not only deal with a purely technical matter but also offer a basic starting point , in that I think we should take a much more global approach to agricultural policy from the outset . 
European agriculture , and we all support a European agricultural model , must be configured so that farmers throughout Europe have a chance of survival . 
Agriculture and the whole of rural society must be viable , so that the generations which follow us inherit a habitat that is intact . 
This means that farming must be possible both in favoured areas and in disadvantaged and climatically exposed regions and peripheral areas . 
One of the remarkable features of our agriculture is its multi-functionality in the rural society and it must be configured so that farmers find optimum conditions for all manner of crops . 
One of the outstanding features of Europe is its variety and I am referring here not only to the variety of regions and cultures but also to the variety of products and foodstuffs which make Europe unique . 
Farmers make a huge contribution to the cultural identity of a region or a country because the products cultivated , the primary production , colours not only the cuisine but also the customs and philosophy of life of the people down through the generations . 
It also gives us close ties with our homeland . 
Without regional roots from which to develop , there can be no foundation and no basis for the future . 
Traditional cuisine , which has developed from regional crops , and these crops must of course be suited to the climate , is a delight to the palate , both of the local people and of anyone who enjoys trying different foods . 
It is precisely this wealth of local and regional specialities which is unique to Europe and it must be preserved because it is a treasure trove which compares with no other region in the world . 
Europe , I say it again , is and must remain in the future distinctive , famous and loved . 
So I ask you : have you ever been to southern Europe and tasted the tomatoes which flourish there ? 
They are distinctive . 
I think that we should ensure within the framework of European agricultural policy that these tomatoes can continue to be cultivated , harvested and processed in these regions . 
Suitable regulations must be laid down so that , when there are crop failures , there are also reasonable , flexible quota arrangements and a non-bureaucratic approach . 
One thing must be made clear at the same time , however , and that is that all these actions must go hand in glove with strict control and monitoring measures . I think that this would be a positive starting point for numerous sectors in the future . 
Mr President , Mrs Ayuso has carried out an important piece of parliamentary work with this report . I , too , am in favour of the benefit to be gained through this measure by a fellow Member State as dear to me as Portugal . 
This is all positive . 
On the other hand , I am against and in fact I condemn the way in which the Council has proceeded . 
It is reprehensible that the Council of Ministers should have decided on these disgraceful advantages , aimed at softening the blow of Agenda 2000 . 
I am not surprised that the Council is absent . It dare not show its face for it is ashamed by this grand finale , this final distribution of shameful perks , or should we say this muddle to end all muddles ? 
For this is the way in which the Council of Ministers has proceeded with regard to the how , when and why of this measure . 
We said as much on 14 June when we told President Aznar that he was failing to defend the interests of Spain and that he was damaging Spain ' s representation with this attitude . 
This is still true . 
An ad hoc budget is authorised for all this . 
For the year 2000 this will amount to over ESP 500 million - ESP 532 million to be exact - which is equivalent to EUR 3.2 million . 
So , congratulations to Portugal and shame on the Council . 
The rapporteur has been very explicit but has no understanding of why we have a regulation which is a tangle of incomprehensibilities and exceptions . 
The Council has worsened it instead of improving it . 
Mr President , we support the Commission ' s proposal for a temporary increase in the Portuguese processed tomato quota as a means of compensating for the low levels of production in the year 1997-1998 due to bad weather . 
It should also be noted that this additional sum does not even compensate for the whole potential production in normal weather conditions ; it merely mitigates the loss that has been mentioned , which was incurred when the Member States distributed the quotas . 
Concerning the proposals put forward in the report , we also feel that there needs to be reform , given that the current situation has harmful effects - as experience has already shown - but we must bear in mind that any reform will still have to take the results of the current year into account and the potential levels of production in Portugal under normal weather conditions . 
We therefore think that it is more sensible to increase and improve the current system for calculating quotas with increases in line with the total amounts of production aid and not to move towards a system of guarantee thresholds that could penalise all farmers and not just those who exceed their quotas . 
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent report . 
She was willing to make proposals in the second part and she also formulated suggestions for future policy . 
We are discussing production aid for processed tomato products . 
This aid is based on processing quotas which correspond to a specific quantity of fresh tomatoes . 
The regulation makes provision for quotas to be distributed between Member States every year on the basis of production in previous years . 
The weather in Portugal was particularly bad during the 1997 / 98 marketing year . 
This resulted in a net drop in tomato production , which in turn led to a reduction of 83,468 tonnes in the Portuguese tomato concentrate quota when the quotas were distributed for the 1999 / 2000 marketing year and a concomitant increase in the quotas of three other Member States . 
A similar situation will arise when the quotas are distributed for the 2000 / 01 marketing year . 
The purpose of the present draft regulation is to solve this problem ; in other words , it increases the Portuguese tomato concentrate quota by 83,468 tonnes for the 1999 / 2000 marketing year and includes special provisions for setting quotas for the forthcoming 2000 / 01 marketing year . 
What we have is a one-off change to the quota distribution system which is limited in time . 
Its purpose is to solve a specific problem which has arisen in one Member State . 
This amendment notwithstanding , the Commission intends to conduct a comprehensive review of this regulation . 
The Commission will forward the results of this review to the Council during the year 2000 . 
Any amendments needed to the regulation and subsequent amendments to the regulation could then be applied with effect from the 2001 / 02 marketing year . 
The Commission will look into the recommendations in the three proposed amendments in detail as part of this comprehensive review . 
The purpose of the amendments tabled is mainly to replace quotas with a guarantee threshold , to be divided between the Member States , and to increase these quantities . 
Until such time as the results are available from this comprehensive review , which will also take account of budgetary constraints , the Commission cannot accept these proposed amendments . 
I say this because these proposed amendments go far beyond the very limited specific problem on which a decision is needed today , but I would like to stress that the Commission acknowledges that the proposed amendments are most constructive . 
Thank you , Commissioner . 
The debate is closed . 
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m. 
( The sitting was closed at 10.50 p.m. ) 
Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting 
The Minutes of yesterday ' s sitting have been distributed . 
Are there any comments ? 
Mr President , I would like to express my extreme disappointment at the fact that the President of the Court of Auditors did not give his report yesterday . 
He should have given his report . 
He should have cancelled any other engagements he had . 
He should have prioritised giving that report to Parliament . 
We only ask him to do that once a year , and any other engagement should have been secondary to this very important opportunity to let us know exactly how he feels about the European institutions . 
I am very disappointed , and I would ask you to write to the President of the Court of Auditors to express the disappointment of the House . 
Thank you very much for your comments , Mrs Morgan . 
I shall do so . 
I must also say that I have noted your comments and that the Conference of Presidents will also be taking note of this matter . 
Mr President , I have a point to make on the same subject . 
Time was obviously in short supply , yet the agenda went out on time and we knew how things were to proceed . 
I deeply regret that this happened and that the impression has now been given that Parliament was not prepared to accept the report . 
I would urge that we take up contact with the Court and arrange things in such a way that there is enough time for the Court ' s report at the next part-session in Strasbourg . However , we also need to ensure that the President can attend and present his report . 
It is not acceptable for us to be forever postponing this . 
I would not wish there to be a major interinstitutional fall-out over this . 
It is quite usual for us to receive this report at the end of the year , normally in November . 
This could have been done in this part-session . 
It is a matter of deep regret to me that it could not be so . 
Thank you very much , Mrs Theato . 
Your comments are relevant and fair and I think that in the next part-session , in Strasbourg , things will be done and organised in accordance with your protest , or rather , your comments . 
Mr President , when a Parliament , in a most irresponsible way , closes the door to political opinions , as happened yesterday among us , it is opening wide the door to armed struggle . 
We , Euskal Herritarrok , believe that political conflicts have to be settled by political means , but what we have seen in this House was in fact support for violence . 
This Parliament undoubtedly backed the Northern Ireland peace process , and I also wholeheartedly congratulate the Irish people and everybody inside the United Kingdom for their success . 
The 1993 Downing Street Declaration , recognising the right to self determination of the Irish people , shows us better than anything else that only through political negotiation can a real and lasting solution be found anywhere . 
Could we expect a similar analysis from the European Union to the on-going political conflict existing in the Basque country ? 
Could your European Parliament , Mr President , highlight the example of John Major and David Trimble to show Mr Jospin and Mr Aznar the path they have to embark on immediately ? 
Mr President , I asked for the floor yesterday but was not allowed to speak by the President at the time . 
I simply wanted to say , firstly , that the Spanish Constitution establishes a model of self-government which is infinitely more generous than that achieved by Northern Ireland . 
Secondly , this self-government has mainly been exercised by nationalist forces and , at the moment , is exclusively so . 
Unlike Northern Ireland , the ministerial posts are not shared between nationalists and non-nationalists . 
There are political forces - we have just seen them here - which disagree with the constitutional model given to us by the Spanish . 
However , our Constitution allows this disagreement to be voiced by peaceful and democratic means . The parties aiming to destroy constitutional order enter the elections under the flag of independence . 
What has to be decided at this point is whether or not it is legal to eliminate those who disagree . 
Mr President , I would like to end by saying that , for 40 years , the children of my generation listened wearily to a rhetoric which asserted that ballot-boxes were better off destroyed and that words should be replaced by fists and guns . 
The children who left Spain with clean hands will not return to hear this rhetoric again . 
Mr Garc√≠a-Margallo , as you know , and however important what you have said may be , this debate is clearly not on the Agenda , and I must keep to the Agenda . 
( The Minutes were approved ) 
Introduction of the Euro 
The next item is the report ( A5-0076 / 1999 ) by Mrs Torres Marques , on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , on the report from the Commission to the Council : Duration of the transitional period related to the introduction of the euro ( COM ( 99 ) 174 - C5 ¬≠ 0108 / 1999 ) . 
Mr President , I have here an illustration on the subject of my report that I would like to be distributed to all those present . 
I would be grateful if you would instruct that this be done . 
I would like to begin my intervention by thanking Commissioner Pedro Solbes Mira for being here today in the Chamber . 
I was told that the Commissioner had prior engagements , a meeting with the Central Banks , but that when he was told this debate was to take place at the same time , he chose to be here in Parliament today . 
I would like to acknowledge his choice and to thank him . 
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the scope of this report is the duration of the transitional period of the euro . 
On my proposal , the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs agreed to broaden its scope as the subject that had been proposed had , in the meantime , been superseded by various events , one of which was the European Parliament ' s own electoral process . 
Now , we have other real problems . 
The more hearings I have attended and the more reports I have read on these matters , the more convinced I am that the general tendency is , on the one hand , towards a drastic curtailing of the transitional period for the dual circulation of national currency units and euros and , on the other , towards having a frontloading period which it is anticipated will start from 1 December 2001 . 
The more we look into this problem and the more we talk to those directly involved - consumers and retailers - the more we see that the predominant idea is that the longer the period of dual circulation , the more complicated things will be . 
The idea that ' extending the transitional period will make things easier ' is finding fewer and fewer supporters . 
The illustration that I asked to be distributed gives a better explanation than many arguments can of the difficulties that we may have to face . 
Accepting as we do that the transitional period should last until 1 January 2002 , it is now important to raise the other problems , the proper resolution of which is of great importance to the credibility of the euro that we all wish to see . 
Therefore , in this report , Mr President , Commissioner , only maximum periods are referred to and preference is given to periods which are as short as possible so that all scenarios might be viable , even the legal ' big bang ' if , by 2002 , this is accepted as the best solution . 
Our main proposals are : 
firstly , a period of dual circulation of national currency units and euros which is as short as possible ; 
secondly , a period of advance feeding or " frontloading " to banks , retailers , public administrations and consumers from 1 December 2001 ; 
thirdly , to set prices in euros with their equivalent in the national currency , preferably by 1 January 2001 ; 
fourthly , information campaigns of increasing intensity until 2002 , particularly for the most vulnerable groups , through systematic action together with the education system , NGOs and the media in general ; particularly prime time television , television news broadcasts and sports programmes with high viewing figures ; 
fifthly , the increased use of electronic money , credit and debit cards and the creation of an electronic card or purse which can be used throughout the euro zone as soon as is technically possible and that its use is widespread enough for the cost to be minimal ; 
sixthly , the adaptation of vending machines for the use of charge cards until 2002 which will enable them , as far as possible , to work with coins and notes ; 
seventhly , the creation , to be postponed until 2002 at the latest , of an integrated payment system which will enable us to transform the euro zone into a market with the same rules as domestic markets . 
Mr President , each one of the issues addressed in this report requires more detailed and deeper examination , as their application needs to be completely secure , clear and fully accepted by our citizens . 
We therefore hope that the Commission will introduce the measures that it feels must be adopted in this area . 
On account of its implications for the lives of our citizens , this issue must be closely supported by the European Parliament , the direct representative of the electors . 
I hope that the Commission , the Council and the European Central Bank only take decisions that are fundamental to this issue , having consulted us first . 
Mr President , the third phase of Economic and Monetary Union entered into effect on 1 January of this year , as detailed in the Madrid scenario . 
Also , in accordance with this scenario , the Council , backed by this House , has decided that euro coins and banknotes will be circulated as legal tender as from 1 January 2002 . 
One of Madrid ' s key contributions is that it drafted a clear schedule early on , which was preceded by extensive deliberation . 
My group supports the Commission in its viewpoint that the so-called transitional period should ideally be maintained , despite the fact that its lapsing coincides with the frantic Christmas shopping period . 
Preparations are now too far advanced to be able to successfully implement any changes . 
On 1 January 2002 , the euro will become legal tender within the euro zone . 
National currency units will remain in circulation for a maximum of six months , but national legislators may decide to shorten this period within their territories . 
Many will not be fully aware of the advent of the euro and monetary union until they have to make the changeover in their own purses .
